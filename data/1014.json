I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Save your MONEY", "unixReviewTime": 1279756800, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2010"}
