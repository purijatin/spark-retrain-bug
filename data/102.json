I havent found another one that is so useful - even if you dont need it to extend this is still a great mount--- I guess for the price I was expecting something cheaper but I was quite surprised. It was easy to install and works for what I need it for - it may be over kill for a 22 inch LED LCD TV but I like the way it can be moved around.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the only mount I will buy", "unixReviewTime": 1293580800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2010"}
