Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.)  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a Bad Little Charger", "unixReviewTime": 1387065600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2013"}
