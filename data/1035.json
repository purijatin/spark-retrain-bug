As you probably know, when the Garmin is plugged into ones laptop via USB, it enters charge-only mode and you cannot use the device while it's being charged that way.  This unit enables one to charge the device in a hotel room without the need for a laptop and allows use in order to find an expensive Italian restaurant nearby.By the way, though the title says the LED is red, mine was actually blue (Horrors!)  That slight misrepresentation aside, I think this unit is well worth the investment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Device can be used while plugged into charger!", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"}
