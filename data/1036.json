I did buy the accessory kit for the Garmin 260W, and use the USB cable attached to my desk top to charge my Nuvi - for what it's worth.  Also, I might mention that the Sandisk 2GB SD card I bought for my 260w may not serve to increase \"memory\" for GPS Garmin Nuvi functions.  The SD card will hold photos and recall them to display on the Nuvi, but I don't know that it will service \"routine\" GPS functions.  If anyone has, knows, or gets information about this, I would like to hear about it.I conveyed this info so that people won't buy stuff that they really don't need, and expect it to do what it won't do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A/C charger for your Garmin?", "unixReviewTime": 1290729600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2010"}
