The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall.  Highly recommend this great quality product. This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern. We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there's a much better chance we won't need to replace the articulating mount.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High quality construction, comes with plenty of easy to install hardware.", "unixReviewTime": 1353456000, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2012"}
