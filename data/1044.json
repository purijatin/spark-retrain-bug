In my opinion, it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada. I don't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I don't know whether a bigger card is available.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works.", "unixReviewTime": 1390780800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2014"}
