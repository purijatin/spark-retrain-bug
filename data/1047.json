I use them on my GPS, HD video camera, Samsung tablet, laptops and including my desktop.  I do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable. That is important to me as I handle them a lot...back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music, my guitar recordings, lyrics....etc.  I have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Kingston Micro SD Card", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013"}
