Blue", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have been trying to update my Garmin Nuvi 1450 with the latest maps for quite some time with no success.  I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download.  On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time.  I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter.  For the low price and free shipping, this is a great deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fixed my update problem with Nuvi 1450", "unixReviewTime": 1365897600, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2013"}
