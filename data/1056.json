I also use one in my wife's camera.  Any time I use her camera, I swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card.  She has about 3000 pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album.  This card is so inexpensive that I use one to back up her photos even though I have never had one of these cards fail.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}
