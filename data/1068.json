But this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate.  Works way better than any FM transmitter I've ever tried (although I admit I gave up after the first one or two).  And the quality of this Maxell unit is at least as good as anything else I've come up with the last few years, particularly for the price.  The heads look well made (I've seen others that were downright crude) and the mechanism is quiet after six months' use.  Sound quality is certainly good enough, although my car is noisy enough that it's not a big issue.  I can't discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off CDs in the factory player, so it's sure good enough for me.  I'm not an audiophile, but if I was I wouldn't be messing with cassette adapters!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quiet, cheap, does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1339804800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2012"}
