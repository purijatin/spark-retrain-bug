Do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side? The problem is that most cassette adaptors can't accommodate both types of cassette decks.With this Maxell adaptor, that isn't a problem. The great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issues.NOTES-----------If you're not hearing anything, try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side. In my Rav4, cassettes load by inserting the narrow end. But since I didn't hear any audio, I thought this adaptor was broken. It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette, then there was no problem.Also try increasing the output volume of your iPod.TESTED WITH :------------A 2001 RAV4 and an iPod 30 gig and also an iPod Touch. They worked fine except for the set-up issue mentioned above.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Casette Adaptor with Unique Features", "unixReviewTime": 1250726400, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2009"}
