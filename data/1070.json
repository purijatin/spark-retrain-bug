It has a cassette drive, though and I had an additional MP3Player I did not use anymore, so I bought this gadget - and it works! Sound quality is surprisingly good, the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound. The only little annoyance is, that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel. But eventually I will fix it somewhere, where it is not in the way anymore.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Gadget", "unixReviewTime": 1210723200, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2008"}
