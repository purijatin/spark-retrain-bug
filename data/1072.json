I've been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging. It managed to last 2 years, which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lasted 2 years before the wire gave out", "unixReviewTime": 1304812800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2011"}
