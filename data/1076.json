I have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used.  Generally I turn my BlackBerry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo.  The sound quality is ok - it is a cassette after all.  The cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly.  I might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound quality.Also, the Dolby noise reduction is a must, otherwise you will get a lot of hissing.  I would say overall the purchase was positive, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Adequate Adapter", "unixReviewTime": 1270425600, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2010"}
