Unintentioanlly I saw this in a friend's car and I did some research and a week later it's in my hands. Well, I have to say this is an impressive tape adaptor. The sound quality is just as good as playing a CD and the stereo in my car reads it smoothly. On top of that, it's inexpensive!So if you are looking for a tape adapto for your iPod, you should get this one! :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful!
