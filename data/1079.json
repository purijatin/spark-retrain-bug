I tried several no Brand cassette adapters (crap! i wasted like 20 bucks on no name version)I say if u are an audiophile in your car and your iPod is a must everyday, get this Maxell adapter! its the only one i found to work fantastically on a lexus GS300 and a Honda and a Merc and Toyota factory installed players.This stuff i think has improved over the years. I don't hear any hissing even during classical performances!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the best iPod thingy...must have", "unixReviewTime": 1169164800, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2007"}
