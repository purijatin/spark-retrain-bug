I ordered this one to go in my Toyota Sienna 2001 which has a cassette deck. I chose this brand because I trust it more than the cheaper ones.  It plays good through my car stereo.  The sound is good enough, not as  great as when you have earphones on, but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway. So far I am satisfied with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ipod Cassette adapter", "unixReviewTime": 1285632000, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2010"}
