That one worked great until my car (Acura TL) decided to start doing the auto-reverse deal and constantly spit it out. Being the cheapo that I am, I wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car, and I was hopeful when I saw the reviews on this adapter. However, this product constantly clicks, and loud enough to distract me from the music playing. Also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my 15-year old sony adapter. There's a lot of white noise, and I have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where I can actually hear the lyrics of the songs.  I've tried fiddling with the wire, moving it in different positions, and pulling the wire straight, but it doesn't help. I've rendered the adapter pretty much useless, and for now am stuck listening to the radio until I decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my car.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Constant clicking, sound quality not very good", "unixReviewTime": 1297209600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2011"}
