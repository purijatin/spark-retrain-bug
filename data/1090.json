Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter.  Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better (and it's a buck cheaper to boot).  Indeed, the Philips was very good.  Buy it. Don't buy the Maxell. You'll be happier.UPDATE to review: about a year after purchase, the Philips is making louder and louder noises.  I guess noise is endemic to these adapters.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Works but obnoxiously noisy mechanicals", "unixReviewTime": 1342483200, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2012"}
