I ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that I could find in stores. However, I am not disappointed at all. The sound isn't quite CD quality but it's pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape. I don't have an FM adapter but from what I read, the cassette adapters have a much better sound.The other big bonus is that it doesn't matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed. Warning, some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction! Every once in a while I have to put the tape in twice for it to work right; otherwise I haven't had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound! Another tip: if you don't have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player, what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble (for me, if I have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder, I'll have more treble...and a little more static, too).As an aside, I doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1125187200, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2005"}
