Never cleaned the lens the entire time I own it.  Lately it's been scratching my CDs, and frequently not playing them.Put this lens cleaner in.  At first it wasn't doing anything, but the CD player just spit the CD right out.  Apparently the lens is really dirty.  After a couple times of putting the CD back in I heard instruction in track 1 saying that tract 2 only needs to be played the minimum of 20 seconds to get the lense cleaned.My player required 5 playings of full tract 2 to function properly again.When I took the lens cleaner out, I see a lot of dust on the little brush, and on the bottom surface of the disk (picked up by static?).  I think it has done its job, and now the CD player is playing my music again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works for my car CD player", "unixReviewTime": 1346025600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2012"}
