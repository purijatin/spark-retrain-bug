It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved.  Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music.  Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs.  If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Questionable benefit", "unixReviewTime": 1335916800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012"}
