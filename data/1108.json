Shipping via prime was rapid and arrival was in excellent condition. The product works just fine* thus hardening my position/opinion that Maxell products are of good quality and Memorex products are of lower quality.* My computer's drive can now burn a music CD at full speed and make a product which is playable on the same drive. Before cleaning, I had to reduce writing speed from &#34;fastest&#34; to &#34;medium&#34; to burn readable disks.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Maxell CD-340 Lens Cleaner!", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013"}
