It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1322870400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2011"}
