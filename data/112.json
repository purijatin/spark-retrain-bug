Miller", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35\" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55\" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If I had 3 TVs, I'd buy a 3rd", "unixReviewTime": 1376092800, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2013"}
