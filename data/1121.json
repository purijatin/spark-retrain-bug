Put this in today and followed instructions and after just 30-45 seconds, removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past. No problems now!!! everything I tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly. Probably saved me from ordering a new DVD drive for the PC. Should have had one of these discs months or years ago. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Grrr8!", "unixReviewTime": 1368489600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2013"}
