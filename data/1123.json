But it has worked on systems in the past.  Simple and fast to use, you just pop it into the player like a regular CD.  There is none of the nonsense with fluids like they had in the old days.  It's a simple mechanism- it has a small brush-like device that gently cleans the laser lens.So look at it like this: this is a cheap investment to try something that might work for your broken CD/DVD player.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Didn't work for me- but it works for many CD players", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}
