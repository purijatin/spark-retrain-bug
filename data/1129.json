But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment's lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Well as Far as I Can Tell", "unixReviewTime": 1254355200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2009"}
