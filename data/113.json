Product comes adequate with a lot of screws, an Alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts. The bubble level (with magnet on the side) and cable are a nice addition.Had to cut 1 inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the TV, since it covered some of the inputs. Other wise very practical for my bedroom/Study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job.For the price ($25 and free shipping), its is a really good deal. Would recommend this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Flexiable mount, had to cut to fit VIZIO E260MV 26\"", "unixReviewTime": 1320883200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2011"}
