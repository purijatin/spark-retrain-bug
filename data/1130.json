Campisi \"extrabooksalbany\"", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewtext": "I was having a lot of problems with my CD player skipping, refusing to play certain CDs, and randomly changing CDs. I thought I would have to replace it, which I didn't want to because it's a high-end one, and I just love the sound quality. In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player, in my case a 5 CD changer, and hit play. It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels. I was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly.Tonight I put in a CD that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song. Will wonders never cease...it played perfectly!Couldn't ask for a better product. Saved me a ton of money on a new, high end (I was going to choose a Yamaha) player.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Talks to you and saved me a new CD player purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1283644800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2010"}
