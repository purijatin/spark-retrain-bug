I like 'em simple and cheap, so long as they get the job done.Sound Quality: Well, they sound good to me. I've had some headphones sound tinny or &#34;weird&#34;, but these sound pretty normal. Mind you, I'm certainly no audiophile and I abhor &#34;bass&#34; in my music and whatnot, so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.Comfort: Actually, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long, due to the pressure on my head. I also can't wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell I'm wearing them - and so far, no headaches, even though I've worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall, I'd say I'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy (the brand changes, since I just buy the cheapest 'phones I can find by a brand I've actually heard of) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones. I haven't had them for long, so I can't speak to the endurance of them, but even if they only last a short bit, I think I'd actually just replace them with these same ones. They're really that comfortable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Cheap Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}
