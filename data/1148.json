They are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym.  Today I couldn't hear anything out of the right side so I'll need to toss them.  I was shopping around on Amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so I thought I'd add to it, seeing that it may be a common problem with this model.  I had only paid around $10-$15 in the first place.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Foldable but didn't last long", "unixReviewTime": 1198454400, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2007"}
