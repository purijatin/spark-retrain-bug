It is playing the tapes as before and I cannot tell any difference in sound quality, but I should say that the quality was never that bad. I used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved. I really don't know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty (or have other issues).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I am not sure if it cleaned", "unixReviewTime": 1289952000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2010"}
