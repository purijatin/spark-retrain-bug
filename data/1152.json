It performed exactly as described. It cleaned up the audio heads quite nicely...the music doesn't sound muffled or unclear. Now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to. If you own a \"retro\" tape cassette player, then by all means, get this audio head cleaner, it'll make it as good as new. Great product, highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Effective Maxell Audio Tape Head Cleaner", "unixReviewTime": 1376956800, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2013"}
