The Maxell 19 10 18 offers the quicker approach (It will not give you the results of the more time consuming).  The labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck (For the units that allow this) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid.If you want faster results, Maxell has done almost all the work for us.  The cleaner looks like a standard cassette.  The instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck.  Presto that is it!As always, try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book \"Take Me To A Circus Tent\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Clean the tape deck or it will be washed up fast!", "unixReviewTime": 1183507200, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2007"}
