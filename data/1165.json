And when my VCR heads get dirty, and when I play my old VHS tapes, and the picture is scratchy. I clean my VCR heads with the Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner. And after the simple yet highly efficient cleaning this product does, I rewatch the same tape, and the picture quality is as excellent as it was, if I was watching it off my my plasma TV for the first time! You are not going to find a better VCR head cleaner than the Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner guys!. No one can go wrong with this fantastic product. Thank you Maxell!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect VCR Cleaner", "unixReviewTime": 1280102400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2010"}
