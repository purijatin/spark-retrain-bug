This wet system gently cleans the heads where a dry system might harm them.  Do not order the CleanDR 60128 VHS video head cleaning system just because it is cheaper than this brand.  The CleanDR shows a bottle of fluid and describes it as a wet system, but it is not.  I ordered that first and was sent a totally dry cleaning tape which I cannot safely use with my old VCRs.  So I had to return and then I ordered this brand.  I am very happy with this purchase.  The boxes (I ordered 2) I received look just like the product pictured here.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great on old VCRs", "unixReviewTime": 1393891200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014"}
