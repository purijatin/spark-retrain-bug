Needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage. We liked it, but eventually, we will have to join the 21st Century and start getting DVR's  since it is impossible to but new (old) VCR's. It did the job, but this product can not be used all the time!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Still Old-Fashioned!", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2014"}
