I have 2 VCRs, both of which I rarely use anymore.  Between her old tapes and my old VCRs the picture and particularly the sound quality was awful.  After I used the Maxwell VP200 VHS Wet Cleaner, the picture and sound improved greatly - probably the same quality as it was when the tapes were originally made about 10 years ago.Product arrived quickly, and was easy to use.5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked Great", "unixReviewTime": 1244160000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2009"}
