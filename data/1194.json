In all the years of owning VCRs, I've never really felt the need to use a head cleaner-never really had a problem.Long story made short, what I originally thought was a hardware problem turned out to be dirty heads. I was getting sound but only noise on the video. This started again shortly after purchasing a second VCR to replace one doing the same thing which replaced two previously-owned, older units doing the same thing. There had to be something else. So, after checking all my connections and cables, I purchased this head cleaner. After adding the included cleaning liquid, I ran it for about 25-30 seconds. The thing plays like new; well, it was new, but I guess all these OLD tapes are depositing a LOT of residue on the heads as I run them through.I'll definitely be using this head cleaner regularly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WOW!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1271376000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2010"}
