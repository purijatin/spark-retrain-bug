I thought the cost was a little high, especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance (in camera settings, grey card, coffee filters...don't laugh, I did this and it was actually the next best thing to the Expodisc).  Well, I bought my Expodisc and I am a convert to the church of Expodisc.  This thing is awesome.  It gets me perfect WB every time, whether I'm using natural light, bounced flash, strobes, or a combination of all different kinds of light.  I have never once had to change the WB in post and my photos look awesome SOOC.  You can also use the Expodisc as an incedent light meter, which is pretty awesome.  I would totally buy it again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love the Expodisc!", "unixReviewTime": 1364515200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013"}
