I'm so sorry I didn't buy the Sony sooner!  The sound quality is tremendous.  It isn't waterproof but I keep it on a shelf in the shower and it withstands regular spraying with water with no problem.  I love the big preset selection (including local TV channels), the easy to use buttons and the timer that turns it off on its own.  Great machine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best shower radio ever", "unixReviewTime": 1154217600, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2006"}
