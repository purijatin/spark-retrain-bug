That's right...  my first Sony ICF-S79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model.  The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time.  The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons.  I would totally recommend this product because it looks great, last a long time, gets great reception, a huge amount of digital presets and much more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Shower Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1195603200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2007"}
