It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Made in R.o.C., but good for once", "unixReviewTime": 1334966400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2012"}
