I was searching for specific features:1. Battery power (for power outages)2. TV band (tornado tracking is sophisticated enough to get down to street-level tracking on TV. NWS hasn't caught up yet)3. Decent sound qualityThis radio met all my needs with the added bonus of being water-resistant. (I must admit I am baffled by the term as EVERYTHING is water-resistant to one degree or another.)Reception is good in all areas of my home (including those areas where we cower when tornados are lurking). The radio includes a wire antenna for FM reception which stows in the battery compartment.Sony recommends leaving the three &quot;C&quot; cells in the radio and changing them every year. This maintains the time and radio presets.Pros:  Good reception, solid design, handy controls, good sound.Cons:  Bigger than some.To avoid finding the radio with dead batteries (or worse, corrosion in the battery compartment), I set reminders in my Palm to change various batteries annually.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like this radio", "unixReviewTime": 1055721600, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2003"}
