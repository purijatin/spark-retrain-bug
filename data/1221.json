Aagaard", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I've bought Sony shower radios for 20 years - this is the third (and by far the best) model, and I've had at least one of all three models.  The digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station.  I love the presets, and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great.  The solid base means it's less likely to fall over, or off of things.  The radio is pretty tough - I've dropped it and had nothing happen, but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio.  And the batteries really do seem to last forever!  On the one I have now (five years old), the plastic waterproof top is cracking, and the FM antenna caught on something and pulled loose.  So, I'm buying another.  Don't EVER stop making this radio, Sony!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The BEST in an evolutionary series", "unixReviewTime": 1141862400, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2006"}
