Barnes \"Never enough tools\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I've had this radio for over 3 years now and the only problem is with the FM tuner (it died in less than one year).  It still works with AM, weather, and TV.  Since I use it for primarily AM, it's not a big deal.  Speaking of AM, this has absolutely the best AM reception of any radio I've had.One last comment: the batteries last quite a while.  I use it at least 20 - 30 mintues a day and have only replaced the batteries once in three years.If you're looking for a shower radio, this is it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the bathroom", "unixReviewTime": 1065657600, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2003"}
