This is absolutely the way to go if you want to listen to radio in the shower. I've had it for over 2 years now and it has been through just 5 batteries. It comes with a bundled antennae which you can stick to the shower's wall and reception is amazing. Buttons are easy to operate and it can even tune into local TV stations so you get the audio. Sometimes I do have to crank up the volume to hear over the shower noise, but I never go more than half way up. This shower radio is excellent, get it now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must if you like news radio in the morning", "unixReviewTime": 1284336000, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2010"}
