At $50 I was hesitant to purchase this radio but I'm delighted I did, it is worth every cent.1. Battery life is simply amazing, I listen to it for a minimum of 1-2 hours each and every day and I'm still on the first set of batteries after 5 months, I've even accidentally left it on for the entire day several times. Wow!2. Excellent reception for all bands; Am, Fm, Tv, and Weather.3. Simple, convenient buttons and operation. The o4. Peace of mind with water resistance, I've not placed it in the shower but do have it in the bathroom which often gets quite steamy.5. Excellent sound for the type of radio it is, clear and loud.6. Small footprint takes up little space.7. Like the wire antenna, didn't think I would at first. It is better than a hard antenna sticking up waiting to be bumped and/or broken.8. Timer and auto-off timer are quite nice also, even though I sometimes forget to use the auto-off timer.9. Digital tuning and display makes it simple to find the station you are looking for.10. The fit and finish is outstanding, the radio looks and feels very well constructed.Overall a worthy purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding Radio!", "unixReviewTime": 1151884800, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2006"}
