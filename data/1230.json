It has good sound quality & it's easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets.  The timer function is useful since it does run on batteries.  My only issue is that I wish an AC adapter was included so that I didn't always have to run it on batteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good sound, easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1202947200, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2008"}
