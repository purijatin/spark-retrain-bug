Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas.  I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations.  Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sound quality is pretty good and radio reception is very good", "unixReviewTime": 1167955200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2007"}
