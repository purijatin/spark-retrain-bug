The flat, broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sink.Be aware that the TV channel reception feature will cease in 2009 when all transmission goes digital. Until then, enjoy it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1197331200, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2007"}
