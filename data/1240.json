I bought 2 of this radio in August 2000 (yes, three zeros) and they bit the dust in late 2007.  I got about 7 years of EXCELLENT performance from these radios.  I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed.  The other goes between kitchen and office constantly.  There's 5 presets for AM.  I wish there were more.  There's 10 presets for FM.  One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused.  The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent.  The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.  After 7 years of pressing the on/off button I'm sure thousands of times, the plastic over the on/off button ate through.  The on/off button needs that plastic over it to work!!  The damn thing won't turn on/off now!!  I tried turning the volume down to zero to \"turn it off\" but the batteries do wear out and it's annoying.So I figure that 7 years of constant usage is pretty good and I am not complaining and have even come back for more!In spite of the 7-year life, I still give this radio the highest rating.  Fair is fair, right?  Can't complain about 7 years of perfect performance, can we?  I say no.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A FABULOUS RADIO", "unixReviewTime": 1202947200, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2008"}
