The reception is crisp and clear and I love the pre-programmable stations.  It is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me, it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  It's very user friendly; no complicated directions.  Perfect for us 50+ technically challenged.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Shower Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1226707200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2008"}
