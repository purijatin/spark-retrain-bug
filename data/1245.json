JEFFREY MCMAHON \"herculodge\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "After researching shower radios and looking at ones that cost almost twice as much, I decided on the Sony ICF-S79V and I am impressed with the following points:1. Great fit and finish.2. Not too big. Seems smaller out of the box than photos on Internet suggest. This is good for cluttered showers.3. Easy-to-use controls for clock, tuning and presets. I didn't even need to consult the manual.4. Excellent sensitivity for AM (internal ferrite antenna) and FM (a pull-out wire from the battery compartment).5. Full sound to overcome shower noise.6. Sony's decision to require 3 C batteries insures long-lasting life between battery changes.So far I have not found any weaknesses with the radio. Sony has found a niche in their shower radio. I give it the fullest recommendation, especially for the 45-dollar price (and free shipping no less) I found on Amazon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Fit and Finish for Shower", "unixReviewTime": 1166918400, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2006"}
