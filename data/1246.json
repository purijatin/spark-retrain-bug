It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a \"shower radio,\" this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this. I have to crank it fairly high to hear when I'm taking a shower (even though it's waterproof, I don't put in the shower with me). However, there's not distortion at high volume.I cannot say anything about the battery life yet, but overall I'm very satisfied with the radio.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice radio", "unixReviewTime": 1155081600, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2006"}
