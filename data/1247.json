Radcliffe", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "Edit:  Well it has been over 7 years since I purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust.  Radio still works (though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception)and the clock is still really hard to see.  It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud.  Husband tried to fix it but couldn't do it.  Seven years is pretty good, I guess. I don't see anything better on Amazon, at least for this price, so I will probably purchase another of the same.  Something I did not mention in my original review:  the batteries seem to last forever.  Same number of stars for the same reasons.Original Review: This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read.  I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there.  If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame.  There is no back light which adds to the difficulty.  I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you.  If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Excellent Radio - Poor Clock", "unixReviewTime": 1162598400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006"}
