It has excellent reception, clear sound, and the batteries last forever.I don't use mine in the shower itself, but sitting on the cabinet. Volume is very good.My recent purchase was a gift; there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well. They were cheaper, but if they don't work, what have you gained?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "excellent shower radio", "unixReviewTime": 1199750400, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2008"}
