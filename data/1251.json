It is easy to set up the time, presets, etc.  The sound and reception are great.  The controls are on top and protected.  The display could be brighter and I wish it had a way to hang it on the wall when not in use (it comes with a cord for hanging in the shower), but it is compact and does not take up too much space on the counter and it looks nice.  I haven't actually put it in the shower since I can hear it just fine from the counter.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sony Shower Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1181779200, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2007"}
