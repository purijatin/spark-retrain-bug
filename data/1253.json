I also use it around the house as a portable radio so it gets 1-3 hrs of use maybe once every other week.  They say the battery life is 80 hrs, but that must be if you use it 80 straight hours.  We received the radio in early March, put in 3 batteries, and they are still going strong (it is now December).  Amazing.  Sometimes I am shocked when I find a consumer electronic product that works well, works simply, and works reliably.  This is one of those products.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "exceptional", "unixReviewTime": 1187136000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2007"}
