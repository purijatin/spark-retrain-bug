Easy to read display. Great sound for a mono speaker.  Battery life is amazing.  Worth the price.  I would happily repeat the purchase if I manage to wreck this radio.Update:  The TV function of this radio is not functional with the digital TV change over.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1181952000, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2007"}
