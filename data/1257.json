I have listened to NPR in the shower almost every day since then, and it has lasted and performed well.  Finally the plastic cover over some of the buttons on top started to crack and break off, so I just bought a new one.  It lasts many months (6 months?) on 3 'C' batteries. The reception is pretty good.  I was hoping that Sony would have made it a bit more modern in appearance, but it looks decent enough for a shower radio.  I like the countdown timer, as I can turn it on for 30 minutes when I take a shower, and by the time I am done dressing it shuts off automatically.  Thus, I don't have to get back in the shower (wet floor) to turn it off.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First one lasted 13 years; just bought another one", "unixReviewTime": 1156550400, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2006"}
