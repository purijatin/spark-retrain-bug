I've had it for a little over 3 months and I listen to it daily for about 15 minutes at a time and I still have yet to change the batteries on it (2 AA I believe).  Prior to this shower radio I had a Brookstone am/fm shower radio which took 4 C batteries and I would have to change them about once a month.  I get great reception of my FM stations and I even get some TV audio through it, to listen to the Football games.  It's very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna.  All in all, I strongly recommend this shower radio over any other on the market.  No problems, no complaints....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Little Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1163894400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2006"}
