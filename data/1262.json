They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not what I'd hoped for.", "unixReviewTime": 1096934400, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2004"}
