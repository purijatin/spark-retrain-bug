Even so, there is a lot of pressure.  After about an hour they start to hurt my ears.  I have tried to \"stretch\" them, but they always return to the same size.  I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.I tried the new Bose.  They fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise, but of course they are much more expensive.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ouch- but they sound nice", "unixReviewTime": 1101427200, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2004"}
