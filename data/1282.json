At the touch of a button, you can connect it to your PC and transfer all of its information (which also means you can input information to your palm  from your PC). There's a myriad of freeware available on the net that will  enhance the performance of the Palm IIIx. The screen is great for viewing.  4MB is more than you'll ever need (I have many programs loaded, and  thousands of phone numbers and appointments, and I only use 1.3 MB).The  great advantage of the Palm IIIx is that it uses batteries (versus the Palm  V and Vx, which are rechargeable), which means you don't have to carry your  cradle when you travel, and you can get batteries for it anywhere! Small,  lightweight, highly efficient. I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful, great value!", "unixReviewTime": 948758400, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2000"}
