Westmoreland", "helpful": [30, 31], "reviewtext": "Having used a paper Daytimer for years, I was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing.  Boy, have I been converted!  The Palm IIIx (my second Palm - the first being a III) is, for  me, a great value.It has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive note-taking, yellow page totin' workaholic among us.  (I  download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all.  I also keep about 700 phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times)  It has the  improved screen and processor versus the III.  And it has the benefit of  the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices  apart from Windows CE (and other) devices.I like the fold-over cover  both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look :) and feel.  The backlight takes a little getting used to.  It is not useful at all for  dim daylight use, but works just fine in dark situations.I really want  the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel, but I have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more (and  costs a lot less).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What wouldl I do without it?", "unixReviewTime": 953337600, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2000"}
