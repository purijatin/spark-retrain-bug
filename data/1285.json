I am more than satisfied with Palm products, and am currently looking into a Tungsten as an upgrade.  The Windows based palmtops are nice too, but they cannot beat the Palm's reliability and ease of use.  The software is also very stable and easy to use.  This is the only device of its kind I own that has never lost data or become corrupted.  Reliability goes a long way with me, so I give it 5 stars!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 Years and Going Strong!", "unixReviewTime": 1110844800, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2005"}
