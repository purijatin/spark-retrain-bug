I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem.  Mine didn't do this right away.  It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it.  Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't.  When its there, the streaking  (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the  screen totally unreadable.  Five minutes later, all can be fine.  PDA need  to be dependable.  Mine isn't always.  Before I started reading other  reviews, I thought mine was just broken.  I was considering buying another  but not if by luck, I get another &quot;streaker&quot;.  Even though I like  the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great  software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one.  Probably  wouldn't go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in  advance.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good but BEWARE the streaks", "unixReviewTime": 947030400, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2000"}
