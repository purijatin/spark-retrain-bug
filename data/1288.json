Originally, my wife ordered a Handspring Visor for my birthday.  Six weeks later, with no indication of when (if ever) the Visor would be shipping, she cancelled it and ordered the Palm  IIIx for me instead.  I've been playing endless with it since.I find,  for example, it's easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car;  hence, car rides can be much more productive.Then I found out about  downloading games from the Internet.  I've been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days (&quot;Rogue&quot;).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love it so much I'm neglecting my laptop!", "unixReviewTime": 943315200, "reviewTime": "11 23, 1999"}
