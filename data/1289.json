I've only purchased it since DVD's are entering the Rental market.  With 500 lines of resolution (Using the S-video connector cable), this system has the same  picture quality of any current DVD player (dont be fooled!), The sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround.  Great Buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply a wonderful unit and a great buy!", "unixReviewTime": 936921600, "reviewTime": "09 10, 1999"}
