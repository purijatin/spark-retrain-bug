I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Mount for Corners", "unixReviewTime": 1390953600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014"}
