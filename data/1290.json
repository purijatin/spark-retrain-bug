Most of the time this player works fine. But sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen. You can sometimes just tap the machine and it  comes back on, other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray  just to get rid of the blue screen. Luckily this doesn't happen that often.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player, go for it, but  if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the  scale.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good dvd player, most of the time.", "unixReviewTime": 958003200, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2000"}
