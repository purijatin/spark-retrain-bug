Anderson", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewtext": "I've had the displeasure of owning two RCA brand DVD players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking.  I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy).  The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor).  My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a \"NO DISC\" message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason.  Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products.  I've learned my lesson with RCA and will specifically avoid their products in the future.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "DO NOT BUY!", "unixReviewTime": 995846400, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2001"}
