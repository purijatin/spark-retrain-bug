I've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly.  I get rental DVD's (more scratched - usually &quot;more  difficult to play&quot;) about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of  renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem.Overall, I think there's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player -  like cd players, they're one and the same unless you're really descriminate  about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Loved it so much I bought another", "unixReviewTime": 958521600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2000"}
