However, I decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad I did. Great picture, great sound! Plenty of features. I  have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the  DVD's I've purchased. This is one great little machine for the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Entry-level DVD Player at an Affordable Price", "unixReviewTime": 940723200, "reviewTime": "10 24, 1999"}
