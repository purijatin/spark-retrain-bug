It's capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive, which happens far too often with my temperamental (fastidious?) machine.  I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions, as this model requires extra deep shelves.  Finally, its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with  Philips, Magnavox, or Sylvania monitors.  (It may be important to remember that  a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in &quot;auxilliary mode,&quot; which is hidden away somewhere in my set's menu choices and virtually inaccessible.)  In short, the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by Sony, Panasonic, and other Japanese manufacturers.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Worrisome machine.", "unixReviewTime": 985564800, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2001"}
