Believe it or not, it was hard to find a radio with those qualities.  Modern radios are teeny-tiny, and have tons of &quot;features&quot;.  I needed this radio for someone who was visually impaired, had severe arthritis, and was well beyond the age of dealing with multi-functional gadgets.  Fortunately (?) GE is still in the business of making things &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.To me, the GE brand has always meant &quot;cheaply made&quot;.  To be fair, it once meant superior quality and cutting-edge innovation, but GE along with General Motors and a few other &quot;Super Conglomerates&quot;, took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century. Now they're madly playing catch-up, and this little radio, even though it's a throwback, is the first sign I've seen that they're making progress.It's a simple am/fm radio.  It's a little too bulky, has very nice monoraural sound, and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers.  Still, it's just what I needed, and it's the first GE product I've intentionally purchased in over thirty years.  Either my standards are coming down, or they're actually improving their quality.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I'm not really a snob", "unixReviewTime": 1082332800, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2004"}
