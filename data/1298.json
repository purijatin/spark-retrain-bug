I figured with a smaller unit, I would save space and not have a very good sound. I was wrong about this unit. I was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit. 2 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well. I highly recommend this product. It is a good price, small, and has a great sound.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Little radio, a lot of sound", "unixReviewTime": 1173312000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2007"}
