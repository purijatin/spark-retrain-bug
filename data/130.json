If you don't use the swivel feature frequently or don't place it where it may be bumped it will do the job. I prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have TWO arms extending from a longer wall bracket. These more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices. Also look for a feature which allows the TV Bracket (and TV) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It's OK", "unixReviewTime": 1326412800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2012"}
