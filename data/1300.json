I was pleasantly surprised to  discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words.  I  also like the fact that it has a solid, metal antenna instead of one of  those thin, whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our  household (my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those  antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the  living room for the 2000 Antenna Olympics).  Another nice feature is the  little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great little radio!", "unixReviewTime": 968544000, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2000"}
