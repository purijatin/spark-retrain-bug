Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house.  Now, I can get it very strong and clear.  The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off.  Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem.  It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels.  It's pretty lightweight plastic.  But, the only reason I got it was to receive this one station, and it does that job well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good reception for weak AM stations", "unixReviewTime": 1167868800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2007"}
