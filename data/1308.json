We live in a small town and have trouble receiving AM stations from the city on normal radios.  With the Superadio, there's no problem.  The tuner is sensitive and easy to use, the speaker sounds good, and the dials are tough.  I think this radio is a perfect part of anyone's emergency kit.  You'd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area.  So far I've used mostly the batteries for power and they're lasting nicely (the product instructions say they'll last for 460 hours of on time).  Do yourself a favor and buy this radio, it's a fun toy and a useful tool.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything you've heard is true.", "unixReviewTime": 1002499200, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2001"}
