The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line, and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years, inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made (I was part of some of these types of discussions as well), but when I was looking for a good portable radio, this version was high on the list.  We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound.  One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out, but that's why we have Amazon, right?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A bit  of history", "unixReviewTime": 1050278400, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2003"}
