The Superadio III does exactly that!  The AM is so potent it's like having AM shortwave - so MANY stations can be found - all over the USA.  The first night I ran it through it's capabilities, from NC we were clear receptioned in Chicago, Miss, Cleveland, NY, and other places that didn't identify.  Great trip.  And the FM reception is exceptional too and the sound is clear, rich and full.Yes, it's on the bulky side, not many bells and whistles, but for the price, it's a real champ.  Trying to convince my wife to get another one.  When it was suggested she could use that one for outside; battle won.  Great radio!P.S. If your battery compartment clips on your super Superadio 111 don't all snap into place, and if you haven't thought of it yet, fold a small piece of paper and wedge it into the 'V' of the offending clip(s) and voil&agrave;, the compartment is closed tightly. Now it's a 5 star radio!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This Is It!", "unixReviewTime": 1168473600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2007"}
