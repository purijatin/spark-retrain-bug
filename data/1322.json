I'm not particularly wild about their redesign of the III's case (the II had a tremendous generic radio look to it), but the reception and audio quality is about the  same. As other reviewers have noted, the dial accuracy is poor, so you have  to &quot;learn&quot; each Superadio's setting, but once you learn where  stations are, they stay put.This is a superb radio, with surprisingly  good sound and excellent reception. I have one at work, one in the kitchen,  and one that I tote around (to the beach, to the driveway for carwashing,  to the b-ball court).  Versatile, solidly built and nice priced.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A classic!", "unixReviewTime": 958348800, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2000"}
