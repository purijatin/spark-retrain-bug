I have tried various combination shortwave/AM/FM radios  over the past few years and none had better than \"so-so\" sound on FM.  I'd read about this radio for many years and when I saw it on Amazon , figured it was worth a try.  I have been very pleasantly surprised!  The radio is very large, but has very large speakers that, combined with separate bass and treble controls, produce a very good quality sound.  The tuner section is highly sensitive, even on FM. After I loaded the six D cells into it, I have never even plugged it into the wall and it has been used daily for several hours for many months now. The build quality is a little cheesy, but if it weren't it would weigh as much as an anchor.  If you want good quality audio and reception at a very reasonable price and don't mind a large portable, this is a winner.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Value!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1003536000, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2001"}
