Solid sound quality, excellent AM receptivity (but only average FM receptivity).But it wasn't very hardy.  I took it camping once, and it was never the same after that.  It took several minutes to \"warm up\" after you turned it on, and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that.  And scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume.  I figure the radio didn't like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great radio, but don't take it outside", "unixReviewTime": 1155513600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2006"}
