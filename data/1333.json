I looked long and hard - Crane was ok, but I already had a Grundig PE 400 and wanted a radio for primarily AM reception (I like to DX from time to time) GE Superradio III does the trick, and I got it from Amazon for 39.00!! Target doesn't even carry it anymore, and Sears does for $70. What a ripoff!! Thanks to Amazon - they paid for the shipping (Got it before Christmas) and came in tight packaging with no problems whatsoever. This is the best radio in the business, I get KGO from SF like a local LA station at night - no static like my other units. Thanks. JG", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THIS IS THE RADIO TO BUY!! FYI - CC RADIO CATALOG HAS THIS FOR SALE TOO!!", "unixReviewTime": 1136678400, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2006"}
