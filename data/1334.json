Long battery life (6 D cells), superb AM sound that can be made even better on strong signals by switching it to &quot;wide&quot; bandwidth mode, and sensitivity that allows me to listen to NY and NJ AM stations during the day at my home in MD, using just the Superadio's built-in antenna.The only way it could be better would be to have a digital frequency display, but the analog &quot;dial&quot; is OK enough once you get used to it.The FM section is no slouch, either. Mine picks up a distant high-school station without even extending the antenna. And, the Superadio is also one of only two radios I've ever been able to use at home (near a busy tower) with no front end overload problems at all. (The other radio is a discontinued model that cost 2.5 times as much--in 1970 dollars--as the Superadio does now.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best radio I have ever owned.", "unixReviewTime": 996624000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2001"}
