Edelman", "helpful": [124, 126], "reviewtext": "It's big, it's bulky, and you can't carry it while you're roller blading, but the GE Superradio has the best AM and FM reception of just about ANY  portable radio on the market, short of a $500 Lowe. It's especially valued  for its sensitive AM reception (it's a favorite of AM broadcast band  &quot;DXers&quot; chasing distant stations) but the FM reception is nearly  as good. Spend some time listening to it in the evening and you'llbe amazed  how many AM stations are out there that you never suspected existed.After I loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house, he ran out  and bought one; his old job site radio just couldn't get his favorite  stations. He listens to it at home now, too. For the money there's just  nothing else that even comes close.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Portable Radio Made", "unixReviewTime": 965865600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2000"}
