It's hard to miss almost anywhere you put it, and probably too big to look OK on your desk.But the sound is huge and there is much less AM buzzing (pretty much none!)than I've experienced with the half-dozen other radios I've tried in my house over the years.I listen to just two AM stations, so tuning has not been a problem for me.The Superadio has a plug coiled out of the way in the battery compartment, so you have it if you need it. And since this is no Walkman, you may find yourself able to plug it in more often than you might expect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bigger than I expected, and great AM reception", "unixReviewTime": 1105574400, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2005"}
