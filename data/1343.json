I took off 1 star  because on fm I cant get 103 cleary but my grundig can get it better. Is it because the antena is too small? Or is it that I need to modify it??? The am reception is good. The sound is better than the grundig s350!!! Over all the radio is good.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good", "unixReviewTime": 1134432000, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2005"}
