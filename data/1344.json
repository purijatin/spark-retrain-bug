Very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performance.Sound is top rate.Dial calibration is poor but you can  get used to it.It's exactly as sensitive as the CCRadio at $160 with  much better sound than the CCRadio.  Lacks only the CCRadio's digital  tuning.  Sorry, Art Bell.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great long-distance daytime AM Radio, great audio", "unixReviewTime": 948758400, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2000"}
