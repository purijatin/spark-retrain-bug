We went through a half dozen radios attempting to find something that could grab a specific PBS station we enjoyed most, KQED from San Francisco.Can you imagine hearing Garrison Keillor over a crystal set?Things changed for the better only after we followed a recommendation in Amazon to this GE portable.Somehow, I think it is a tuner knob that is a precise as a laser knife and a tuning band that seems a foot and a half wide, we can nail the signal.  After that it is a matter of playing with AFC, bass, treble and a view other variables to pull in a signal that is not only there but pretty good.The only real drawbacks come from sun spots: when they flaired we could could hear them.  And oh, for a while we heard a neighbor use her cordless phone, which was odd and entertaining for a couple of Saturdays until we figured it out and knocked on some doors.The only circumstance that changed our way of life with  the GE came with internet radio.When the internet has gone down (it has), out comes the GE.  If you live without cable or the internet in some fringe reception hell as did we, get this radio.Good listening.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "When Paradise Gets Bad Reception", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2014"}
