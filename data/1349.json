The best is the tuned RF stage that pulls in distance stations with ease.  Second is the dual power feature: a line cord comes built in, and in battery mode, it takes 6 \"D\" cells so they last a very long time.  Third, Two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume.  It's hard to believe you can buy this for under $50.00! This is a great radio and I will be buying more forChristmas presents.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They got it right!", "unixReviewTime": 1084924800, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2004"}
