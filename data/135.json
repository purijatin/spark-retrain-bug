In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42&#34; television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good tv mount", "unixReviewTime": 1383523200, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2013"}
