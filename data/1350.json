You can adjust the bass &amp; treble to your liking!  I have the first one I purchased many years ago, it still works perfectly!!  I have recently purchased an additional one, it is just as good as the original.  It is easy to bring in stations on this radio that don't come in clearly on other radios.  This is a solid, sturdy radio, like the ones from years ago.  The radio has a full, rich warm sound, from its large speaker. It is hard to believe a radio so compact can sound so big and wonderful!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best radio ever!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1076112000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2004"}
