BUT, the radio that I received is bad. Intermittently, the volume goes down to nothing..I can hear it only humming..A one year warranty comes with it and I bought mine about two months ago.. It's going back but I'm afraid that since the problem is intermittent, it won't be fixed.. Been there, done that..Never the less, it's a great radio as far as reception..Guess what? I bought another one today.. One for work, one for home use.. I'm sure I'll have to do without the original for a while it's being repaired though.I rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception (design) yet very low for quality of the build.. Never-the-less, they do have a year warranty unlike most consumer products which generally are 90 days..Keep the reciept.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fine reception, poor quality..", "unixReviewTime": 1003017600, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2001"}
