It's all great.It is certainly not \"feature rich\" but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio?  More feature would just get in my way.TIP: The radio has a ground screw on the back which I'm guessing most people don't use. After hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna, I noticed that what really helped AM DX reception was the ground!I bought a grounding rod from Radio Shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system. (I pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house.) That REALLY helped! So much so, that I removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've owned two for fifteen years -- fantastic", "unixReviewTime": 1196380800, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2007"}
