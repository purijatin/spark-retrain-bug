These stylus' are much more rugged, and reliable and are built to last.  You should definately replace Mr. Default Stylus.  The reason being that these new Metal stylus' will improve your grafitti skills 10-fold!  Another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip.  (Much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device)  Pick up these stylus' if you haven't already, they are really good!  Certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price.  Plus you get 3 of them in case you ever lose one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much better then the default stylus", "unixReviewTime": 972259200, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2000"}
