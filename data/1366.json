Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three)  have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more  like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically  easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the  screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for  the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a  stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the  plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my  girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly  go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one,  buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You don't know how much you need them until you lose them.", "unixReviewTime": 962928000, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2000"}
