Simply put, this stylus three-pack is a bargain, and should be the first accessory item you add to a Palm IIIxe purchase. These have a metal barrel that makes it feel like a real writing instrument and not a toy.Put one in your IIIxe, one in your briefcase or purse, and maybe one in your car, and you'll always be covered. Read the other reviews here and you'll see that most of the owners agree - get this and you won't be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Own a Palm IIIxe?
