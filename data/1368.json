These metal styli don't exhibit that problem. The extra weight also &quot;feels better&quot; in a way I can't describe otherwise. (It's not THAT much heavier, but it does feel more comfortable in your hand.) The best feature, though, is that unscrewing the top gets you to a built-in reset tool. Unfortunately, especially with third-party software, you WILL need to reset your Palm on occasion, and having a handy reset tool saves on batteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mandatory for Palm III's", "unixReviewTime": 985046400, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2001"}
