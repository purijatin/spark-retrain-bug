Bainbridge \"www.professorbainbridg...", "helpful": [20, 22], "reviewtext": "If you have a Palm, you're going to lose the stylus. If you're like me,  you're going to lose one about every four months. So you're going to need  replacements. If you haven't lost your original stylus yet, wait--you will.  Or, better yet, toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement  stylii. The cheap metal stylus that comes with the Palm III is hard to use  because it is too light. (I have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the  original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard I ended up  gripping the stylus.) These replacement stylii are a heavier metal, which  is easier to hold and considerably more accurate. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A better stylus at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 968112000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2000"}
