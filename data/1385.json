Charme", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that I used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls. When I got rid of that line, I bought this wireless phone jack so that I could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wires.The product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs, but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room, which is in another part of the house.This unit has enabled me to use my phone/fax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems.  Making phone calls is a different story. Although there is always some \"noise\" on the line, sometimes it is so minimal that I can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation. But other times the \"noise\" is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someone.Bottom line: faxing is always possible, but voice conversations sometimes are not. You need to decide what your priorities are before you buy this.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Average product", "unixReviewTime": 1242604800, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2009"}
