They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference. You have to try them and see what works for you.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worthless, picks up a lot of noise from household appliances.", "unixReviewTime": 1194480000, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2007"}
