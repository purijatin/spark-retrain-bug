White", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This product does not work with my base unit at all, even though they are both the same brand.  Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However, is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don't work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I've read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Be careful!", "unixReviewTime": 1235433600, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2009"}
