I tried  a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great replacement for original power cable", "unixReviewTime": 1394323200, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2014"}
