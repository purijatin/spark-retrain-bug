I looked at both this Uniden headset and  the AT&amp;T one that is also sold on Amazon.  Even though I read the  reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and  bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet.  I used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it.  It was comfortable on my head, easy to  adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was  talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more  money for the AT&amp;T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom  with everyone else.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Don't make my mistake", "unixReviewTime": 965865600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2000"}
