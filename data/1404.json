Yankura \"yanko\"", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewtext": "I purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system.  The only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home.  I used it a few time when I work on my computer and need help.  Sound quality is fine.  If I had to do over, I might have looked into a wireless. Don't get me wrong, it works fine. It's that I don't really need it with my speaker phones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nothing special", "unixReviewTime": 1171324800, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2007"}
