I only bought this thing to get a credit on my DISH network bill. (They don't tell you they charge per month if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, just that you get a credit each month if you do.) For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year. So, since I didn't have any phone lines anywhere near by, this thing works just fine for what I need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Needed for DISH network", "unixReviewTime": 1233792000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2009"}
