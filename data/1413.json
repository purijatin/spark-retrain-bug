This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said \"you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you\" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It kind-of sucks really", "unixReviewTime": 963792000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2000"}
