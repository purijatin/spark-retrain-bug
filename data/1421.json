Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Works OK.  2.5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1128902400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2005"}
