Freeman Jr.", "helpful": [121, 127], "reviewtext": "I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.  Glad I wasn't in the middle of 40,000 acres. You can't zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location. Actually to do  so but you have to set a scale of .1 or .2 and Pan &amp; Scan to it. If is  is 50 miles away, you can imagine how long that could take.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "GPS 315 good but has big problems", "unixReviewTime": 948153600, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2000"}
