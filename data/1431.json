They totally scratch the CD.The \"Step 1: Scratch Removal\" is not scratch removal at all. It is supposed to sit for 5 minutes, then you wipe it. I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply \"Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer\". This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.The only good thing that I use the \"Scratch Remover\" for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.Last Word:I hate Maxell.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This won't fix the Cd's, it will ruin them", "unixReviewTime": 1121817600, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2005"}
