But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T.
