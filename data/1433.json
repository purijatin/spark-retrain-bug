It did take a couple applications, but the sections where the DVD would stop and shut off, now play continuously through.  Make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works", "unixReviewTime": 1374105600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2013"}
