I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "It doesn't work and adds scratches", "unixReviewTime": 1260316800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2009"}
