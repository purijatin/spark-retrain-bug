I don't think the stewardesses were happy that we didn't have to buy headphones though... but, they worked well and we were able to hear the in-flight movie and the movies on our portable DVD players. 4 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home. However, two pair are still functioning quite well. Saw these at this reduced price and I just bought 5 more pair for some travelling this Summer. I don't get into all the techie stuff that others do... I just say if it works well, great...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worked for me...", "unixReviewTime": 1367884800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2013"}
