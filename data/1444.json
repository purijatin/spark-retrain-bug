They offer pretty decent noise cancelling, for cutting the lawn. Also, they come in handy for when I'm at workCounting beats and mixing, these headphones with the noise reduction, make it so much better to dial in.As everyday headphones the sound and it's delicate wired nature, may turn some people off.They are somewhat comfortable, battery life is great, and comes with a carrying bad. No quarter inch adapter,not too many people need it anymore.All in all, a bit delicate, wires can become weak at junctions.They do what I want them to do, so I buy a couple and keep a pair as backup for gig.I own Grado, too bright, Beyerdynamic, my favorite set, and briefly had Bose, way too pricey, and nowhere near neutral in sound.If they were more durable, I would rate them higher.If you're careful with them and want cheap noise cancelling headphones, they are worth it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice for lawn cutting.", "unixReviewTime": 1371254400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2013"}
