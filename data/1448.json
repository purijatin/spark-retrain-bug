Only one complaint, as others have mentioned, problems with the power jack. Within a month, it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging. Took it back to the store I got it, and they gave me a brand new one one the spot. But, several months later, the new one had the same problem. Brought it back again. This time I had to wait 2 weeks to get it repaired. Two months later, same problem. Another 2 week repair. I'm striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in, but heck, it's a laptop! Anyway, if it happens a fourth time, my warranty says they have to give me a new one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I love it, but that power jack has got to go", "unixReviewTime": 1136419200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2006"}
