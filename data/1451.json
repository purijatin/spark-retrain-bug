They are comfortable & I havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time.The battery life is very good, the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.Im going to upgrade to the NC IV for home & keep my NC II for in the car.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "These have worked great for several years...", "unixReviewTime": 1230768000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2009"}
