Fortunately, no one spent a lot of money on them, because they really seem cheap to me. The construction is flimsy, and they're bulky. Maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in, as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that. It offers no protection to the headphones at all.I just can't see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carry-on space. I don't see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get: these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on, the sound is even worse. It's flat and lifeless.I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down super-compactly into a nicely-designed case and even cost a few bucks less.I don't know about the expensive noise-cancellation headphones, but I would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Cheap Headphones, there are much better options for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1199145600, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2008"}
