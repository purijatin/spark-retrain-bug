I don't even have a tape player anymore.Both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases.  Thought I would give both a try and see which I liked better.I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.I have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms, put on walls.  Fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didn't waste batteries. :P", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hey you need a mix tape baby?", "unixReviewTime": 1341619200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2012"}
