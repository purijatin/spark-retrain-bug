They were getting more expensive each and every year.  Luckily I thought about looking here.  I found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago.  It literally brought back childhood memories, well not really, but it was very inexpensive.  I still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves.  And when they did, the prices were high.  I highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on Amazon, they have many different brands to chose from.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm glad I looked here for cassettes, found a deal here.", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2013"}
