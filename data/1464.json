When I played it back, it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles. I have used three or four of them without a hitch, but then I generally do rely on Maxell for my taping needs so I was not surprised. I will buy more again when I need more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Since they work beautifully, I cannot give them less than five stars", "unixReviewTime": 1373673600, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2013"}
