Although people now use CD's, I give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so I don't have to deal with burning CD's. Buying online is less expensive and easier to find.

Usually one Walgreen's that I know of has them but its hit or miss.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I use these for business", "unixReviewTime": 1336348800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2012"}
