This is the best price I've seen on good normal bias tapes - the chrome (high bias, Type II) are just too pricey - but these sound just fine for all my music, whether rock, jazz, country or classical.  Getcha some before the Type I prices get stupid, too.  And enjoy some George Jones singing along with a Beethoven tune while David Sanborn blows his sax and Jimmy Page picks his axe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Makin' tapes again.", "unixReviewTime": 1356652800, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2012"}
