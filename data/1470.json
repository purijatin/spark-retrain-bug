Tapes wear out over time so I buy them new tapes once a year or so.  These tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my Mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year.  I have never gotten a \"bad\" tape or had tapes break.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yes, some folks do still have VHS recorders!
