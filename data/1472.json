I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.Also-this vendor appears to be a fine one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Maxell 4-pk vhs tapes", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600, "reviewTime": "02 29, 2012"}
