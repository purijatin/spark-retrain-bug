Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me.  Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive.  After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting.  Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Bargain...", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2012"}
