I've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine.  No problems so far.  Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I haven't been using them long, and I haven't done much re-recording, which is something else I do.  I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value", "unixReviewTime": 1317427200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2011"}
