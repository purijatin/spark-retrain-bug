This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Maxell T160 8 hrs", "unixReviewTime": 1350086400, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2012"}
