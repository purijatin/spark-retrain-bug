Great look to it and could not be more pleased.  I live in the absolute boondocks, 88 miles from the nearest WalMart, 50 miles from even a McDonalds burger stand.  I absolutely count on amazon.com to order things I need, they are nicely delivered by mail, UPS or FedEx and spare me the need to travel long expensive miles for some of the simplest things.  AMAZON.COM ROCKS!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great", "unixReviewTime": 1307491200, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2011"}
