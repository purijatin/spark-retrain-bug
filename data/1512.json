It is very hard to find VHS in retail stores, but I am glad these tapes can be found here at Amazon and other websites as well.  These can record up to 8 hours.  I have a VHS tape eraser, which is a giant magnet, so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program.  Very durable.  Can be reused over and over again, best when you erase with the tape eraser, otherwise you will see your old program under your new program.  I recommend this product.  I rate this a 5 star.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}
