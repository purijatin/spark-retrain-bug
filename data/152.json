It lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere I set in my living room. This unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else I've bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My new tv wall mount", "unixReviewTime": 1364428800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2013"}
