Their range is excellent - I have listened to music for 3-4 hours about 100 feet from the base. They are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easily.Reality 2 - The challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished. The battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better. Also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal. Additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength, if you don't have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance suffers.Since I am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal, but others (like my wife) will find it a hassle.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A solid product but could have been better", "unixReviewTime": 1010707200, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2002"}
