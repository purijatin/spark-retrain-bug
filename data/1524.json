When I dropped them a day after getting them home, the right earpiece shattered, revealing the inside of a very cheap product. .... The description doesn't tell you that you have to tune the transmitter, then tune the headset until the signals coincide. That takes a little doing to get it right, and I find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours. I have to re-tune the base and the headset each time they lose each other. It also has an annoying whine most of the time also. Since last XMas, it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores, which is a shame because it is so bad.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not a good product", "unixReviewTime": 991612800, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2001"}
