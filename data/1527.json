Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work.  It did!  The cleaner is extremely easy to use.  You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.  After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too.  I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila!  It was working again!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm shocked it worked", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013"}
