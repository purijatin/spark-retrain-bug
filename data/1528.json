I orderd this lens cleaner and the transformation was instant, plays all my games w no freeze. I also hav a few high end DVD units, one an expensive Samsung DVD recorder that stopped recording and playing discs and a Toshiba upconversion DVD player that stopped reconizing and playing discs. I popped the lens cleaner in and their both working beautiful now, I was going to throw them out. A great product, and I can use it over and over if I hav any other devices that stop reading and playing discs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I payed under $3", "unixReviewTime": 1281657600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2010"}
