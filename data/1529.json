I had to write a review on such a great product.  It is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road.  Your television, cd player, receiver, computer, etc.  These are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget.I live in a highrise apartment right in downtown Boston and there is much dust.  When a cd player starts acting up you don't know what's going on at first.  If its dead, its dead.  But if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do?  Is it the player itself?  First you clean the cds.  Maybe its a simple problem.  Well, my cd player was having a field day at the time - cds jumping and skipping all over.  I purchased this product, used it correctly and voila - the cd player worked perfectly.  All the problems cleared up.  Now, whenever it starts to skip I know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean.Bottom line, this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection.  I have had it 4 years and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this product.  Finally, something that actually does what it says it does.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Definitely works - a must have", "unixReviewTime": 1224374400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2008"}
