It's not that old, but here in West Texas, we get a lot of dust. My console pretty much stopped reading discs. I would have to eject a disc, and put it back in at least 10 times before it would read it. I ordered this based on the reviews. I figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away, since it didn't read my games. So I put it in, it would spin up, and then would say no disc. This only happened once! The next time I ran it, it read the disc! To be safe, I ran the disc 3 times. I put in a game it would not read, and it read it on the first try! I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fixed my 360!", "unixReviewTime": 1267401600, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2010"}
