It's a great CD player and radio, with all of the features I wanted.  (It looks and functions like the Bose model...but I hate Bose with such a passion, I would've paid more to NOT buy their product.)The BA unit kept returning an error message, \"CD ?\"  after one was inserted.  This cleaner, used one time, fixed the problem.  Problem hasn't occurred again, in more than a year.I was hesitant to try it....some reviews and advice said it could ruin the system.  But I was going to not use the system anyway....so I took a chance.  Turned out to be a good decision, but I don't know enough about WHY it works to say it would be safe for every unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fixed my Boston Acoustics player perfectly!", "unixReviewTime": 1257897600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2009"}
