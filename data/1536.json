It's ingeneous approach does seem clever though. Consumers buy this product when their CD player starts skipping. I did too. If you're  lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser, you're in luck. One cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem. Good luck, it's definitely worth a try.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It cleans the laser.
