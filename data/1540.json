I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brought my skippy CD player back to life", "unixReviewTime": 1147478400, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2006"}
