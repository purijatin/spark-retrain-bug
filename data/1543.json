It took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car CD player. I was shocked that it worked so fast ! Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3, then after the music on the cleaning disk stops, remove the disk and your done. Unless they came out with a better product, I don't know why they stopped selling this one !", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Allsop CD Laser-Lens Cleaner", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"}
