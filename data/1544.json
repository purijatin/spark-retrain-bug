CD's were skipping and others wouldn't play at all. Thought maybe it may need a \"clean up.\"  WOW! Put this in the CD player...ran it twice. That's all it took. And to think, I was ready to pay to have a new one installed. Have to agree with others...don't buy a new CD player before trying this. Besides, the music on the CD isn't so bad either...yes...there's music on the CD cleaner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Glad I Bought It!", "unixReviewTime": 1208563200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2008"}
