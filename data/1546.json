Then I decided to try the Allsop CD laser-lens cleaner. It cured my problem in less than 5 minutes. So, if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution. But, don't expect it to cure mechanical or other problems. If your CD drive is giving you problems, this is worth a try. If it doesn't work you are not out much and you know the problem isn't dirt on the lens. My only complaint is that it is not clear when it is through cleaning, so I cleaned the lens 3 times before I was convinced it was done.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple and Effective", "unixReviewTime": 1168300800, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2007"}
