Hofer", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my DVDs so took a chance on these and ordered them from Amazon. I don't know what they're made of but they work great. They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching. I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge. For fingerprints, I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping. The nice thing about these is that they're re-usable until they get dirty.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Economical cleaning solution.", "unixReviewTime": 1321401600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2011"}
