But ended up trying this out because of it's cheap price and it's \"FastWipe\" title, but still a bit skeptical without any wet solution.I am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward. The discs are cleaned within a matter of 15 to 20 seconds for a thorough job. I find myself having fun wiping the entire collection of CDs, DVDs, and blu-ray discs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No kidding that it is fast!", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}
