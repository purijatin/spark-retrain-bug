They are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good. I was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that I had so in fact I ended up just buying a new DVD of the same recording...but its a good product for maintenance. I guess the lesson I learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used. Also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old LP recording..so I did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but not Excellent wipes", "unixReviewTime": 1350777600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2012"}
