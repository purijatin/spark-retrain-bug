They do work but don't expect miracles for nicked or the surface film damaged DVD's that need to be tossed.  Recommend this product for a fast and time saving cleanup of your DVD or CD, I am definitely going to order another pack before I run out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "DVD clean them up", "unixReviewTime": 1306800000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011"}
