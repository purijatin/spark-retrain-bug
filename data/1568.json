I ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them...so I was totally horrified by this information. I currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician. No problem with scratches but more expensive.I RETURNED this product because I was afraid as the package warns that I could scratch my discs. I would not have ordered if anyone had mentioned this information on the website so I could evaluate the risks and make a wise buying decision.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "WARNING: WEBSITE DESCRIPTION INCOMPLETE: You have to receive this product", "unixReviewTime": 1370304000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2013"}
