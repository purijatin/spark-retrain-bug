I decided to try these, not expecting much.  Surprise, they work great!  I had purchased some discs with excessive fingerprints and the like, these cleaned the discs right up.  As noted in the item description some small scratches or scuffing can be caused by the wipes, not a major problem if care is taken. I will definitely buy again when my supply is gone!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Happy Surprise!", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"}
