I bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them. I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside. I truly think they are amazing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazingly good", "unixReviewTime": 1349308800, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2012"}
