Typically, I clean them by \"breathing\" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a \"breath\" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.  Four stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A better CD/DVD cleaner than my T-shirts ... :-)", "unixReviewTime": 1319241600, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2011"}
