They are  8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exactly what I expected - 8\" velcro ties", "unixReviewTime": 1208822400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2008"}
