They are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly(Picture sizing out Spagetti for two people big). If you need it for a few small wires it won't work as well. These are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material. I see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system, or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Cable ties for big wires. Just know they won't work well on smaller applications.", "unixReviewTime": 1359417600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2013"}
