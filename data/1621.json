They are mostly loop, and towards the end there is a 1&#34; piece of loop sewn on.  I found this to be rather stiff and didn't readily bend to conform to the cables I was wrapping.  8&#34; is a nice length, but much longer than what I needed, so I ended up wrapping around a few times before trying to close it.  You could probably cut an end off, but I like longer ties, as it seems I'm constantly moving things around and I get very frustrated when I find something a few inches short.  If the 1&#34; hook part were not as stiff I'd give it the extra star.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Help for organizing those cables!", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}
