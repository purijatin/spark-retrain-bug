I tried some other brands and was more of a &#34;pain&#34; than help. Seen this at Amazon and it couldn't work better. Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed. Get price too even if it is an &#34;Add-On Item&#34;. Thanks : )", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Wire Wraps !", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2014"}
