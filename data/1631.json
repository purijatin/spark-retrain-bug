In that aspect these little things are great!There isn't much to say about a cable tie, but for that extra nudge to get free shipping, these are a must!Pros-inexpensive bump to get free shipping-velcro, and multi colored-no more crazy wires!Cons-tag fell off of one, but for under 3 bucks, not that big a deal-too short for anything other than cables, again not a real con but it would be great to see a similar product with more length.I bought 3 packs of these so far and as long as I still have cables, I will slowly get more with each Amazon purchase :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "That little extra to get free shipping", "unixReviewTime": 1211328000, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2008"}
