Otherwise I just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together, and now it's &#34;permanently&#34; tethered to one end.I guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available. What if you want to have only one colour for your cables, so that they don't end up being in your partner's case?  And I suppose the colours could've been brighter.But they do look nice, and there's plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Colourful, Effective Cable Ties", "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2013"}
