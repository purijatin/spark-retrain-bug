Mason \"rm1\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I've used these velcro straps, and similar velcro straps from other manufacturers, for several years now to secure cables for computer systems, networking systems, and entertainment systems in my home.  Before I discovered the velcro cable ties, I was using the plastic cable ties where you feed one end through a hole in the other end, pull until tight, and cut off the \"tail\".  But the thing I didn't like about the plastic cable ties is they can't be re-used and you have to cut them to remove them.  That's not a problem if you rarely mess with your equipment and cables, but in my case I seem to be upgrading something, moving something, repairing something, or throwing something away on a regular basis.  That meant I was regularly cutting a bunch of plastic cable ties, getting new ones, and re-tieing everything, which I sort of began to dread and then loath.  The velcro cable ties make it alot easier.There's is a somewhat peculiar skill involved in learning how to wrap these things around a bundle of cables and getting them tight, but once you figure it out, it's very simple and you can get them very tight if you want.  I've never had one come lose on its own, so they're also very reliable.  Basically I'd recommend this type of cable tie to anyone, and this particular product from Belkin has worked well for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I like these things", "unixReviewTime": 1289952000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2010"}
