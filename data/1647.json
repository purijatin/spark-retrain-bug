These are fine, but because they're only grippy on about an inch at the end, they really only work well on larger cables, like power cords and ethernet cables, etc.  I wanted them to wrap up all the little headphone and micro usb cables that I have cluttering my backpack.  And these definitely are not good for those size cables.  The colors are nice and will help you corral cables at your desk.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not as versatile as I'd hoped", "unixReviewTime": 1386720000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2013"}
