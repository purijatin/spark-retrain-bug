My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25\" from one side of the TV to the other ~16\") but for the price I can live with that.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Solid", "unixReviewTime": 1301356800, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2011"}
