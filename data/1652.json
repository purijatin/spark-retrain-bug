With these, you're basically paying for the little Belkin label that is sewn on. Just do an Amazon search for Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties.I don't recommend this product unless you absolutely only need 5 of them and want a brand name sewn on. They did work great but just not worth it to me compared to other options on Amazon.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Paying for a brand name", "unixReviewTime": 1391126400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2014"}
