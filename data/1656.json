I'm a guitarist and constantly having to wrap up chords and wires is annoying, especially when I try to take them out again only to find them a tangled mess! Ties are a perfect solution to this problem.  I wrap them up and stack them, then when I use them again they're still nicely placed.They look exactly as they do in the picture and function as well as you would think.  They are velcro and they hold very well.  I've had no problems with them yet.  I have been using them heavily (taking them off and putting them back on again) for months and haven't noticed much wear at all.  Sometimes the soft side of velcro frays and becomes useless over time but I have noticed almost none of this with the Belkin product.My only complaint would be that they are a little pricey for something that just holds stuff together but you definitely get what you pay for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Musicians", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012"}
