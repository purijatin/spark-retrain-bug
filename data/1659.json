When I priced around, this could not be beat.WILL NOT WORK WITH PARALLEL PORT ONLY COMPUTERS For the person that had a previous review, this is a cable that will only work on a printer that has a USB outlet.  This is not for printers that are strictly parallel port hook ups.ENDS FOR PRINTER AND COMPUTER DIFFERENT The USB end that is for the printer if you look in the photo, is the small end to the left.  It is only about 3/16&quot; wide and shorter than that.  The USB end for the computer is the big end to the right in the picture(about 3/8&quot; wide and shorter than that).MANY USB PRINTERS HAVE BOTH USB AND PARALLEL PORT CONNECTIONS Many USB printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well.  That is one of those huge flat type ones (roughly 2&quot; wide).This may sound simple for all you computer experts out there, but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that, it can get very confusing.Great buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best price around", "unixReviewTime": 992217600, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2001"}
