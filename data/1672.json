We have three in use.  Stocking up on a couple of extra at $4.95 each with free shipping is a good idea.  Quality printer cables will only increase in the future.  And the hits just keep on coming.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "INCREDIBLE BARGAIN", "unixReviewTime": 1243123200, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2009"}
