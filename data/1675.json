So I decided that if this cable is sufficiently well-made for Dell to offer it at its online store, then it's one I had to consider seriously as a USB cable linking my laptop computer with a brand new laser printer. Without question, I made the right decision. I am quite impressed with its excellent data transfer speed, superb workmanship and ease of use. It's an excellent product which I highly recommend to others seeking a well made high speed USB cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb USB Cable From Belkin", "unixReviewTime": 1180224000, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2007"}
