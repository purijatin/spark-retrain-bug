Ironically the cable is in the other room connected to a printer and still transmitting flawlessly. The moral is this is one well constructed cable and has returned my investment many times over.The connectors still mate and disengage smoothly like the first day I used it, and I am pretty sure that the beefy strain reliefs on each end are responsible for keeping the conductors inside the thick insulator intact. Indeed, as I inspected this cable before writing this review I marveled at the construction and materials. Both are first rate.This cable has traveled extensively - it was part of my travel kit when I was a road warrior consultant, and served me well in many US states as well as the Middle East on long and short assignments. Back to the strain reliefs: I would hastily pack and literally ball this cable up and throw it in my laptop case, yet the ends never damaged, which I attribute - in part - to the strain reliefs that kept crimps from breaking or fraying the conductors.Bottom line - this model is now USB 2.0 compatible and is built to last. In other words, you cannot go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Built to last", "unixReviewTime": 1371513600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2013"}
