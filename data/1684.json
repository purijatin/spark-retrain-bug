It is compatible with both USB 1.0 and 2.0 ports.  It is long enough to give great flexibility with arraging whatever it needs to be connected to.  The price is extremely good (even though amazon.com changes it every now and then) for this cable.  It is way more expensive in stores.  And getting a Belkin product for such a low price is excellent.  This is totally worth the money, and is a great buy if you need a USB cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceptional Quality at Low Price.", "unixReviewTime": 1102982400, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2004"}
