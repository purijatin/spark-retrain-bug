I wonder who that might be... hehe!  But getting back to the review ... As most of you know, a lot of USB devices don't come with a USB cable. The same thing applied when I purchased my new printer.  The clerk who sold me the printer suggested I purchase a USB cable along with my printer ... the asking price: $29.95 for a 8 foot long cable.  I told him &quot;NO&quot;.  Then purchased this cable on Amazon for $10.95 which included shipping.  The only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than I paid for the USB cable.  Oh well!  I bought some sushi with the 19 bucks that I saved!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't get ripped-off by computer stores!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1009411200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2001"}
