My webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that I use. Because of this I had to position it on a nearby flat surface, but the cord was too short for my needs.  With this Extension Cable I an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off, or having to constantly be repositioned.  The cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into USB connectors. Very useful device!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great accessory for webcan", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}
