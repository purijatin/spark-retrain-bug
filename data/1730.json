Lionel", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "My favorite uncle, now in his 90s, hangs on to an old 386 PC running DOS even after I bought him a new PC.  He uses both.  But he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves, including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old PC/AT style keyboard connector.  He wanted to use one of them with his new PC that has USB inputs only (I had previously bought him a PS/2 keyboard to USB adapter so he could use his *other* beloved, only slightly newer, keyboard.)  He called me asking if I could find a way to get his old \"big round plug\" keyboard with the new PC.This Belkin F2N017 adapter was just what he needed (combined with the aforementioned PS/2-USB adapter).  I had it sent to him and he called me a few days later, with delight, saying that the adapter worked perfectly, adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was using.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple but does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1313798400, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2011"}
