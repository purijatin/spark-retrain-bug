Low and behold, Belkin comes to the rescue.  The power cord was perfect for the old PC, but would be good for a new one as well.  It never hurts to have extras on hand when it comes of cords and cable for ANY computer.Great product from a reliable company.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A quality replacement", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}
