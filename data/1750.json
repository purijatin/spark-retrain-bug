Did a bit of looking around, all of the ones we found were $10 and up, for a power cord!Not only did I find this Belkin power cord on Amazon for much less, it's a name branded, UL listed, and just a higher quality cord.After getting it out of it's package it didn't retain it's bent/wadded up form either!Pros:Cheap!UL Listed (far too many companies are using cheaper certifications).Has a good memory, i.e. doesn't stay coiled up from being packaged.Cons:Doesn't magically lower my electric bill.
