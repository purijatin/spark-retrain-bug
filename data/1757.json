The fit on both ends was snug and secure. I didn't experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all. It plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally. PC powered up immediately on first try - which really doesn't need to be said...The bonus - it's really cheap!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good affordable cable. Snug/Secure fit.
