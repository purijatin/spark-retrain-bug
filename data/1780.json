An extension cord was needed. I have used Belkin products before and have always been satisfied so I didn't hesitate to order this online. I received it in only a few days and it worked perfectly. The plug ends fit snuggly and the picture on the monitor is as good as it was before I added the extension cord. And at a great price, too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect!
