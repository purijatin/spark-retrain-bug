It was not packaged by Belkin. It did not say Belkin on the cable itself. It came in a plain plastic bag. My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it, enclosed in Belkin packaging. I returned it to Sewell. They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs. They should specify this generic or bulk packaging, so that I do not waste my time ordering from them.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I received generic product from Sewell Direct.", "unixReviewTime": 1311811200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2011"}
