I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37&#34; TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A real SWINGER", "unixReviewTime": 1362700800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2013"}
