These cables are just as good, if not better. You won't be disappointed by the quality, and the length available here for a fraction of the retail price makes them a bargain.Frankly, the big box stores should be ashamed that they mark up items like this so much. The real quality and bargains are found online, with items like this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well made, great price!", "unixReviewTime": 1221696000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2008"}
