Its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine. The connectors are pretty good, the only negative I have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile; if you push them sideways very much they come right off. But honestly you don't need those ( they can even be annoying in tight spaces), and for $1 the quality can't be beat!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Can't beat the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1370649600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2013"}
