I particularly like the molded connector feature.  It's always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction.  I doubt that will be the case with this cable from Belkin.I also give kudos to the pricing.  I simply cannot argue with $3 for a 7 foot CAT5.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No complaints", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013"}
