They fit my router and are easy to install and remove. I have had trouble with some Ethernet cables in the past so I bought 3 different sizes of Belkin  and they all worked great.I even tested the cable and it was fine. I'll definitely buy these again in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good quality and fit", "unixReviewTime": 1390867200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2014"}
