It's a good price, and I like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management.  But this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than I am used to and I do not like that at all.  In order to press the plastic release for the connector, you have to fit your finger between two raised edges.  Clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem, and I appreciate the attempt...but this was too hard to use: couldn't release it with my thumb, had to use my index finger.  Plus you can't do it from the side, you have to have your finger at the correct angle, which can be a problem when you're under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good price, annoying connectors", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}
