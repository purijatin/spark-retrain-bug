We've got other Belkin equipment, and have been happy with it.  But, to be honest I didn't expect much for that price.  I figured it would be cheaply made, toothpick size cable, or the end locks would break right away.  They were actually a pleasant surprise, especially for how cheap they were being sold.  Can't complain a bit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A nice, thick, pliable cable. Can't beat it for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1390608000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2014"}
