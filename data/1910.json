But my 7 footers, shown on Amazon in an appropriately nicely formed loop, all arrived in a tight wad with sharp bends every 3 1/2 to 4 1/5 inches along the entire length, and then tightly bound in the middle with a wire tie. Each kink even created a discolored joint on the cable jacket. Cables don't like sharp bends (mine have 17 tight bends along a 7' cable), those kinks make cables hard to string and route along small spaces, they make a rat's nest behind my comm gear, and they jeopardize the integrity of the cable.C'mon Belkin, your \"Pro Series\" packaging is a silly gimmick, because at a thrifty $2.50 per cable, I'm betting dollars to donuts there's nothing special about your cables, no rare metals, no exotic coatings, no braided stainless shielding... it's a generic Ethernet cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Kindly treat it as such. Treat them kindly and fore go the glitzy packaging.Meanwhile, my 15' cables from Mediabridge happily arrived in a simple cardboard box, in a neat 5\" diameter coil. No kinks, no sharp bends. I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box, no fancy packaging, no rocket science, no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks, just a sound cable. Unfortunately, they did not have 7-footers when I needed them. So I went with Belkin, after all it's just a cable. Next time I'll wait for Mediabridge to re-stock.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Belkin 7-ft RJ45 CAT 5E ethernet cable: Belkin doesn't understand -- don't kink electronic cables!", "unixReviewTime": 1360972800, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2013"}
