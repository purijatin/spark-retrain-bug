The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Price, Great Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1332979200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2012"}
