(Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DVR, and a computer)These cables are great, they are high quality, and have sturdy connectors. They are gigabit cables.I stream 1080p .mkv files from my laptop to my Xbox 360 via Windows Media Center, wireless N does not cut it, but these cables do the job.Even though I doubt I will need speeds over 100mbps, I like having gigabit cables, and I like these cables better than the cheap blue ones on amazon. The cheap blue cables have weak connectors in my experience, and have broken off.I would definitely recommend this cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great cables", "unixReviewTime": 1294012800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2011"}
