Plus, the price was the lowest I've found for this brand name cable. Of course, it's working fine. It's manufacture and durability appear among the best. Don't get me wrong, I use and am happy with the generics too...only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this Belkin brand. I expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Genuine Belkin Cat5e Ethernet Cable", "unixReviewTime": 1306972800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2011"}
