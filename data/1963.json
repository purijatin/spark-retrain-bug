Northrip \"SamN\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Just after buying a new computer (Dell), I realized that it would be a good idea to replace my modem to computer (Cat5) cord. When the cords arrived, I connected them then logged on. Could not believe the difference. I was using an older blue cord that I picked up from a family member. I ordered this cable because I wanted a longer cable, but was really happy and pleasantly surprised  with the increased speed. We have SBC DSL Elite, and everything is so much faster with the new Belkin Cat 5. I recommend this Cat5 cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Cable.
