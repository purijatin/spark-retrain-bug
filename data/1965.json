They aren't the exact ones shown in the picture, or at least, the ends look different, but they still have the \"snagless\" design, albeit a slightly different one.  Still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable.  I used it with my TrendNet ethernet switch, with no issues yet whatsoever.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works perfectly", "unixReviewTime": 1324080000, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2011"}
