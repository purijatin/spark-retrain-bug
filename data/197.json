This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "awesome!", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2013"}
