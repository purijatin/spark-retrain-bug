I needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way, but allow me to move away from my desk (7 Foot). I can enjoy higher speeds with this CAT 5e cable connected vs my wireless connection. I like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakage.Belkin International, Inc., is a American manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. I feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a American company.I have purchased Belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use. I have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic CAT 5e cables. This is the reason for my interest in Belkin's snagless design. Without the locking tabs the cables slip out if moved.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I am connected with this cable as I write this review", "unixReviewTime": 1329955200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012"}
