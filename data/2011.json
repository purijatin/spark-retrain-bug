But you know what? They're still hanging in my bar putting out good music. Well, I play the good music. These just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible. But that's beside the point. Look, they're not like super bass-heavy subs. They're just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar. They get plenty loud and they look plenty good. I have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them. UNTIL THEY GET THEIR DAMN FACES ROCKED OFF.
