A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them, but for $30.00, you just can't beat these speakers.  They are easy to set up.  Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage, patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1220227200, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2008"}
