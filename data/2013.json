However, it wasn't soon before I felt rather dissatisfied with them.  Not unhappy, but just aware that I was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers, so I resold them.However, I also own a pair of the AudioSource LS200 speakers.  They cost even less than these speakers, and to me have a bigger and warmer sound.  I'm still using those and plan to be for quite some time.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not bad for the price, but not satisfying in the long haul.", "unixReviewTime": 1163203200, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2006"}
