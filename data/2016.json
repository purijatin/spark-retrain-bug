I bought these as a cheap unknown brand speaker that I could use and abuse while leaving them out in all weather conditions...rain, snow, ice and a few hurricanes through the years and getting knocked around by kids. The sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations. The overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than I thought they would (6 years now and all year long outdoor usage). Due to the fact that I crank up the volume very high for when I'm mowing, or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party, with or without other people  :)  ....  I'm now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on it's way out. It still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other 3. Just a good all around speaker that does not break the bank.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Surpassed my expectations with sound Quality and durability", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"}
