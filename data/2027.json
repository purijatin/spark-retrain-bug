Time is tight too. The Motorola 280's have been a great time saver. Sometimes we  split up in the mall. One of us goes to do some shopping while the other  has fun with the kids. We don't have to worry about setting up a time and  place to meet up. It's easy to ask a question or change/make plans from 1/2  mile away. We use it on hikes and while walking around the neighborhood.  They're also great when you are travelling with more than one car.The  range is supposed to be about 2 miles. It can differ depending where you  are.Everything I've said is a good reason to by any 2-way radio. Why did  I choose this model even though it costs a lot more than some of the other  ones?-They're compact. Even more compact than the the 280's that take  regular batteries. Their size makes them easy to bring along anywhere. They  also have a removeable belt clip. Clip them on your pants or belt or remove  the clip and they slip easily into your pocket. -They're rugged. The 280's  survived drops onto pavement and gallons of baby drool. -They have 14  channels and 38 privacy codes. If you go somewhere where there is a large  crowd, you will run into other people with radios. The extra channels help  you find a quiet channel. However, we rarely have to change  channels.We've had ours for almost 2 years now and they have been very  useful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "We use our TalkAbout 280 all the time", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
