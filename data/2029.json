I have used them to keep in touch with my children when they have played in different soccer fields, when they ride their  bikes in the park, when camping, picnicing and hiking.  The units are easy  to use, even for a 5-year-old.  It makes them feel important, too, so they  willingly keep in touch.I have found the TalkAbouts to easily withstand  the rigours of active pre-teen boys, and the reception has been good, even  in built-up areas.Battery use is reasonable, the units are tough and  easy to use.Any parent will find a use for these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Essential Parenting Tool", "unixReviewTime": 963187200, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2000"}
