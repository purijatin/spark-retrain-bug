Santa brought us four of these lovely little two-ways this year at Christmas, and I couldn't be more pleased. We've had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews, (although we don't ride on mountaintops), and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand (not to mention the cool factor!).The radios are durable; we've dropped them in snowbanks, had them grawed on by curious horses, and thumped around in saddlebags. They're certainly useful, we know if one of us gets separated from the others they'll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for, they're just perfect. We looked at a bunch of GPS handhelds, and decided we didn't need anything quite that high end. For the average family who hikes or skis, trailrides or just goes to the Mall of America, these are the perfect belt accessory. Go for it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A useful gadget for the average family outing...", "unixReviewTime": 981849600, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2001"}
