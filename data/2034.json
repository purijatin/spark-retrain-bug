I am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port. I had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a ZIP drive, but it seems to work about the same  speed as an ATAPI drive I had preinstalled on my PII 400Mhz. The price is  right for ZIP drives. Don't bother with the 250 MB drive - disks are more  and not enough people have the drives yet that support them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great on a 486", "unixReviewTime": 958694400, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2000"}
