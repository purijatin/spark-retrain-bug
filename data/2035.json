Its a nice, accepted standard, and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3.5  floppies, no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without  damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB  super-drive, which is a drive that is backwards-compatible with 1.6 MB  (traditional)3.5 floppies, so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it.  A couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture, but  super-floppies haven't really caught on.In terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house, it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering  files- such as printer sharing and web sharing.-Note.  I think the zip  100 is more functional for the price than the 250 zip. -(For backing up  really large files, the best thing these days is a cd writer or re-writer.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the most popular removable storage next to floppies", "unixReviewTime": 944697600, "reviewTime": "12 9, 1999"}
