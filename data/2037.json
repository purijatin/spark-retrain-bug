My workplace has over 1,000 employees and the majority of them are on Windows, while I am one of 3 people in the organization that consistently uses a Mac.I am sent files all the time via the Network GroupWare e-mail system. I never wanted to hook my Mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a Novell system, so I never got the Mac version of the software to connect my Mac fully to the network.So, when someone sends me a file via GroupWise, I copy the attachment onto my ZIP disk and then eject that disk and put it in my Mac to work on the file.  Not the most efficient way to go about things, but this 100MB Iomega ZIP drive hasn't failed me once in the past 4 years.Since the Mac OS can read both Mac and PC ZIP disks, I use PC formatted disks and move them back and forth from Windows (the Parallel drive) to Mac (the factory installed 250MB drive) all day long.ZIP disks can hold an equivalent of about 74 floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies. My only gripe is that Iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch... even if your computer is off for a week, you've got to unplug your ZIP drive if you don't want it to eat up electricity. Honestly, I doubt that a little ZIP drive that isn't spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month, but it's a waste nonetheless.  This one gripe wasn't enough of a drawback to take a star away from the 5 star rating I'm giving this gizmo.  It's dependable, it's fast and ZIP is an industry standard. Hats off to Iomega.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sturdy workhorse for 4 years", "unixReviewTime": 1011830400, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2002"}
