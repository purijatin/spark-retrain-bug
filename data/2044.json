Senior", "helpful": [14, 18], "reviewtext": ".If you have a Palm V or Vx this is the case to get.The Vx is a  classy looking Palm. The case makes the Vx into a Porche.  The combination  of the two is terrific-- performance and looks.There is one problem  with turning the power but a software hack fixes this.A great gift  idea for an intelligent businessman or woman.  The more you use these t  devices the more you will come to depend on them.If you want to use  this as a wallet, it is a good option.  I like to keep my wallet trimmed  down without a lot of junk.  This is not a real wallet so you can't  accumulate junk in here.The Palm Vx complements this in that you can  quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in  your wallet-auto records, expenses, etc.  And toss those out or if you want  to keep them dump in a monthly file folder.I strongly recommend the  combination of this wallet and the Vx.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great case that doubles as a wallet", "unixReviewTime": 967593600, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2000"}
