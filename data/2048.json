I wanted to protect my Palm V from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket; but I didn't want to significantly increase its size and weight.This case fits both bills  nicely.  The added bulk and texture of the leather holds the Palm in your  pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls; and when  it does fall, even if it lands on a corner, the screen doesn't crack.  Just  what this doctor ordered.I use the pockets to store a couple of cards,  nothing more.  Works like a charm.  The clasp is sort of odd, just a tab of  leather slipping into a buckle.  A snap or velcro would have been nicer,  but so far it does hold closed on its own.The leather smells nice and  has been wearing well.  The little Palm logo embossed on the front is sort  of cute, too.  Overall I'm happy with this case and the price is certainly  right.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extra Protection For Your Baby", "unixReviewTime": 961804800, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2000"}
