I then had to convert to a current word processing software, OpenSource.Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac. But for some reason my iMac couldn't &#34;see&#34; or read the Iomega Zip Drive (it &#34;saw&#34; it at the USB Hub). So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac. Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive.  (Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine [have 10.7.5, Mountain Lion]).  In a round about way, the technology served its purpose!  Thank goodness.  (The Seller was quick in responding to my questions.  Good Customer Service.)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Amazing.  It's great when obsolete technology saves the day!", "unixReviewTime": 1381017600, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2013"}
