Great performance, fast transfer rate, not very noisy at all comparing to an LS-120 I own. I recently bought a Zip 250MB, and so far it's get my thumbs up! Full compatibility with the 100MB disks. If you want a portable storage device put your money on a Zip drive. CD-R &amp; CD-RW media are great. The only drawback is the media being used over and over. CDs aren't a very reliable comparing to cartridge disks. Cartridge disks are more reliable and last longer in the re-write processes of everyday backups of your files. And keep in mind that the Zip drives or less expensive and are easily transported anywhere, easy to install and work with.
