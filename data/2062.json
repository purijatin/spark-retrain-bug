No one however who answered had ever actually tried it in Win 8.The software for this drive took down Win 8, and I had to do a reset to get it to restart Windows.  Major flaw.IT DOES NOT WORK IN WINDOWS 8,  ACER COMPUTERS.I have applied for a refund.Update:  I tried to load it after the fail on Win 8, on a laptop I have with Win 7.  After loading the software, Windows would not start, and still will not.  I would not try it on Win 7 unless you know what to do when it won't start.  I have to have mine repaired, and minimum repair is $70.  That's a high price to pay for just trying a product that was defective.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Does not work in Windows 8", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2014"}
