Leave it in your slot all the time, it won't have an effect on your system when the CF card isn't in, but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system.This means that you can dispense with the camera-to-computer cable and just plug the card into the slot.  When you do, it will be recognized as a removable disk, kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk, and show up in your &quot;My Computer&quot; view or Mac desktop, and maybe (this is how Nikon View works anyway) pop up your digicam software.This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Convenient little device", "unixReviewTime": 997574400, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2001"}
