Say goodbye to those bothersome cords! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE. One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading. I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing! It's so simple to use, light-weight, compact -- and incredibly inexpensive! How simple? Plug your CF card in one end, plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive. How sweet is that?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Inexpensive and still fantastic", "unixReviewTime": 1028160000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2002"}
