I have used mine in both a Dell Latitude running WinXP and an Apple Ti800 running Mac OS X. It is the only way I transfer pictures now. Much easier to carry than a USB cable, plus it is faster, does not use up the batteries on the camera, and just flat out works perfectly.Here is how I use it :I take my picutres (duh ;-), remove the CF card from the camera and insert it into this adapter. Then I insert it into the laptop. Under both Windows and Mac, the CF card appears as a removable drive on the computer.Under Windows, I navigate through a couple of folders to where the pictures are stored and copy them to a folder on my hard drive. On the Mac, iPhoto automatically opens up (because I have told iPhoto to startup automatically when a camera is connected) and it gets ready to transfer the pictures. I can then tell it to copy the pictures to my Photo library, and delete the originals. It does just that. Then on the Mac and PC, I tell the operating system to eject the drive/device, then I can pop the adapter out of the computer. Of course you can pop it out whenever you want, but you will definitely risk something bad, better to eject it the proper way. I can transfer a full 128 MB flash card to my computer is a minute or so. Fast enough that I haven't timed it.So, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses CF media with a laptop. It is the way to go!...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So nice, so very nice", "unixReviewTime": 1020816000, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2002"}
