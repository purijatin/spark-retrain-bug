All you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your Slot and bam! It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works like a charm.", "unixReviewTime": 1029196800, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2002"}
