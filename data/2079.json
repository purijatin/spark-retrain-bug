This adapter works great. Plugged it in and WinXP automatically recognized it as E drive. This adapter worked in Win2000 and Win98 as well. Great price and buying it new is actually cheaper than used!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great price for performance", "unixReviewTime": 1028592000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2002"}
