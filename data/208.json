I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections (thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV)so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes. Both simple and quite easy. Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw. I was able to install a 32\" RCA TV, without any help in less than 20 minutes.Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware, as well as a hex wrench, a small open wrench and a level.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid product", "unixReviewTime": 1324771200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2011"}
