My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isn't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.  The velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone.  A few snaps would have been much better.  Other than that the quality is first rate.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High quality case but lacks some features", "unixReviewTime": 1252713600, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2009"}
