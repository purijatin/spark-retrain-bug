Not very much stuff. So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag, where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal, daily usage. There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "meh", "unixReviewTime": 1283558400, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2010"}
