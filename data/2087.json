And I never paid a dime for the 10 that I had.I get these for free back when I worked for IBM. We were moving out of a client site and moving our assets out of that client company. I have a stack of these things and was told to throw them away. I decided to keep them as they were near brand new, some still had the product inspector's card in it. I cleaned up the leather and conditioned them.I still have 1 left. I gave the rest away...wish I had known how much these sold for~!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Roomy and leathery", "unixReviewTime": 1324166400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2011"}
