Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit (~$34) in April 2013, and received a Devcon CL (combination lock and cable ~$21) that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund, so I was OK with this. Just FYI, if you are ordering this and paying for shipping.It looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~$300 RV voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping. But, rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller, I opted to use something else.  Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping. Sorry this is not a review but I HOPE this helps someone.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Just a heads up on a potential problem", "unixReviewTime": 1367280000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2013"}
