There are only two problems with this little lock, the first is, it tends to seize up on occasion, but it comes out after a few seconds (not 5 minutes as mentioned by another reviewer).  Also, this lock is fairly easy to change the combo, so if you have a roommate that hates you, or criminals that carry around screwdrivers, you may be in a bit of trouble.This is a MECHANICAL lock, it does not have a \"mind o it's own.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Follow the instructions", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2009"}
