I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter.  Mind you, the lock portion was destroyed, not the cable.  The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers.  Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidably-equipped metal cutter.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Design Flawed!
