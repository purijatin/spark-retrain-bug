I bought in 2009 and I used on september 2012. for first time because I needed. I had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap. I needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension, because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off, so i split the power and it was everything ok, and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic. Me and my roomate saw it and yes, the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged, and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen, what if we just leave and leave this protector running, I am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back. In other words I had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection, my 5 dollar protector \"extension\" workd better than this pice of s*** because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt. BE CAREFULL PELASE AND SAVE MONEY. Just keep an eye  on this, if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will NOT PROTECT INSTEAD THIS WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE Try by yourself if not beleive it. if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on fire.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "CERO STARS MIGHT BE BETTER PLEASE DONT BUY", "unixReviewTime": 1355961600, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2012"}
