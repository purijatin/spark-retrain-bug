One day, \"POOF\" went my computer during a quick power outage. The incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for APC to handle.Sent my unit in for eval, as they request. They said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product, they would NOT compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being fried.Are they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge, it may be a case of the MOVs NOT blowing? MOVs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage, protecting your electronics from the surge. Their device failed to stop a surge, failing to protect my equipment!My advice - if your equipment and data are valuable to you, then purchase one of the \"series-based\" surge protectors (APC does not make these). As they say, you get what you pay for. Except with APC, who fail to honor their warranties.For those who insist on using cheap surge protectors, I hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of Deer Whistles. Same sales principle - make them cheap enough for everyone, spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job, then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure, or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product. If APC sold Deer whistles, and a deer hits your car, they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defective.The product may not have failed mechanically or electronically, but it certainly FAILED to provide protection. Pay up, APC!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "APC Warranty Is Worthless - Look Elsewhere", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"}
