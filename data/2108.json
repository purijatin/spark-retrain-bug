Instead of more safety, we had less.This is unacceptable for this type of product and causes concern about my other APC surge protector that I purchased later but was not in the recall.  Does the later product not have the same problem or has it not been out long enough for customers to report problems?  I chose to avoid the possible risk and to replace it with a different brand.Also unacceptable is the only recourse for the consumer is to apply for a newer model.  A better company would have offered a full refund option.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any more APC products.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Recalled Oct. 2013 - Purchased March 2010.
