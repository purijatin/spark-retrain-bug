Mccaffrey \"Matt OneLANE\"", "helpful": [29, 29], "reviewtext": "APC (which by the way is American Power Conversion, not \"American Power Conservation\" as amazon.com currently shows it) has always been serious about clean power. This is no ordinary surge protector. It has more  heavy-duty protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than  you're ever likely to see. But what I like is the intelligent layout of the  outlets ... with my ADSL modem, I now have three huge \"wall warts\" to deal  with. The PRO8T2 handles them well, and manages another smaller one in the  top tier of outlets. A large green light lets me know it's working. And the  switch guard is removable -- if you WANT to be able to turn this unit on  and off with your toe, APC made that possible, and they call out the  feature in the instructions. You can spend $20 for a much less capable  power station, or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your  stuff. APC delivers the latter with this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sort out your blocks", "unixReviewTime": 963964800, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2000"}
