After my Belkin protector broke after a direct lightning hit on my house, I purchased this item. The equipment I had plugged into the Belkin model did not survive the direct hit. The other model of APC I had did protect my iMac. I will never pruchase another Belkin again. Belkin is cheaper, but you get what you pay for. APC are built better, feel more solid, then the cheap plastic Belkin protectors are.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid Equipment", "unixReviewTime": 1320883200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2011"}
