Saunders \"Equal parts tech geek, bra...", "helpful": [32, 35], "reviewtext": "I just replaced the Garmin GPS III+, which I had in my truck, with the  ColorMap. The screen is much easier to see in a variety of lighting  conditions. The ColorMap also changes some of the field colors, depending  on the time of day, to provide ever greater visibility. This unit is really  designed to be used in a vehicle and provides features to that effect such  as a readout stating which road your currently on. This is much easier than  trying to find the road label while you're driving along.The ROM maps  cover most major areas of the US, but for true coolness you need a memory  cartridge and a copy of the MetroGuide CD ROM. The areas in this software  are HUGE so I suggest going with the 16 Meg cart and skipping the 8 meg  one. For example, Northern Virginia takes about 7 Meg and the DC metro area  is another 7 Meg. Anyone living in either area probably wants both regions  available so you can see that the 16 Meg cartridge is key. All in all, a  very cool toy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top notch", "unixReviewTime": 967075200, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2000"}
