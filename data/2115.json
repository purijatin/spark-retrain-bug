Burnham", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "I bought my SP3 when I moved to the Washington DC area, and have to say it works great.  I am never lost and it can find nearly everything.  There are a few streets that have no numbers in Arlington, but otherwise it is pretty good.I have also used the SP when traveling to other areas.  The one issue that I have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings.  DC is not too bad, but I have had bigger problems in places like NYC and Toronto with the tall skyscrapers.  If it is plotting a course for you, you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds.  To make things worse, since there is such a grid in the cities, it often takes a while to recalculate the course, by which point you might be lost again.  I find times when I need to pull off and wait for the GPS to catch up.I would highly recommend it if you travel a lot, or are unfamiliar with an area, just be careful if you are using it for large cities.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good, but has some limits", "unixReviewTime": 1032566400, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2002"}
