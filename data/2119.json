However, my Palm Vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb, and it's because of this case.  It opens easily, closes easily, and still fits in my pocket comfortably.  I'm confident the Palm's screen is protected with this case.  It's given great service for over a year now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does its job admirably, and looks good doing it.", "unixReviewTime": 980208000, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2001"}
