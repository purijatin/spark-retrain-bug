I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Effective and inexpensive", "unixReviewTime": 1341446400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2012"}
