One reviewer wrote that it is difficult to charge the Palm with the case on. It really isn't a problem at all if you place the charger on the edge  of your desk so that hard case can extend off. I don't worry about it  falling over since the charge is so sturdy. I love the case because it  provides such great protection in a stylish manner. enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome case, buy it!", "unixReviewTime": 945561600, "reviewTime": "12 19, 1999"}
