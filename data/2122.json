It protects your Palm V from falls, spills, and related &quot;accidents&quot; I also like the look of the case a lot. It blends well with the design of the Palm V. The only  &quot;cons&quot; I could find to this case is that It will add weight and  size to your palm. Nonetheless, it is well worth the protection you get  (Plus, this will fix the problem the Palm V has with its regular cover of  turning itself on).  Sure, you'll have to pull the Palm V out of the case  to HotSync, but that will only take 2 secs. I love my hard case, and it has  certainly lived up to its job of protecting my Palm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great protection and modern looks.", "unixReviewTime": 948931200, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2000"}
