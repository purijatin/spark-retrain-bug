The consumer is fooled into thinking that this &quot;hard case&quot; is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim,  when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of  aluminum outside the plastic.  This case could easily crack under little  pressure.  I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case.  For 40 bucks you think  you'd get something nice and strong, but save your hard-earned money for  some other case.  If you want just something to protect your Palm V in, I'd  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case.  Even better, go for the leather case that has a  zipper.  For even more protection, go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors.  Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money,  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage  it.The only reason why you should buy this flimsy, overpriced  &quot;hard case&quot; is if you have a LOT of money to blow, care more  about looks than functionality, and don't care if your Palm actually gets  damaged.  This case will pop open when you don't expect it, and who knows  what will happen to your Palm's panel.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOT worth 40 bucks, is NOT strong, is made of PLASTIC", "unixReviewTime": 959817600, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2000"}
