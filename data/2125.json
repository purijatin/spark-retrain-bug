Afterall, it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it. I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces (brick, hard wood floor, etc.), and both the case and, more importantly, the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So, my advice is, if you are looking for real protection for your investment, just get one of these. There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others (unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range...).Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stronger Than One Would Think &#65533; Stylish, Too!", "unixReviewTime": 980294400, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2001"}
