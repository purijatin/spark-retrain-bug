It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy...I mean tool...safe.  Fortunately, I saw one in a store before I  ordered one.  As some of the other reviews have said, it's made out of  cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration.  The  hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak.  I don't think it's  worth the cost and I've seen them as low as $25.If you're buying a  hardcase, I'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm.  This won't  give it to you.  If you just want something that looks good to cover-up,  there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me, I decided to  spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case.  I'll let you  know how that goes.  So far, so good...check them out.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Unimpressive and NOT Worth Buying", "unixReviewTime": 960163200, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2000"}
