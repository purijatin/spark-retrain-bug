Palm just released a metallic blue special edition hard case that I like a little better, but this case is great.While the plastic was a bit of a  turn-off, at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more  attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the Palm V itself. I imagine  that is part of the reason you bought the V instead of the III or the  VII.The case does not close quite as tight as I would like, but if you  mess with centering the hinge it closes. It provides the best protection of  the cases I have tried and does not make the palm so bulky that you can't  stand to take it everywhere you go.I would recommend this or the new  blue case to anyone who likes the sleek modern look and wants to protect  their investment and their data.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just My Style", "unixReviewTime": 964137600, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2000"}
