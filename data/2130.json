I had a Palm III, but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket.  I switched to the Palm V series for its solid construction and rechargable battery.  I searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the Palm V hard case for this reason.  It protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package.  Even with the case, it's still smaller than a Palm III.  You have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to HotSync while still inside the case.  I had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish.  Other than that, it's perfect!  When I beat up the case too much, I'll just buy another one.  My Palm V still looks brand new!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An excellent value", "unixReviewTime": 972518400, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2000"}
