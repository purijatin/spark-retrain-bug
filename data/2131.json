Schwartz", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I'll admit it, I bought the case (the metallic blue one too!) just because it was sexy. It does a good job protecting my Palm Vx, but the case doesn't seem sturdy. There also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the Palm Pilot gets pressed by the case, this can be fixed by sliding the Palm just a hair. Overall, this case rocks, very glad I got it, the metallic blue one is better though, I get many compliments and good looks from it. Buy It!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sleek, Stylish, Sexy, but not as sturdy as it looks", "unixReviewTime": 989193600, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2001"}
