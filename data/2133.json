No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic, because one of the occasional problems I've heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that, I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it, it's worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Offers good protection", "unixReviewTime": 986428800, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2001"}
