Then I tried the &quot;slim&quot; leather case from 3Com, and it's OK, but bulky, and the strap that closes it is inconvenient.  Finally managed to find the hard case at CompUSA, and like it the best.  OK, it's not perfect.... you do have to remove the V or put it on a book in  order to HotSync, but so what?  For my money, the hard case is the way to  go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Case for the V", "unixReviewTime": 946425600, "reviewTime": "12 29, 1999"}
