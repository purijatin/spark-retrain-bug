The little leather flap that comes with the Palm is really not adequate to protect your machine.  This hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows.  It looks elegant and it's not too big - the Palm will still fit in your  shirt pocket when in the case. I recommend getting this one - you need to  get something to protect from scratching anyway, and this case protects  from much much more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Elegant and strong", "unixReviewTime": 949708800, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2000"}
