So I ordered 2 packs and was billed for 2 pack shipping. But when I received the batteries, it was a for pack. So if I only received 1 pack of 4 batteries instead of a 2 twin pack of batteries. Why was I billed for 2 twin packs instead of just paying for 1 4 pack. Very confusing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Was a bite confused at first", "unixReviewTime": 1393545600, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2014"}
