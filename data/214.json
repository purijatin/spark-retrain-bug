I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32\" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Robust Articulating TV Mount", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2012"}
