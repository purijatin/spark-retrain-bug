Plan was to use them for my digital camera.They work, but unlike the batteries that ship with the Kodak (which are 1600  mAH-rated), these batteries are rated at only 1200 mAH.  mAH means  milli-amp hours and is a measure of the amount of power the battery can  store and deliver before needing to be recharged.So, they deliver only  75% of the life of the higher-rated batteries.  My digital cam responds to  this with a half-battery indicator, even when all 4 batteries are at full  charge.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "These batteries are 1200 mAH", "unixReviewTime": 961632000, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2000"}
