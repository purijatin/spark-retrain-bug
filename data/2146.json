I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjoy", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Save the Space", "unixReviewTime": 970444800, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2000"}
