It was almost impossible to find a lock with its own plates! This comes with 3 plastic discs and a tube of superglue.Good points: thick cable, discs stick well.Bad points: cable only works with discs (not lock slots) or holes it can pass through. I don't want to stick a disc to my computer, so I'm using my old lock for it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome, great price.", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2013"}
