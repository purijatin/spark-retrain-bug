One of the hard drives died and I wanted to secure its replacement, so ordered another set. While waiting I wondered if I could get the plastic anchor off and re-use it. I set it on a table, placed a putty knife at the joint, and with one feeble blow popped it off. Now I don't feel as secure. The epoxy that came with the set worked fine, but didn't bond to the hard drive's plastic case as strongly as I would have expected.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Epoxy didn't bond well", "unixReviewTime": 1404432000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2014"}
