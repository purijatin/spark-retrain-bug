Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not the easiest to mount, but we LOVE it.", "unixReviewTime": 1374364800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2013"}
