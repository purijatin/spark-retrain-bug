I have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs.  I like this Kensington model so much that I have just purchased another as a gift.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nicely designed to accommodate various sized charger plugs", "unixReviewTime": 1384473600, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2013"}
