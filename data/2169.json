Here are some specifics regarding the product alone:15 oz: weight, not incuding cord, measured on my kitchen scales6.5 inches: Outside diameter of circular part2 inches or a little less: Height, with nothing plugged into itThe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legs/pads upon which it rests. Therefore, it does not slip on my granite countertop.Problem that this product solved: My kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop, and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop. I wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side, for cooking appliances (in the kitchen) or for plugging in my iPad or Kindle (while using them in the den). I can't imagine why an outlet wasn't thought of when my house was first built. I was going to call an electrician to add one, but this power strip seems to work just as well.How it solved my problem: The power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when I am using the plugged in iPad. I could only make it slip off if I pulled it hard in a horizontal direction. The cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den. The price ($40+) seemed high a first, but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "just what I needed", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2012"}
