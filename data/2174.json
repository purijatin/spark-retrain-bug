Pepoon", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work, where we hold many training sessions. We have used it for many months and not had any issues with it. It's heavy enough that it stays in place, and light enough that I can lean down, yank it over, plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath. It is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our (and our trainees') abuse without any problems. Perfect for areas where a long power strip won't work or would be less convenient.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy and Sturdy", "unixReviewTime": 1386028800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2013"}
