For me, that's good because it takes up less space. The footprint is roughly the size of a salad plate.4) Like most other plug strips, there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall, the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelf.I'm very satisfied with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exactly what I needed.", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014"}
