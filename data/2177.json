So when the need arose to purchase a second surge protector I went with another Kensington 62634.  For me the major selling point is the sixteen foot cord.I am very happy I purchased the same surge protector a second time.Today, 11-03-11 I finally became temporarily not lazy, opened the box.  It already has three outlets being used.I ordered another one but returned it when I found a better product by Kensington from another online store.  Of course the new model is much more expensive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive surge protector", "unixReviewTime": 1319068800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2011"}
