As many reviewers have pointed out, the design allows you to use ALL the sockets, as the sockets on standard rectangular power strips are often so close together that a plug for one device may block one or more sockets next to it.  It is also the most stable power strip that I own, as the round configuration keeps it solid on the floor exactly where you put it, even on carpet -- instead of leaning, lifting, and sliding around like many rectangular power strips (another plus that other reviewers have noted).  I also like the angled plug that plugs the power strip into the wall.  This allows the cord to point on an angle toward the floor, which helps conceal the cord and keep the power strip stable.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the cord that connects the power strip to the wall socket is too long.  I would have been happier with with an 18 to 24 inch cord, as opposed to several foot length of this cord.  Having all this extra cord to some extent defeats the purpose of what is otherwise an unobtrusive and compact power strip.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Terrific design; Cord too long", "unixReviewTime": 1335052800, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2012"}
