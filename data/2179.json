I have too many electronics by my bed and had one of those small white strip surge outlets. The problem was 3 of the 6 items I charge there have those transformer big plugs so I hade to plug and unplug all the time. With this one I can plug in my decorative lamp, floor Ott light, alarm clock, tablet, nintendo DS and breathing machine. Everything is now neat and I don't have to keep switching things out. At most only 3 items are in use at one time. I like the quick on and off button I can lean over and hit should I choose to.The unit is very well made and I expect many years of good service from it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not using on table but it works well on floor.", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2012"}
