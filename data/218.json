The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great", "unixReviewTime": 1388188800, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2013"}
