The shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones, hard drives etc. The power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use. Nice long power cord, heavy base keeps it from moving around to much. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent complement to power strip options", "unixReviewTime": 1345507200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2012"}
