I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick, but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something, I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range, and the writing area shifted down  also.  I can't tell if it's because the writing area shifted downwards, but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I can't say  anything else bad about it, but what a letdown to know that it can't take  simple impacts.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not shock resistant", "unixReviewTime": 957916800, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2000"}
