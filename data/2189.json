You  can read the other reviews to hear how this device will help you organize  your life and how wonderful it is. As a Palm collector (I have all Palm  and Pilot models), I will rather compare the Palm V to the  Palm Vx. The  only difference between the two is that  the V has 2MB of RAM, while  the Vx has 8.I have thousands of addresses, thousands of appointments, and  many  more to-do items, documents, etc. in my Palm. I  also have fax, e-mail,  and internet software  installed, among many other programs. I only use  about  1.5 MB. Therefore, although I have the Vx, I don't use any of the  additional memory. Technically, because of the additional  memory, the  Vx is faster. Nonetheless, because Palm  applications are so small, this  difference is truly  negligible. Therefore, before you spend $100 more on  the Vx, make sure you're going to use the additional memory. It's the  only difference.Now, remember: the V  series is rechargable, while the III series uses  AAA  batteries. Therefore, travelling with a V palm means you'll have to  carry around the cradle. If you'd rather use batteries, maybe  the IIIx is  better for you.Good luck!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magnificent!", "unixReviewTime": 948758400, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2000"}
