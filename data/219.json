The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great TV mount", "unixReviewTime": 1329523200, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2012"}
