You don't end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models 2. It costs lesser than the  Palm Vx 3. Synchronization with outlook 2000 is flawless 4. The screen is  very readable in bright outdoors 5. The battery lasts and lasts (they  aren't energizer bunnies!)Things I do not like about this:1. The  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy. 2. Applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitive.Overall perceptions:1.  Good value for the money 2. Buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work PCs (accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle) 3. Do not attempt to browse the Web on  this...you'll only be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent synchronization, good software,good bang for the $", "unixReviewTime": 952905600, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2000"}
