The Palm is easily the best designed  hardware/software since the Macintosh of the late 1980's.By the way, I  am also using the Franklin/Covey software for personal management and find  this is a nice increment over the built-in daily task list of the Palm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tough first week, thereafter an ESSENTIAL tool", "unixReviewTime": 939600000, "reviewTime": "10 11, 1999"}
