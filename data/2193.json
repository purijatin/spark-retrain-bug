Afterall, I loved the styling, but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.Unfortunately, when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket, it causes the power button  to turn on and then the up/down key constantly clicks.  Huh?So then I  went out and got the hard case (a rip off if you ask me), causing the  Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III.  That left me wondering why I  bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the  one I already had.Dad, can I get my Palm III back?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great style, but an important flaw", "unixReviewTime": 945820800, "reviewTime": "12 22, 1999"}
