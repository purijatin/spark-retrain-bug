Really.Prior to my Palm V, I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere, all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most. As a result,  I often forgot to do things that needed to be done, lost important phone  numbers, etc.-you get the idea.My Palm V changed everything. Now I keep  everything important, from the standard addresses, to do's, notes, and  appointments to my accounting info, stock portfolio, and local movie times  (thanks to AvantGo.com) all on my Palm V, and it's GREAT!A warning to  those buying Palm V's, though. It takes time to get used to it! I hated  grafiti (the &quot;handwriting&quot; you must use for the Palm to recognize  your input) at first, and found the miniscule on-screen keyboard a pain.  Additionally, I saw no real point in keeping a to do list and ALL my  appointments on the thing. After a month of forcing myself to do so,  however, I was hooked! After really taking the time to get familiar with  the thing, I use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than I've  used any other device (digital or old-fashioned pen and paper).So, my  buying advice: buy one! Palm V's are absolutely fantastic, really! They're  beautifully designed (you won't feel geeky pulling one out!) and the  handiest things in the world. I promise! (Be sure to buy one of the hard  cases to keep it beautiful.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely, Positively, Fantastically GREAT!", "unixReviewTime": 963705600, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2000"}
