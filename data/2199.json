Was it worth the wait?  You bet...although it's a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and LCD screens.  After filling up  my address book, downloading e-mail and news (through AvantGo), as well as  various applications and games I still have about 768K left.  2MB may seem  like a small amount of storage to some people, but it goes a long way as  long as you manage your e-mail, games, and amount of AvantGo channels you  read.  The HotSync operation only takes a few minutes, and I spent a total  of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti  language.  Once fully charged, the battery never seems to diminish no  matter how much I use it.  Even though the Palm V did not come with a nice  checkbook program, I found a free one immediately at download.com.  Now  that the US version is sold out in most places, I would highly recommend  considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the  same as the US version with an international AC adapter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The long awaited Palm V", "unixReviewTime": 963187200, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2000"}
