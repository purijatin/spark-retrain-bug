The piece that attaches to the wall isn't overly long, which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space I needed to mount it in.  The only issues I saw was that the joints were VERY tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it, the joints loosened up to the point where I had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fairly good wall mount", "unixReviewTime": 1283126400, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2010"}
