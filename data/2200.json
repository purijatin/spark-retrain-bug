After reading the specs on the Palm V and the Palm IIIe, I decided to buy the Palm IIIe. It seems that the only differences are about $200, the Palm V has Flash RAM  making it upgradeable, the cool look of heat blasted anodized aluminum. I  got a soft full-grain black leather case, which makes the Palm IIIe look as  cool as the Palm V. I feel that the Palm IIIe is more portable because you  can get AAA batteries anywhere and do not have to rely on the cradle /  charger. The funny thing is that I'm still using my Casio SF-4985ER Digital  Diary with 256 KB memory for my electronic organizing needs.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I like the Palm IIIe", "unixReviewTime": 947116800, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2000"}
