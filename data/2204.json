He says &quot;because it's small and convenient, it's always there so you can make quick notes as needed. It's perfect for keeping track  of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and  remembering things.Another nice feature is that using the HotSynch  connection, the PP easily transfers information back and forth from  computer to the PP itself. This is especially effective when one uses  Outlook, and the PP will even allow you to write and store email which will  automatically be sent later, if you choose.&quot;He loves this thing,  uses it all the time, and it certainly makes him more organized. His last  word on it is:&quot;I should have bought one a year ago!&quot;Go for  it folks, you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A tool that will pay for itself...", "unixReviewTime": 959040000, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2000"}
