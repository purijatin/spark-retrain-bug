Still a great handheld but only has 2 MB of memory and lacks the SD slot that the new Palms are being manufactured with.  If you just need a calendar and address book, this will do it, but the m100 will do just about the same (...)(with albeit a much smaller screen).  The backlight on the Palm V is woeful like the backlights on all Palms, but is not needed too often.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The classic Palm", "unixReviewTime": 1007683200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2001"}
