A few months ago my  palm V fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down, shattering the  screen.  I called 3com, and they charged me 100 dollars to replace it, and  sent a refurbished one that came in two days.  I was satisfied with the  process, and its good to know that they understand how important it is to  be back in action fast as possible.The leather flip cover that comes  with the V works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket, and  eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet,  which adds to the over aesthetics of this product.  A less obscure point is  that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm V around  just as much as you carry a wallet.I can use the infrared port on the  palm V to connect to my GSM phone (ericsson i888 on omnipoint), and get  regular internet access.  (requires proxinet, irdalink software, and a  standard isp).  Its not the most functional thing in the world- but it  actually works.  There is so much good shareware out there for the palm  (tetris, document readers and books, finance calcs, customizing hacks  etc.), and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and  install new programs with relative ease.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unlike AOL, the palm is number 1 for a good reason.", "unixReviewTime": 944611200, "reviewTime": "12 8, 1999"}
