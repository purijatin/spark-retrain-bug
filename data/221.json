You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent mount", "unixReviewTime": 1286841600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2010"}
