The Palm V has given me exactly that.  I've installed a couple of shareware applications, but have not found that  I use them, so the 2 MB memory is going to be fine for me.  The interface  is elegant and simple, and it's easy to input data with the stylus.  After  using the included cover, and then trying the leather case, I finally ended  up with the hard case, and I like it the best.  All the Palm users who talk  about how it has changed their lives are not just blowing smoke.... this  device has succeeded where countless paper organizers and calendars have  failed.  And it's fun, and looks cool!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm finally organized", "unixReviewTime": 947635200, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2000"}
