It is now March of 2008, and I am still actively using it. I am so very grateful. There have been some scary times when I thought the end had arrived, but I was wrong. The problem ended up being so crazy. A button was stuck. Consequently, the unit would run out of juice and not charge. Once I figured that out, I have been able to revive it without much incident. I have read many of the reviews about the Tungsten E2 and am quite discouraged about buying it. Thus, I will continue to offer life support as long as this Palm Vx allows. It has served me so very well!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It Continues to Live after 6 years!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1205884800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2008"}
