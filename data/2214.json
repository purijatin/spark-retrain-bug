I just bought my Palm V last week, and it's hard to imagine life without it now.  The Palm V is simply the best purchase I've made in a long time. It's an incredibly small and sleek little machine.  It  fits right in your shirt pocket, even with the hard case I bought for it.  It has all the standard things you'd expect from an organizer (address  book, to do list, agenda, expense report).  The Graffiti system (writing  instead of typing) only takes a little while to get used to.  The Palm  Desktop software and cradle allows you to back everything up in a few  seconds.  No batteries are necessary, because you can recharge the Palm Vin  the cradle.  Hundreds of extra programs and games can be downloaded. If  you're trying to decide which Palm to buy, I definitely recommend the V.  The Vx is about the same, but it has more memory (which I don't think I'll  need) and costs a lot more, the III series is great but not as sleek, and  the VII has the built-in modem, which doesn't interest me much.  Go for the  Palm V.  If you're trying to decide whether it's worth the money, the  answer is a resounding YES!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 949708800, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2000"}
