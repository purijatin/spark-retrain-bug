I won it over the internet and now I don't leave home without it!  Very simple to use and EXTREMELY useful.  I store telephone numbers, my date book, grocery lists, myriads of other lists for work and home, and just yesterday I downloaded a trial copy of SplashPhoto that lets me show a slide show of family pictures on my Palm V.  A GREAT electronic toy!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I never knew how much I needed this toy!", "unixReviewTime": 1003363200, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2001"}
