However I feel I need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper, not really cardboard or glossy. And the printing comes out rather flat. of course I have used Memorex before, but have always used glossy before, so they make great products, but this one is pretty much of no use to me. But it's mainly my fault for not reading more carefully.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "This isn't glossy or semi-gloss", "unixReviewTime": 1371254400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2013"}
