Keenan", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "I read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software. I found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning software(fellows/neato), I had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the DVD covers/inserts correctly. I spent maybe 10 minutes and then began printing(I use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual covers/inserts). Some have said they would like a glossy paper option and I agree. This paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but I still find it to be OK. If I has the option for glossy paper I would purchase that instead. I back up mostly movie DVDs and would like a more brilliant quality output. If I were backing up data DVDs, I would not have an issue with the paper quality. I have not used any other brands so I cannot, at this time, give a contrasting opinion of other products. I plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie DVD cover/insert needs. I will update later as I get more data on this subject. For now I'll say these covers are a good value for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job well", "unixReviewTime": 1268611200, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2010"}
