They also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts.  This is the same software for the CD labels, so it makes it easy to learn.  I was able to supply our kids with DVDs of them as children, each with their individualized jewel case and DVD label.  Made a great Christmas present.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent jewel case inserts", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2011"}
