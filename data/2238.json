The packaging directs you to a Memorex site that is defunct. You can search and find a third-party program that promises it will do what you need, while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well. I would not install it as it seemed unsafe. I tried contacting Memorex, but go no response. This left no real options for their use.I needed to print my inserts ASAP, though, and didn't have time to find something else so I divised a template of my own -- with trial and error, it worked, more or less. It was VERY time consuming, though. Memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they aren't going to legitimately support it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "No real software available", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2014"}
