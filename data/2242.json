Creating the design wasn't too horribly difficult. But after printing, it took a few minutes EACH label, to tear out and put together into a CD case. I wasn't expecting the puzzle... There are several different tear-lines; you end up with more ripped off bits and pieces then actual pieces for the case. Then getting it to go together in the case was like a game. If I had just been making a personal cover/label for my own dvd, it wouldn't have seemed like such a hassle. But making 40, I had to do it over the course of 3 days. It was quite tiring.I guess, for the price I paid, they at least got the job done. But don't expect an easy process, is all I'm saying. I felt like I 'signed up' for something I hadn't quite bargained for... 'Course, I've also never assembled my own cd cover before, so it could very well be like this with all of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Complicated Assembly", "unixReviewTime": 1315440000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2011"}
