The photo and music list lined up perfectly, without adjustment because I used Memorex jewel cases. The only issue I had was with the design software. I never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers. All the icons and instructions were clear, but the did not work. I could see the list download from the cd in the drive, and it showed up in the software library, but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover.  Ended up typing it in manually. Also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo. it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo. I could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground. So I reversed the process, placing the photo first and then the text on top.The paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case, however I wish it had a gloss to it. The photo came flat and a bit muted, even after changing out all the ink in the printer.Used this for a give away music cd for a party. It was fine for what I was doing, however I would not use it on a professional work project.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy to line up", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}
