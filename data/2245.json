But large companies buy products in bulk and they get the deals that the everyday user doesn't get.  But, in all honesty you could probaly run this card with no problems on an enterprise level network -- the performance is great especially for $15.But for general networking in a medium sized/soho enviornment you can't beat it.  This card seems to work with every system I have installed it on -- no matter the platform or OS.Its cheap, well documented, and easy to install.  Is there anything else really to say?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Medium Sized Company/SOHO Card", "unixReviewTime": 987206400, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2001"}
