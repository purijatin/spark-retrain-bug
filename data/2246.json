This might be true.  I'm not a beginner with network software or hardware but I'm hardly a pro either.  I had zero problems installing this (manual seemed  fine to me) and haven't had any problems using it since.  BTW I use it to  hook into my DSL connection.  If it didn't work I'd just send it back  (Amazon's always been great about this).  And the price is just too hard to  pass up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked fine for me", "unixReviewTime": 958262400, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2000"}
