I tried another brand  nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them. I took them  back and got Netgear FA-310TX. Plugged them in and it worked the first  time. I don't know about you, but I hate &quot;hard to install  hardware&quot; A great buy at Amazon... !  I need one more so I am buying  it here. Thank's Amazon", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy To Install And Works The First Time", "unixReviewTime": 964396800, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2000"}
