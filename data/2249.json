You don't want to use this in an enterprise environment...DUH!  I'm an MCSE and I wouldn't recommend this card to any company, BUT, for the home there is  absolutely nothing wrong with this card.  It works and you can get 2 or 3  at the price of one of those big dog names.  Do those work 2-3 times  better?  No, they don't.  I have 3 PC's of my own at home...6 altogether in  there and all have different NIC cards.  NetGear performs just as well as  the others and I wouldn't complain if I had one of their cards in every one  of those machines.So, in short, setting up a corporate LAN/WAN?  Then  don't pick up one of these cards.  Got a couple of computers or just one  and want to play network games with friends...save a few bucks and go buy  one of these and use what you saved on something else.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Why not pay less for something that is going to &quot;just&quot; work?", "unixReviewTime": 958521600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2000"}
