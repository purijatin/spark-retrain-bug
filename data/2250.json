It is an extremely simple card, but not much is required in a ethernet card. Those of you needing WOL support (why?!) should not purchase this card, as it does not support it. The speed and throughput is consistant with more expensive cards, my LAN does not require speeds up to 100Mbps anyway, but it is good to know it is there. The cards are good priced, so it will not cost much to outfit a small network with these cards, I have one in every desktop in our LAN. They work, what more could you ask?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple, Cheap and Effective", "unixReviewTime": 994032000, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2001"}
