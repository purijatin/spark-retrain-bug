I reccomend it for people wanting to quickly get a home network up and running. Provided you pay attention to the network configuration requirements for your particular OS, this card is most unlikely to give you trouble. If you think you have a card problem carefully recheck your config work a few times first before blaming the card.This card works great in Red Hat Linux AND Windows. It is the only Netgear card certified for Red Hat Linux 7. As a matter of fact I'm ordering a 4th FA-310TX card to replace a Linksys card right now. I'm involved in Linux and am presently converting an Emachines box to a 100% Red Hat Linux 7 machine. I ran into trouble with the Linksys FastEthernet 10/100 (Version 2) card in this box. It turns out Red Hat 7 can see that card, but not the Linksys chip, so I need to replace it. End of my use of Linksys cards (but they work just great in Windows networks and I have a complete Linksys-based network running for a client as well.) I'll probably stick to Netgear in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Well With Red Hat Linux, Windows 9x", "unixReviewTime": 980467200, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2001"}
