We have some  customers who buy cheap, and often problematic NIC's, ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on NIC issues. The NetGear FA-310 is one of their biggest problems. Made of  flimsy greenboard and &quot;? &quot; type Chinese components, NetGear's  crusade of inexpensive NIC's has made a joke of consistentcy. The price may  be attractive, yet you would be hard-pressed to find any company who would  commit to using NetGear NIC's throughout their operation: Simply because  the service and quality is inconsistent. NetGear's customer support is  short of laughable, as well.You get what you pay for. From my point of  view, I would avoid NetGear, Linksys, or any other &quot;Off-Brand&quot;  NIC and consider looking for one more dependable. You may pay a little more  for a 3Com, Intel, and SMC, but they are worth the price. They offer the  consistency and stability every NIC user should demand - Not just a  discount price.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Iffy Quality &amp; Stability.
