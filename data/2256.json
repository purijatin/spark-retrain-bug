They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality. I was running Windows 95 or Windows 98 on all the computers.  Setup was a snap.  Just pop in the card to an empty slot.  Then install the drivers from the floppy disk that comes in the package.  Worked flawlessly everytime.  I had no problems hooking up the ethernet card to a Linksys DSL/Cable Router, Netgear ethernet hubs, or a college dorm ethernet connection.Get this card and you will get the convenience of file and print sharing when used in conjunction with some sort of hub and windows network neighborhood.  Anyone with little to no computer expertise can do this just by following the instructions.  It may be a little difficult if you are scared of computers, but it can still be done.  Just follow the pictures that come on the step by step setup foldout.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value and Works Flawlessly with win 95/98", "unixReviewTime": 976579200, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2000"}
