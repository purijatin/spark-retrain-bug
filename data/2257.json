All without reading the manual!  This hub is  perfect for me because I occasionally attach a legacy 10Mbps device and  don't need more than three ports (other than to link to our existing  network).One warning - if you have other Netgear hubs and equipment,  keep the power supplies separate.  I had a single-speed 100Mbps hub and got  the power supplies mixed up.  The unit looked like it was working but  actually wasn't.  The power supplies look similar, the plugs are the same,  but I think the current and/or voltages are different.Other than that,  this is a great product.  As I said earlier, it just works.  When you  factor in price, you can't miss.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The thing just works!", "unixReviewTime": 941500800, "reviewTime": "11 2, 1999"}
