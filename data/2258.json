A switch and a hub basically do the same thing, except a hub sends all traffic through every port whereas a switch is more intelligent and only sends traffic to the port that is required to reach the intended destination.  Therefore, a switch almost always provides better performance.  A switch is probably what you actually want.This hub does exactly what it is supposed to.  Every connected device can see the network packets sent by every other connected device, which allows you to analyze the packets if you so choose.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for packet sniffing", "unixReviewTime": 1368748800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2013"}
