Hubs are difficult to find these days as low cost network switches are a dime a dozen, and provide isolation between network ports.But for network hardware development you do not want this isolation when you are trying to monitor network traffic between devices.  That is where an Ethernet Hub comes in.  Yes you can use \"managed\" network switches but those are more expensive than the garden variety network switch.This Hub was available at a fair price, and works fine.  If I need another one I would purchase again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hard to find, at a fair price", "unixReviewTime": 1368662400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2013"}
