It is built very solid (which is not true of all hubs) and seems to stand up well to some heavy use.  (I'll sometimes have to take it into work and I move it around frequently when I rearrange my office...so it gets more `mileage' than most hubs!)The one weakness I've found with Netgear is the Tech Support.  Their web site is not the most user-friendly site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything.  But it is all there and you can get PDF copies of the manuals and such, so that is helpful.  The one time I've had to contact Netgear phone support (related to a wireless network card) it was not impressive at all.  But for this hub, you should have no need for Tech Support and it is an excellent hub.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Hub, Netgear Tech Support could be better.", "unixReviewTime": 1017964800, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2002"}
