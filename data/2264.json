I looked at a lot of 10Base-T hubs, and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings. I am especially impressed with the hub's small size and metal case -- other hubs are larger and have plastic cases.To me, the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it, it just works. This hub gives me that in spades.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best hub for a home network", "unixReviewTime": 974419200, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2000"}
