They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality.  I was running at least Windows 98 on all computers I hooked up to the ethernet hub.  Windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing.After you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing.  You can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files.Setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already.  Even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Home Network!", "unixReviewTime": 975974400, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2000"}
