This case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that I need:  extra batteries, PC cables, the camera's manual and CD disk, and a Kodak AA battery charger.It works so well with the DC 3400, it's almost as if it was made for it.  Good case for the money.To see if this case is right for you, compare your digital camera's dimensions to Kodak's DC 3400.  If the cameras are similar in size, you're all set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great For Kodak Digital Cameras", "unixReviewTime": 1006128000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2001"}
