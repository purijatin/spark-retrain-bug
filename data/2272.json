Ustica", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "This case is the perfect size for the D-460 and accessories (case is approx 7&quot; tall X 3.5&quot; wide X 3&quot; deep). The main pouch is well padded and made of soft material. The bottom is reinforced to resist wear. Inside the front zippered pocket, there is a mesh pocket for memory cards, as well as an divided elastic band meant for 4 AA batteries. Inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch, which runs the entire legnth of the flap (approx. 6&quot;x3&quot;), for extra accessories.The only thing I dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak, and seems to come open without much force. I would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closed.Other than that, this is a fantastic case, and I recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great case, fits Olympus D-460", "unixReviewTime": 989280000, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2001"}
