I guess that I realized Ithat I wanted a larger style bag, though this one worked if I just wanted to bring along the camera and an extra memory card.  I was never thrilled with it, and then I purchased a new camera (canon G1) that did not fit in this case.  That was when I realized how good life could be with a larger bag.If you want a small case to just carry your camera and a few very small accessories (4 AA batteris and a memory card or two), then this might be the one for you.  But it wasn't the right one for me.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "OK if your camera fits", "unixReviewTime": 975110400, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2000"}
