Oshiro", "helpful": [14, 14], "reviewtext": "This is the best camera bag I have purchased, especially since it has the quality of any other Case Logic product, superb!I own an old Toshiba PDRM1 digital camera, and in this neat little bag, there is a protected pouch for the camera, two storage areas for digital media, and a storage for 4-AA (or AAA) batteries.I think this bag is super convenient, since I can carry my extra SmartMedia cards and spare 4-AA batteries.  The size of the bag is small enough to fit in my travel bag, but yet, has a lot of storage space for all the necessities of a digital camera.I highly recommend for a small digital camera like my Toshiba PDRM1.  Dimensions of my camera: 4-3/4&quot; long by 3-1/4&quot; high by 1-1/2&quot; deep.  This camera is a perfect fit for this particular bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High quality for a camera bag", "unixReviewTime": 991526400, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2001"}
