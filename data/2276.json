It has room for everything I need for the camera.  The camera itself, battery charger, an extra set of batteries, a couple of extra media cards, the accessory cords for downloading.  All this fits into the bag very securely, without everything banging into each other, because of the pocket dividers.The bag is not too bulky, rather compact with padding.  The zippers function very well.  The pockets designed such that I don't have to worry about things falling out.  Overall, a very good bag to take along with the camera and recharging supplies.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1007942400, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2001"}
