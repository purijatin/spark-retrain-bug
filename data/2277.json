It's quite a nice bag, relatively compact and easily fits my C-4000 with plenty of protection offereed by the walls of the case and padded divider.  There is plenty of room left for cables, a flash or even another camera if you've got one.  A mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offers a handy place to store my SM cards.  On the other side, another component offers 4 elastic loops for batteries,  and 2 mesh pouches (1 zippered) for storing more batteries or whatever else you might have.  I can easily store 3 sets of 4 AA batteries in here, with plenty of room for more SM cards.  And to top it all off, a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff (nothing too thick though).  There's an adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over your shoulder, plus handles on the top and side, so there are plenty of ways to grab onto the bag.  The only think I don't like about this bag is that mine doesn't seem to want to stand up.  It always ends up rolling over onto its back.  This however is a pretty minor thing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handy bag, pack in a lot for the size", "unixReviewTime": 1041984000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2003"}
