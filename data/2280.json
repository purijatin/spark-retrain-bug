However it is not big enough to room the Sony Mavicas. So dont bother getting this for those.I do have a problem with this bag and that is that it seems like the accessories on there are really stuffed onces your camera is placed inside it. Because the camera comes with the USB Cable and the tv connection cable and it's hard to  pack all of them in here with the camera without stuffing them in.....There's place for a battery recharger in there and a set of batteries along with the Compact flash cards. Overall this case is pretty decent although you've got to be careful not to let the case swing about from your arm and hit a wall or something. There are other websites selling this a little cheaper.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Bag  !", "unixReviewTime": 993686400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2001"}
