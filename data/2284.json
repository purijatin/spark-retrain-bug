Earlier this year the alarms went off indicating that the battery needed replacement.  I thought that was odd considering the age of the unit.  No problem though,  I'll just log onto APC's website and order a replacement battery.  Wasn't I surprised to see that APC indicates that this model doesn't have a replacable battery.  This didn't make much sense to me since the unit has an access door to the battery compartment.Well,  I removed the battery and found a web vendor that had a replacement for $18.  It is a very common 12volt cell and was available from several vendors.  The unit is back up and working well again.I have experienced several black-outs in the past few years and this UPS can keep my CPU, 19\" monitor, cable modem & network switch operable for enough time to save any work in progress and shut down my system.In closing, it is a well designed unit with adequate power for most home or small office systems.  But I was a little put off by the short life of the original battery and incorrect replacement information listed by APC.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Solid unit...with a catch", "unixReviewTime": 1039132800, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2002"}
