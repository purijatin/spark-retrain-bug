We have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month -- usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours.  Anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running.  However they don't last too long on battery power.  Just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down.The batteries wore out after about 2-3 years so I replaced them using batteries from a web vendor.  Now the first battery of this second round has failed so I'm buying another round of three batteries.Hopefully these units will last many more years.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Protects my stuff", "unixReviewTime": 1157932800, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2006"}
