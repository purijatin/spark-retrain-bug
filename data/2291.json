It has a built-in mock '3D' stereo effect, a 128-voice MIDI  wavetable, and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16-bit stereo, and that's  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesn't do anything wrong in itself  (it's plug-and-play, so if you're using Windows it should work out of the  box), the Soundblaster Live isn't much more expensive, and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and don't play many  new games it's a perfectly adequate solution, however.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bathtub", "unixReviewTime": 968025600, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2000"}
