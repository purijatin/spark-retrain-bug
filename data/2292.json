It puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer. It comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cd-rom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cd-rom. The drivers are included for all windows including xp.Why you wouldn't want this cardIf you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 (over 128 bitrate), 128 or less will sound fine with this cardI don't understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok for the price and basic functions", "unixReviewTime": 1017878400, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2002"}
