They really get you close to the action, and the 3-D effect is terrific.  Detail and sharpness are very good as well.If you wear glasses, you're better off removing them.  If you leave your glasses on it just doesn't work very well.  On the other hand, you are allowed to adjust each  eyepiece separate if you're like me and don't see 20/20.  However, there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece.  So you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars, then cover the left side to fine-tune the focus for your right eye. I found it a bit counter-intuitive, and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side.  Even so, once you have it dialed in, there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertently.My biggest issue with these binoculars is that they won't focus in close enough.  The target has to be close to 100' away.  Since they're high-powered binoculars, that's probably ok for most uses.  But I spend a lot of time watching birds 20' from my window.  Now I'm going to have to buy another pair for that purpose.They're also heavy.  Expect to put them down often to rest.  That's probably normal for binoculars this powerful.  When my wife first used them, she was shocked at how large far-away objects were.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good binoculars if you're not too close", "unixReviewTime": 1169078400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2007"}
