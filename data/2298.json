Only complaint is the flimsy attachments.  The neck strap is impossible to attach and is obviously a piece of junk anyway so don't bother.  I find it annoying that the lens covers aren't connected in some way.  They pop off very easily.  Just seems to me like something that could easily be prevented with better design.  All things considered, these are really minor complaints.  The purpose is to get great binoculars for a great price, and that I did.  I would still highly recommend them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product, flimsy attachments", "unixReviewTime": 1230163200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2008"}
