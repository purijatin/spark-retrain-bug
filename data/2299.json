They don't fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses, so one always sees double. I had several friends try them and they all said the same thing, so it isn't just me. With a name brand like Bushnell I thought I couldn't go wrong, but apparently their quality control is non-existent. I ordered these while traveling out west and couldn't send them back until I got home. I tried to return them, but Amazon said the last return date was one day before, so I am stuck with these useless binoculars. I need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "horrible", "unixReviewTime": 1378166400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2013"}
