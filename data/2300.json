No matter what I try, they just don't seem to provide a clear, distinct view. Seem abnormally darker than others I've used and never give a crisp clear view. On the other hand, they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones I owned, feel great, solid, nice set...but wish I'd kept my 30 year old set instead. Not good for bird watching. Can't begin to imagine for sports. Perhaps its my eyes? Unsure but they don't compare to 30 year old set.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bad for Birding - Make me dizzy", "unixReviewTime": 1256083200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2009"}
