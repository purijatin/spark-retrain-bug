The construction of the unit is almost all plastic and the ocular bridge flexes when you put any pressure on it. Though its nice to have a set of Bino's that don't break the bank if one of the young ones drops/damages/loses them. At 16x they can be little shaky off hand but I use this set primarily for spotting during rim fire shooting games and these binoculars make seeing .22lr bullet holes at 50yds very easy to see and score.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bino's", "unixReviewTime": 1329955200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012"}
