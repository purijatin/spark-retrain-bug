If you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something, then I believe these would be way to powerful and large. ( also I read somewhere, and I think its true that anything over 10x the magnification ( these are 16x) that you should use a tripod, since its too hard to see properly, since it needs to be completely still.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Info", "unixReviewTime": 1226793600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2008"}
