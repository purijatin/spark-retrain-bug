As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with \"high power\" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN \"NIKON EAGLE VIEW\" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!!!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "HEAVY, and UNSTEADY FOCUS", "unixReviewTime": 1124755200, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2005"}
