They're running Win98SE on an 800Mhtz Athlon with 160 MB RAM.  This brings me to a point I think is important.  Some reviewers (running Win2K or WinXP) left negative reviews for this item because it didn't work with their computers.  My advice is to know your computer before you buy ANY hardware for it.  You should know what operating system you're running (and its version) and your hardware configuration (at least your CPU speed, RAM and hard drive space).  If you're using Windows, right-clicking on \"My Computer\" and selecting \"Properties\" will give you most of the info you need.  So will \"System Information\" in the \"System Tools\" folder.  It's a simple rule and will save you a great deal of time and trouble in the long run.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Know Your Computer", "unixReviewTime": 1092873600, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2004"}
