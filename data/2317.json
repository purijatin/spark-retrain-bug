Under Windows 98, it ran at 48K. But in my case I had to enable the PCI slot through the BIOS. My PCI slots were disabled by default by the Phoenix  BIOS. I have a Dec XL-590. I tried to install it under Windows NT4.0 (SP6)  but to no avail. Even though service was excellent, the modem exhibited no  response after installation. I was advised to reinstall NT4.0 and the  Service Pack, but my system crashed. With a US Robotics internal faxmodem,  I got 51K in Windows 98. The difference is not significant, but the price  was. In general, I highly recommend this economical and fast modem under  Windows 98.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Modem - Excellent Technical Service", "unixReviewTime": 958089600, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2000"}
