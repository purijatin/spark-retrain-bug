When I log on, it seems to connect at 49333 every time. I guess that is good because my 33.6 connected at 31.9. I was going to buy that $25 one with the $20. rebate but from the reviews - you get what you pay for. I  went with Diamond and I am glad I did. The box says the requirements are  for a pentium 133 or higher. I have a Pentium 120 and it has worked great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Product / Easy to Install", "unixReviewTime": 943574400, "reviewTime": "11 26, 1999"}
