My external xircom [serial port] modem could connect at 53 kbs on the same line. (The effective difference between 49 kbs and 53 kbs  is negligible though, so who cares)The drivers for this modem loaded  easily the first time, and when I clean-installed win2000, they  automatially re-installed, no questions asked.On a side note: This modem  supports the rare 3.3 volt standard. (Some high-end workstations and  servers use the 3.3 volt standard, but everyone else uses the 5 volt  standard- so this doesn't matter for most people.  3 volts is an  &quot;emerging&quot; standard which will probably never catch on). Most pci  modems only fit into 5 volt PCI slots. A 3.3 volt pci card slot has  different gooves so that you can't mistakenly put a 5 volt card into it.  The supramax is compatable with both. (Silicon Graphics pointed me towards  the supramax after I struck out with another modem).Closing comments:  This modem has served me well, but now it collects dust inside my computer,  thanks to my cable modem.  It's still nice to know that it's there for me,  and I use it occasionally to test how long my sites take to load for the  [not-yet-broadbanded] people", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This modem goes both ways (3.3 and 5 volts)", "unixReviewTime": 957744000, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2000"}
