The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.  I used a 26\" tv.The whole thing went back in the box for a refund.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Junk, sags, wobbles, crooked, Rusted", "unixReviewTime": 1307577600, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2011"}
