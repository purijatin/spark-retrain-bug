Compact size, fantastic sound quality, no skipping, and easy transfer of music from a computer.  On the other hand, it only holds six or seven songs, the door on the battery case  doesn't stay shut so well after a few months of use, and a little abuse,  and the &quot;hold&quot; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.  If you can find it on the cheap it's a cool toy,  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunes.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Worth the price with multiple rebates", "unixReviewTime": 950486400, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2000"}
