When I first bought the product, I was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs. After the honeymoon was  over I started to have issues. The software that came with it, was the  music match software.It was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiry.I called diamond and they told me their RIO Port software was to  come out shortly. When the software did come out I found it didn't work  properly on the PMP300. I looked for some help files on &quot;configuration  / troubleshooting &quot; but there was none. Tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp300 doesn't always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software. 3 reinstalls later I still couldn't get the Rio  port software to work, so I gave up and I just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks. Since then my LCD has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke. The unit is about a year old now and  cost about 230 $ new.I really like my MP3 player but I will not buy  another RIO .I am looking at alternatives", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sound Weak quality Poor support", "unixReviewTime": 961027200, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2000"}
