The sound is very clear, the bass sounds very natural. Get them. I found them incredibly difficult to find, I searched over 20 sites until I finally got them. Amazon totally has a monopoly going on.  But anyway, bottom line, get these as soon as possible, because I remember when they were available for like $80 and when I finally found them at like the 23rd site they were $107. But they were worth it. Maybe watch it if they reach like $200. But otherwise, yes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get them while you still can", "unixReviewTime": 1087603200, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2004"}
