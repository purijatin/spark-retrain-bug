I remember when these first came out and were the first set of computer speakers to ever get a \"kickass\" review from the computer enthusiast magazine \"boot\", but I didn't buy these myself until 2003 when they were on clearance for super cheap.Kinda wish I had bought more of them when they were so cheap, since they're STILL pretty much the best 2.1 computer speaker setup you can possibly have.  The midrange these put out is unbelievable for a speaker this size.They look a little outdated (I have the black color so slightly less so), but damn do these sound good-and I've owned and heard pretty much every \"THX\" certified 2.1, 4.1, and 5.1 computer speaker ever made.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's really a pity Yamaha stopped making computer speakers", "unixReviewTime": 1196553600, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2007"}
