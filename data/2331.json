First and foremost, let me tell you one thing: wow, and I really mean WOW, what a great set of computer speakers!Understand: you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today, these speakers will, out of the box, work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint (and it is an exeedingly *small* one) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker (volume and on/off) and the sub woofer (base volume) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit (i.e. on a satellite speaker).  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Net/net:1) Awesome (I would even say unsurpassed) sound quality to cost ratio2) Extremely easy set-up (took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room)3) Wished the connecting wires were longer (the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer)4) Needs some industrial design tweaks (i.e. audio controls should all be in one place)5) Rich base, sweet high-ends, and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "FOR GREAT SOUND: highly, highly, highly recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1037836800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2002"}
