They are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head. They are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for non-lightweight headphones. They also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach. The only issue I have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones I have used that cost about the same. If you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around, it's tough to beat these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty nice", "unixReviewTime": 1362182400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2013"}
