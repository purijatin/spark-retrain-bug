You can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if it's loud. It does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well. For the price I'd say it's worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It serves it purpose well enough", "unixReviewTime": 1371513600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2013"}
