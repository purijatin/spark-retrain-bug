My only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and I have to take them off. It would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size, but for width. It would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top. Otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky, which was why I bought them in the first place.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Work well", "unixReviewTime": 1360540800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013"}
