He doesn't like his current headphone. It's the kind that covers the ears completely, and his ears turn red and itchy from it. This one doesn't cover the ears completely, but the foam part is still much bigger than your average headphone. So I took off the piano connector part and snap it onto the plug a cheap headphone with small foam area, and my son likes that way the best. I try to give the headphone to a different son but he doesn't like the feel either. Prefers the cheap ones he already has.The piano connector part snaps onto the regular headphone part tightly, plus it has an area you can grab onto so that you can pull everything out of the keyboard easily so that the piano part isn't stuck in the keyboard when you remove the headphone.So now I'm using in bed to watch movies on my computer while not disturbing my husband. It feels fine to me, but I have hair covering my ears. The sound is good. And it covers the sound pretty good. When I take off the headphone, I don't hear much from it.For the price, I think this is worth it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works good, but kids don't like the feel of the ear foam", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}
