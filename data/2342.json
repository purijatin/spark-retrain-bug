Howe", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewtext": "These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV, movies, etc.  However, in terms of comfort, they leave much to be desired.  The flat, hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin, somewhat scratchy &#34;cloth&#34; material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of one's ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton, or even a foam covering would be an improvement.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sound OK, Comfort SoSo", "unixReviewTime": 1361145600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2013"}
