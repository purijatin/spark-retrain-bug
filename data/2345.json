The pictures are grainy, blurry, and have color aberrations galore.  You can't even see facial features on people.  It is not a true 640x480 camera; it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution.  Downloads are horribly slow, and the memory is not removeable, so you can't use a better download method.  It will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2MB memory.  This thing is not even useful as a toy for your children.  Fortunately I bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back, and even refunded all shipping charges.  Do yourself a favor and get an Olympus D-360L or D-460Z.  ...a lot more money, but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This camera is HORRIBLE!", "unixReviewTime": 971308800, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2000"}
