Edelman", "helpful": [47, 47], "reviewtext": "I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not the best choice", "unixReviewTime": 950140800, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2000"}
