CCD is not  even 1/3 megapixel, is 1/10 I think. Images are bad (like enlarging a  thumbnail?) Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they'll be somehow  fine, anything bigger is like old CGA... awful. When you take shots they  look very bad, whatever you do to  edit (software) and fix them. I have  another (true) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent, but these...2/  It doesn't include an AC adapter, so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA  batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3/ Fine as a serial videoconference  camera (30 fps), but watch for the batteries.4/ Take your first picture,  and begin to wonder if it's ok. The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother  you when you find out you can't review your shots. Think about it: you wont  review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very  disappointed.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "BE CAREFUL!!!", "unixReviewTime": 966297600, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2000"}
