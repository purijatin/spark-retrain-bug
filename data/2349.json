It doesn't drain your batteries before you even took a picture(I took about 40 pictures(without flash) with my cheap rechargeable batteries). The four  stars missing is for the worst quality I've ever seen in my life. I suggest  to never use the flash(all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of  light, so it's all white!)This camera is too cheap(I think that my  batteries heavier than the camera itself)You only have to put the Cd  that it comes with it and it installs itself.I think uploading my  pictures(16) to my pc took 4 minutes!The camera was too easy to use and  I wonder why Agfa made these things.Finally, digital cameras are too  expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take  better pictures... you will regret buying this awful camera!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worse than I thought, but at that price...", "unixReviewTime": 960249600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2000"}
