Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate, I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver, which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "just got it installed", "unixReviewTime": 1356739200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012"}
