When my tiny &quot;came with the PC&quot; speakers died, I looked into getting some similar little speakers, but then realized that I could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set.First, let me say that the subwoofer BOOOMS! The bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system. Really remarkable. I used this system in my dorm room at Columbia University this summer, and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching DVDs, and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine. With the massive BOOOOM of the system, it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic.My only complaint, in fact, is that BOOM! The subwoofer doesn't have an independent volume control, so if I turn up the volume on the little speakers, the subwoofer follows right along, thunderously loud. A separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Baby got BOOM, but not separate volume control.", "unixReviewTime": 1001289600, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2001"}
