THE PC WAS AN OFF-BRAND AT THE TIME, KNOWN AS ABS.  AFTER RESEARCHING MY OPTIONS FOR BEST PC UNDER $1000, I OPTED FOR THE ABS MAINLY BECAUSE THE REVIEW RAVED ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE CLEAR AND ACCURATE SOUND FROM THE INCLUDED SPEAKERS.  I STILL HAVE THAT PC AS A BACK UP, BUT I CONTINUE TO USE THE ALTEC LANSINGS LIKE A SMALL BOOKSHELF STEREO SYSTEM.  I HOOKED THEM UP BY SIMPLY PLUGGING THEM INTO THE HEADPHONE JACK ON MY MP3 PLAYER, AND THE SOUND IS JUST INCREDIBLE.  IT PUTS OUT 30 WATTS TOTAL, AS MUCH AS SOME BOOKSHELF STEREO SYSTEMS COSTING HUNDREDS MORE!  THE BASS IS INCREDIBLE...I HAVE IT SITTING ON AN AREA RUG SO I DON'T GET EVICTED. THE HIGHS ARE SO ACCURATE, AND CAN BE TWEAKED USING THE EQ ON THE MP3 PLAYER.  MIDRANGE IS A BIT LACKING, BUT THIS ALSO CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR A BIT WITH YOUR EQ SETTINGS.  IF YOU CAN FIND THESE USED, GET 'EM!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "INCREDIBLE SOUND IN A TINY PACKAGE", "unixReviewTime": 1229990400, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2008"}
