However, if you are going to spend time with this, the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user (you completely forget its on your head) and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent value.
