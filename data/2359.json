Sound quality is excellent with several cell phones I have tried, and it is good with most cordless house phones (cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the  mic).In fact, sound quality is vastly better with other types of  earpieces and ear buds. In a normal room, no one will know you are using  it. In a car, it is slightly noticable.Some friends complain that the  earpiece flops around a bit, but indeed, it never falls off. (Unless you  have really small ears).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headset", "unixReviewTime": 963100800, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2000"}
