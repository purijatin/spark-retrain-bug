This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.  I bought this other one because I wanted a tight fit to the wall.Can I send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down?????", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Sags Sags Sags....and the hardware does not work properly.", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"}
