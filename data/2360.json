Make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isn't too heavy to carry around.  The only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button, so it's best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself.  I use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Value!", "unixReviewTime": 999734400, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2001"}
