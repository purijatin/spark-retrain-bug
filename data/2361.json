So others can hardly hear me.  Obviously, if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product?  For instance, ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you?  (And I'm short myself, so it's definitely  not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions.)But, even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low, though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment.  I don't have a need to wear one all the time, but just for certain calls.  I often found myself fumbling to get it on.  I think I'll try an over-the-head model next.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "They can't hear me", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
