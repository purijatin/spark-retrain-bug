I was skeptical at first about the plastic thing over my ear, but it's so light that I scacely notice. I also worried becuase the mike wound up next to my cheek not my mouth, but it seems to have no adverse effect on the sound. People I'm talking to can't tell I'm using it, and to me the sound is great. At the price, what's not to like? I got one for each phone in our house.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable, clear and the price is right", "unixReviewTime": 1001635200, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2001"}
