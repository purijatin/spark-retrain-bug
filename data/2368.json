I saw someone on head-fi.org who bought one of these and used industrial strength velcro to attach one of these to their AD700s, so i decided to try it with my AKGs. It works pretty well, but the mic is real quiet right out of the box, but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to 10dB, it is super clear and crisp. If you put the mic boost up to 20dB you can hear large amounts of feedback (buzzing/humming noise), but that it not too big of a problem, because it works fine with a 10dB boost. I would recommend this to any gamer, but if you can spend a little more money, go for the ANT Lion Mod Mic V2.EDIT 10/8/13: I recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable, and has a volume control and mute button, and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback (buzzing/humming noise).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good for gaming", "unixReviewTime": 1378512000, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2013"}
