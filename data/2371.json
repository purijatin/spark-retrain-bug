It's ergonomic, it doesn't need to be cleaned very often, it's very precise (far more precise than the thumb-balls Logitech currently sells), it has four buttons assignable to just about any function... superior in every way.Recently I tried to buy another one for work but couldn't find anything like it.  If you can find one, buy it!  ...and make sure to register it so Logitech realizes it's still popular!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best, most ergonomic, most useful trackball...", "unixReviewTime": 1216771200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2008"}
