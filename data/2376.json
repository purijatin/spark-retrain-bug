I'm impressed at how the value of this mouse, used, has gone into the hundreds. Yet, I'm not surprised. This is an amazing trackball because it involves the movement of any 2 of the 3 leftmost fingers of the right hand. This means your hand won't get into repetitive motions that may cause permanent damage later on. I have been using this mouse for years and it's still going strong. You just have to clean the ball and lenses once in a while. My mouse is PS/2 but I am ordering a converter (PS/2 to USB). Many attempts to convert me to other models have failed. My hand is completely comfortable and the buttons fall naturally where the fingers rest. Truly perfect design. I just can't believe it has gone up in price over the years, yet I can understand why. A true investment in the health of your hand, fingers and wrist. Totally worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "King of the trackballs", "unixReviewTime": 1229558400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2008"}
