At this time I still have 3. Having tried just about every type and variation of input device on the planet, I never found any other mouse device the equal of the TMFT.Of course, being a 10 year old design, never updated, it lacks the buttons and scrolling abilities of modern mice. Which is too bad, because if Logitech revived this trackball, and updated it with 2 more buttons and new software, it would outsell everything else on the market by a wide margin.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the best after 10 years !", "unixReviewTime": 1186099200, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2007"}
