I work in a 3D cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day, every day.  This track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use, I find standard mice to be fatiguing.After more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me.  The switch still functions but the button has broken and does not move anymore.  I am very disapointed to find that logitech no longer makes this trackball, I will be replacing it with a used one from ebay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding, where can I buy another?", "unixReviewTime": 1148601600, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2006"}
