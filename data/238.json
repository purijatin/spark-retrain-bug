I have had problems with the browser since 2 weeks of owning and the Apps have issues loading and playing some games.  If I could, I would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "possible lemon", "unixReviewTime": 1336435200, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2012"}
