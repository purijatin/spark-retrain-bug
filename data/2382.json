I got them (headsets) only as an after-thought. The sensitivity settings on theradios (for head-set-use) for VOR use are a little touchy. I prefer using thePTT button WITH headsets connected... No breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter. Still, a good headset.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Work Perfect!", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}
