The headband is adjustable and very confortable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't do VOX with my FR50s (because the FR50 doesn't have VOX capability). Price is reasonable too. What more can I say about a simple headset?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Recommended accessory for FRS radios", "unixReviewTime": 991872000, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2001"}
