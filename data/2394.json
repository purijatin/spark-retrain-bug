As it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting.  Not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles.  The boom mic's sold by Motorola are perfect for this...static communications this set up is fine, hiking, skiing, something like that.  For the purpose that I purchased them for, awful...overall product though, good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not good for Motorcycles", "unixReviewTime": 1285718400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2010"}
