I don't understand people who expected this product to support VOX. It does not say anything about VOX in product description. I personally don't like VOX, because I don't want my children to hear what I'm saying when I fall down while skiing :-).Anyway the product is OK. The only problem for me is a very short wire, that's why I gave it 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good product. Short wire", "unixReviewTime": 1030320000, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2002"}
