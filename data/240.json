When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent tablet, great performance", "unixReviewTime": 1329264000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2012"}
