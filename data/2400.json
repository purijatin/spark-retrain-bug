Even a females voice, usually more clear than a males voice, is very hard to understand using the microphone. I have also not been able to get the iVox feature to work with this either.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very Garbled voice using the built-in Microphone", "unixReviewTime": 1402531200, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2014"}
