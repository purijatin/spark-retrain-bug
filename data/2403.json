Otherwise, the sound quality is good and the built-in mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack (meant for phone headsets, #43-2003) alleviates the cord problem, however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet, this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Recommended accessory for FRS radios", "unixReviewTime": 992217600, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2001"}
