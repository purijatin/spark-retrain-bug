Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these?  Or..  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer.  Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that.  Maybe a future feature.  Then again, if they can't make the cord 1 foot longer, I wouldn't expect any other luxuries.  Functionally seems fine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What's with the short cord", "unixReviewTime": 1211500800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2008"}
