Oshiro", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it.  I had to shut the radio off, then turn it back on again.  Just a slight movement from the male plug (that goes into the radio), would cause the radio to be unusable.I found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radio's headset socket.  The problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much, not allowing a good &#34;seat&#34;.  I used an Xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding, thus allowing a good &#34;seat&#34; of the male plug.  No more weird locking of the radio anymore.  I also had to do this with the other Motorola headsets that came with my Motorola Radios as well.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I had to modify the male plug for it to fit the Motorola radio", "unixReviewTime": 1356825600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2012"}
