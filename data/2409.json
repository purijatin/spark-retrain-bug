As someone who's been use to wearing the actual walkie talkie unit on his pants I had to begin to clip it on my shirts because the plug and its cord are short and tight. If I wear the walkie on my belt and have the speaker on my shoulder, the audio jack always pulls out of the walkie unit because of the tension.For my purposes these are not ideal and if you are use to wearing the walkie unit on your belt line then don't purchase these.If you're okay with wearing the walkie unit on your shirt or somewhere a lot higher than your belt line then go for it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not an ideal speaker for Walkie units worn on belt lines.", "unixReviewTime": 1383868800, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2013"}
