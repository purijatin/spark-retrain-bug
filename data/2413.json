Our crew prefers using these in the attics instead of pulling the walkies out of their pocket or belt clips.Speaker:- When you plug in the microphone the sound you hear come out of the mic- When you press the transmit button on the mic or the radio the microphone acts like a microphone.- Sound quality is nice- Volume is adjustable by volume control on radioCord:- My main gripe is the cord- The coiled cord on the new mics are tight from waist to shoulder- By stretching the coil out this problem goes away. Almost wish that the cord came pre-stretched so the new cords weren't so tight.Clip:- The clip clips at the top of the mic.- It would have been better if the clip swiveled on the back of the mic as everyone doesn't like to clip the mic on their shoulder lapel or collar. I prefer the mic in front of me and being able to swivel the clip would have been a major plus.Quality:- The mics are high quality and work well.  Out of the 8 I ordered I only had to return 1 due to failure right out of the package.Overall, great mics at a descent price.  At first the cord will be annoying but with time it should stretch and work better on adults. May look a little funny though if all your kids had these mics on their shoulders. People may give you strange looks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Mics", "unixReviewTime": 1341878400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2012"}
