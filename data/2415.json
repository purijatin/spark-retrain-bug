Cencioso \"Father Figure\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The mic works well, and has a built in speaker, so you can have the audio feed close at hand.Sadly, the cord is so taught and tightly wound, there is no possible way to have the radio at waist level and the mic at shoulder level.  After months of trying to stretch the cord, it remains as short and tight as the day I received it.  When it was attached at shoulder level, the radio often jumped off of my belt (and survives only because the cable did not detach, and the radio did not ever strike the ground).  I have been relegated to attaching the Mic to my tie at about sternum level, which works but requires a higher audio level output than if it were on my shoulder near my ear.I give it four stars because it does what it says it will do, keeps me from having to constantly remove and replace my radio (and also, because after my repeated stretching attempts, the cord has not shorted out... no small feat).I truly wish it were more flexible or longer, but I guess it does the job.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does the job, mostly", "unixReviewTime": 1363996800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2013"}
