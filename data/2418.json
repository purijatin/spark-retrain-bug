You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "very dissappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2012"}
