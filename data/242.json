You have less control of this thing than you would your TV.The root kits are useless for this OS version 1.4.2 and the instructions to root / jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks !It is an overpriced Barnes & Noble franchise in your dumb little hands and you're well served keeping your receipt and refunding it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This thing is a junk kids toy.", "unixReviewTime": 1332547200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2012"}
