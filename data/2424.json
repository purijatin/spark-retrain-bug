I'm a first responder so I was interested in getting something like what I have at work for my family radios. The mic is VERY sensitive, so have it about 6-12\" away from your mouth and talk normally... they will hear you fine.  The weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what I have at work. I can tell that this is a Motorola product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Motorola Quality for everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1307923200, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2011"}
