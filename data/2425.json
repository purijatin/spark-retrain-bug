I have the MR350R waterproof version and the remote speaker is pretty close to the quality of the handhelds speaker.  The remote speaker does have a bit more treble to it but not bad enough to where its a problem.Durability:The plastic housing isn't the thickest, but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement.  The feels very sturdy and durable.  Only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel.  Some may want this but if it weren't as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be better.!!!UPDATE!!!I used this remote speaker mic for 5 days while snowboarding.  I wore it on the strap of the backpack where it was exposed to snow and cold constantly.  I'm not the best snowboarder so I was in the snow all over the place.  The mic isn't labeled as water proof or even weather resistant but it definitely got wet and still works like a charm.  The clip was strong enough and never fell off of the strap even after all of my spills.  I love this thing and want to use it every chance I get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality Remote Speaker Mic", "unixReviewTime": 1357689600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2013"}
