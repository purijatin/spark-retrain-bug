Hayes \"Sylvia Hayes\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have only had it about a week, but I needed it to use with my Motorola Walkie Talkie.  I walk about 2 miles a day even in the the cold weather we had this season.  My radio kept dieing out when I tried to use it to talk to my husband on my walk from home to a high school on the other side of I96 here in Redford, MI.  The cold was a major factor and I tried insulating the radio but it still was dieing out a few days after recharging my batteries.  I could have recharged the batteries every couple of days that would have helped, but I try to let them run down before charging.  Plus pushing the button is cumbersome with a hand that has to have both a glove and a mitten on to keep reasonably warm.  I did buy another small set that had an earphone, but the sound was not loud enough, I may have dome some damage to that set that caused that problem, don't know, but needed to try something a little more workable so we bought this, and I clip it on the pocket just below my collar and put the radio inside my coat which is in the middle of the coat above my waist.  So I was able to find a good position for everything and so far this has been my best solution. I will probably even use it in the summer because of the ease of use.  My husbands voice comes in loud and clear and it is minimum inconvenience to push the button even with a double protected hand.  The button is longer than the one with the earphone, it works great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "looks very promising", "unixReviewTime": 1393113600, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2014"}
