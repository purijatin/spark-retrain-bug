I use it on an older Motorola T5500 radio.  The mic comes with a strong metal clip to attach to your clothing or belt.  The speaker sound quality and volume is very good and the PPT button on the mic is easy to use.  The connector is a press fit so if the cord is stretched too far the connector may disconnect.  A small \"tie wrap\" wrapped around the cord and the radio antenna will solve this issue.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Motorola 53724 Remote Speaker Mic", "unixReviewTime": 1338595200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2012"}
