They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.If we hold one of the the Sony cassettes next to a TDK cassette (which work fine in the BM-575) the tape in these Sony cassettes looks visibly taller.Unfortunately we are stuck with about 30 3-packs now.  I do not recommend this seller or these tapes.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Seem to be non-standard knockoff cassettes", "unixReviewTime": 1385078400, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2013"}
