It was slightly larger but, not having the elastic top, simply spilled things if you filled it up. The velcro on the bottom also wasn't \"fold-over\" like this. Not that I intend to try myself, but I've seen liquid poured into these with little to NO leakage! That's wonderful! Heaven forbid the idiot in the back seat throws an ALMOST empty soda in upside down! lol I also got some comparably sized trash bag inserts that are held in by the elastic top band nicely! This prevents ANY spilling and makes for easy disposal! Tie the top, unvelcro the bottom, and slide out your sealed trash bag! Works MUCH better than my plastic grocery bag hanging off one side of the shifter! (also doesn't take up leg room in the passenger seat!)Excellent product, especially from the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little trash bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1308182400, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2011"}
