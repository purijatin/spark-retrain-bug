This one totally puts that bag to shame, as lame as that may sound. The elastic top keeps the trash in, and the rolled bottom makes releasing the trash very easy. I appreciate the way that it hangs as well, keeping its top frame from being too cumbersome and taking away any of my valuable space inside my compact car. Great purchase, and for a killer price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great auto trash bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1276128000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2010"}
