Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks, which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though, it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly (make sure to check out the dimensions), and it is not always easy to empty out.  The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well, just if it is really full, you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it.  This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor, and I am very happy with the purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good car trash bag with a couple minor cons", "unixReviewTime": 1327017600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2012"}
