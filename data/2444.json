This one is unobtrusive so it doesn't detract from the looks of my interior.  Because it has a cinch top rather than a flap, it is easy to drop things into it without being distracted.  This is my favorite feature...  the hole is big enough to put things in but small enough to keep them there.  The small piece of velcro keeps it affixed.  My former bag had a long piece and I didn't want to stick that to my nice car....  It empties easily.Really, this does the trick.  I resisted crapping up my car with a trash bag for so long... but realized I was crapping up my car with wrappers and other misc trash.  This is really good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fantastic - does the trick", "unixReviewTime": 1315008000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2011"}
