The case is plastic, and not particularly good plastic at that.  The seams between the front and back halves of the case don't fit together well, leaving an unpleasant sharp edge.  The leather cover is nice, and, unlike the plastic case, gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180, or there abouts.I bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio.  However, in reality it's much larger and heavier than I expected.The above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality.  Both are extremely poor.  This radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations, and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'.  I don't live in an area with great radio reception; however, my Boston Acoustics Receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations.  If the Grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of 3 stations.  Short wave is basically worthless on this radio (as is the AM band).For $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy.  There are much better radios for the same price, or significantly less.  The leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness.  In its absence, this radio would be worth $20, at the very most.Bottom line - This radio looks really nice in photos, but dissapoints in reality (both in terms of fit and finish, and tuner quality).", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not quite what I expected", "unixReviewTime": 1161907200, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2006"}
