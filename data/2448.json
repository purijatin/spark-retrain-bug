To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful!  They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "DECEITFUL SELLERS = JR MUSIC & Amazon", "unixReviewTime": 1169078400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2007"}
