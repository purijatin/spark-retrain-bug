The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Save your money!", "unixReviewTime": 1172448000, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2007"}
