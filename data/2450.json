For the most part I've been really happy for many years. Its great for a simple transistor radio type sound quality. I am not a short-wave person so I cannnot comment on that feature. FM and AM reception are terrific in Orlando. Battery life is great too. I have had 3 of these over 12 years.The first model was used reliably for 8 years. 5 of those years were in the bathroom exclusively. I finally wore out its AM/FM/SW selector by sliding it back and forth between AM Talk and FM stations daily 10s of times. At that point I bought a second.This second model had suede inside its leather cover and a cheap shinyish silver finish. The buttons felt cheap and it ran for about 4 months and completely died, no audio, no readout, dead. The model appeared to be the same but quality was aweful compared to what I had before.I then sought an older, smooth leather interior covered model through ebay. It has functioned perfectly for the last few years on a high humidity bath windowsill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One Version Great, One Terrible", "unixReviewTime": 1333324800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2012"}
