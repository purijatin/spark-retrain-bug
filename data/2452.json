I wasn't even shopping for one.  I grabbed it in a bargain bin for $25 since it had no box, no manual, no accessories, and was a display model, although it spent its time behind a case.Unimpressive performance with very poor signal resolution, awkward volume control which forces you to open the leatherette case to get to this slide control (DUMB!).  I've stacked it up to both more expensive radios that I own and less expensive ones (CCRadio2, Kaito KA009S, Radio Shack Optimus PLL 12-808, Midland ER102MO, two table radios - Bose Wave Radio, and Kloss Tweeter label).  It comes in last every time.For local powerful radio stations it works fine (but then so does a crystal radio with a short antenna...) challenge it a bit and its good looks get annoying really fast.  Use it for shortwave and you will find yourself shopping for something, anything that can pick up any but the most obvious and strong SW transmissions.  If I had paid any more for it, I would consider it to be as valuable as an old brick.Reviews on [...], a site dedicated to DXing and Ham radio operators, place this unit dead last amongst the significant numbers of receivers reviewed.  (1.8 points out of 5)Stay away unless you can get it for a few bucks used or on clearance and already know that what you are going to listen to is AM, powerful, and not likely to challenge the tuner end.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Barely satisfied but only due to the low purchase price!", "unixReviewTime": 1250640000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2009"}
