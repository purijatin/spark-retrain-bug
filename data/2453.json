I have a large collection of radios . Grundig over the years has made many good products ,however , the G2000a is certainly not one of them . I will concur that it is beautifully designed ,has nice leather case and the FM section sounds decent . The AM and SW sections are practically useless . Lots of interference and noise . Only can pick up strong signals and I have experienced fading on those stations . DXers should pass it by!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not the best from Grundig", "unixReviewTime": 1066348800, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2003"}
