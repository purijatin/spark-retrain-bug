It pulls in stations from all over the globe 24 hours a day.  It is easy to use and extremely reliable.  I recently took it to Mexico with me so I could keep up on U.S. news and it provided me with several U.S. broadcasts.  I love this radio.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome radio", "unixReviewTime": 1113091200, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2005"}
