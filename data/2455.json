Both have their advantages and it is up to the user what is most important. The Grundig YB-400 is a  fairly easy to use radio that allows the user to punch in the desired  frequency, enter it into one of 40 memories, or scan desired bands to find  a station of interest. The Grundig's best asset is its great audio. It is  definitely the best audio I've heard from a shortwave portable and makes  listening a real pleasure. If you live or travel to any part of the world  other than Europe or eastern North America the Grundig YB-400 is the best  you can buy. If you live in one of those two places consider the Sony,  which has a synch. detector that allows you to reduce interference from  adjacent stations. This is important in areas where there are a high number  of strong stations crowded next to one another. In any case, both are well  worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A portable with full size sound.", "unixReviewTime": 945129600, "reviewTime": "12 14, 1999"}
