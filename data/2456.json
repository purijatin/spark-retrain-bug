Stone", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I've been collecting radios for a couple of years now, and own over 75 (at last count).  They range from old tube-type AM table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest.  Let me tell you what I think about the Grundig YB400-PE:Strong points:1)  Solid-feeling quality.  It doesn't feel cheap when you pick it up.2)  Good sensitivity across all bands.3)  Nice, full sound from the internal speaker.4)  Accessory package includes a good quality soft case, AC adaptor, bud-type earphones, and 23' compact SW antenna5)  The ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a hard-to-tune station.Not-so-strong points:1)  Only 40 presets.  I don't need 200, but it would be nice to be able to separate them into \"folders\" for AM, FM, SW.2)  Battery life is acceptable, but definitely not exceptional.  I usually plug in the AC adaptor because of this.3)  I wish it had a rotary tuning and tone (bass/treble) knobs.  Why?  I just like them.4)  The backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of LED'sI know a lot of people find SSB reception to be important, but I rarely use it.  As often as not, I like to just tune around the SW bands at night and see what I can find.  Sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the US.I'm a radio fan, not a radio geek.  I just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good.  If you're like me, I'll bet you'll like this radio.  If you're a geek, you may have more bones to pick with it, but on that I really cannot comment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Lot of Bang-for-the-Buck", "unixReviewTime": 1118880000, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2005"}
