Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one! Why not? The hi/low switch is better than nothing,and does an ok job.-No rf gain control.Two way dx/local switch only-no tune knob just up and down buttons,so it's a bit of a pain to band scan.Push push push push push push push.Can tune in 1 KHz steps.-BFO only. No usb/lsb.Tunes in 1 Khz steps with bfo \"fine tune\" knob.Still ok for ssb ,just could be better.-no sync detector.Hay,what do 'ya want for that price ?-Cheezy \"earbud phones\". Then again, did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything? Not me.Spend a little and get some Koss \"Porta-pro\" phones.You will never go back to cheap ones again!-dial light only stays on for 10 sec.Don't let all of this talk you out of one though.What it does it does well....All in all: A fine little radio esp. for the $. Quite good sound with the speaker,and very very good through phones.Good MW/Am dx( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but,still a lot better than you might think).Good with just the whip ant. for SW.Very good FM.I think it's by far the best radio you can get for the money....grab one while you can still get a new one....8)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A much better radio than I thought it would be.", "unixReviewTime": 1097020800, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2004"}
