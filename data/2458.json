It is portable and fits very ergonomically friendly into you hands. There are 40 memory presets. The BIG shortwave broadcasts (BBC, Radio Canada, Voice of America) came in very clear and those are really the only ones worth listening to on a regular basis as most of shortwave is flooded with religious programming and politically slanted news.  FM reception is very good and AM is about as good as my other radios. The dial light and LCD readout could be stronger and bigger. It comes with an adaptor. Sleep timer and alarm works just fine. Has two times (for GMT/UTC and local time). It looks great with its platinum case. I highly recommend this. It costs more but if you love radio and want BBC and VOA, this is the one to get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great radio", "unixReviewTime": 1073692800, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2004"}
