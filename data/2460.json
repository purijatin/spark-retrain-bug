I use a Sony SW7600G (black version) as a clock radio because it only has 10 presets per band.  It's how you switch the stations that's important and the YB400PE requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stations--if the memory preset is two digits, why do you have to press enter?  The Sony takes one keystroke (granted, though, the new silver-colored Sony doesn't do this either).  Surely if you're looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful, but the frequencies change so much I always use the WRTH and PTWBR books and never use the presets.The sound is much, much better than the Sony.  It has deep bass and clear sound for both speech and music.Aside from choosing memory presets, this radio would be more perfect if it had synchronous detection where the carrier is discarded and a sideband is used for better audio.  The Sony has this and it completely removes interference form RFI sources like computers and fluorescent lamps.Bandscanning is okay if you don't mind the muting every time the frequency changes (some people call this \"chuffing\").  The automatic seek stops on the noisiest frequency, not just one with a carrier.The radio is made in China and has been re-branded as Eton recently.  I have one of the pre-Eton Chinese-made models but I wonder how much better the old Taiwanese version was.***EDIT*** After about four years of daily use the sound has finally deteriorated.  I notice that after about two hours' operation something overheats and the sound becomes muddy and distorted.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic sound.
