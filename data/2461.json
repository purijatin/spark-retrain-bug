My father bought a new YB400 for me for a graduation present in 1995.  I have never been able to pick up any SW station. I am in Colorado now, 100km away from the high power time stations, and I can't pick them up.  Just hear buzzing noises.  Nothing on LW either.  AM (MW) reception is poor but it does get some stations.  This was really expensive to turn out to be an FM clock radio.  The FM reception is good, the clock works fine, the light is nice.  Equivelent to a nice $20 radio for 8 times the price.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Good FM clock radio, very bad SW receiver", "unixReviewTime": 1193443200, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2007"}
