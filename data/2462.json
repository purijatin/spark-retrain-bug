It has worked well and has good sound quality as well as very decent shortwave performance for the price.Pros: Great value for price and I recommend the purchase if you want a good shortwave radio with stereo FM capability.  The cons which follow would not prevent me from making this purchase again.Cons: The packaging is (injection molding plastic fit/finish and design) is poor and much like a product that costs $20.  It has not failed but just leaves a bad taste compared with Japanese competition.  What is worse is the legend for the features that one would use in low light conditions such as alarm is medium blue against black, small letters.  They can't be read easily in normal light, much less normal household lighting.  The logic is typically German...like my 2 VWs...they seem to do things in a way that is different from anyone else and thus it is not intuitive without reading the manual...again, if it is a seldom used feature.  Also, a tone control instead of a switch would have been nice as well a ability to charge batteries while plugged in.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Electronics Value - some bad packaging design", "unixReviewTime": 1118016000, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2005"}
