JEFFREY MCMAHON \"herculodge\"", "helpful": [20, 23], "reviewtext": "I've had the opportunity to compare the Grundig YB400PE to several premium radios, the Tivoli PAL, the Sony ICF SW35, the Grundig S35, the Sangean 505, and the Kaito 1102. How does it rank? It ties for second with the aforementioned radios for FM. First place goes to the Kaito 1102. For AM, it takes a tie for last place with the Sangean 505. Even the reception strength meter shows a weak signal for 790 AM, a major Los Angeles station. In contrast, my Kaito 1102's meter shows \"full strength\" in its signal. And you can hear a HUGE difference too. The YB 400 does have a good speaker, clear and adequate for a radio its size, but it's not exceptional. I'd give the nod to the Kaito 1102. Since the Kaito 1102 is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the YB400, I say it's a no brainer: Get the Kaito 1102.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Radio with One Glaring Weakness", "unixReviewTime": 1097798400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2004"}
