You can't go wrong with either one.The YB400 audio  is much better than the Sony, and the operation is easier than the  Sony.The interference rejection however is better in the Sony because of  the Sony's synch detector, if interference of strong stations is a  consideration, or if ``selective fading,'' common on shortwave or twilight  AM broadcasting, where the carrier fades below the sidebands causing  distortion, is a problem.  This is also solved by synch detection.If  distance daytime AM listening is desired, the Sony with its fast AGC is  better than the YB400 with its slow AGC, because you can add a MW loop  (Select-a-tenna, Terk Loop, or Radio Shack MW loop) and tune it  successfully with a fast AGC.  It's difficult to tune with the YB400's slow  AGC, though sometimes you can turn the switch to local and disable the AGC  temporarily to do it.(Slow AGC gives you an edge in copying interfering  morse code stations, however, because the louder station won't modulate the  weaker one on the YB400, and it will on the Sony.)For strong stations,  pick the YB400 for the audio. For interference or AM distance listening  with a MW loop, pick the Sony.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Shortwave Receiver", "unixReviewTime": 949881600, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2000"}
