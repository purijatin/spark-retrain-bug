Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good.  You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators.  Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to.  With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved.  It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna.  It also has AM and FM reception.  FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality.  It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling.  This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice radio", "unixReviewTime": 1041206400, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2002"}
