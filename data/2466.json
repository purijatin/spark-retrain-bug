The F.M. and A.M. both have great sensitivity and selectivity; the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones. The only reason I don't give this radio 5 stars is because of the telescoping antenna. I've been through 5 radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use. Other than that this would be a perfect radio.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Portable With Excellant Reception!", "unixReviewTime": 1127260800, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2005"}
