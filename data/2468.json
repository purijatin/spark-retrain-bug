That being said the YB 400 PE is the best SW I've ever had. This Grundig brings a lot of features to the table such as digital tuning, forty presets, great capture of stations and above average sound. I've really enjoyed using the 400 and its great features.One complaint I had was that the manual that accompanies it does an inadequate job of explaining some of the functions and the pre-sets are all inclusive, that is it's forty pre-sets for all bands FM/SW/LW/MW rather than per band. But these are small things that shouldn't take away from the overall excellence of the radio.I'm getting ready to go on an extended trip to the third world and the Grundig YB 400PE is at the top of my packing list.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best shortwave I've owned", "unixReviewTime": 1045267200, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2003"}
