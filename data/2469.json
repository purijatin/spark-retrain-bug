Locke", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Briefly, the FM and AM reception are very good for the Grundig YB 400PE radio. SW is decent and SSB is fair, at best. The controls and display for the Grundig are good, too: ergonomically, the choices made by Grundig were sound and better than much of the competition. Which is to say, the buttons and controls are easy to master in comparison to similar Kaito and Sony models. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a better unit, I have to say, but the audio on the Grundig is much preferable to the Sony. Overall, I would take the Sony, but the Grundig is a good portable radio and I would not be disappointed if I were on a desert island with just a Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE as company. Well done.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1298246400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011"}
