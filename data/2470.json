Got rave reviews of the images shared.  The USB connection is easy and fast.  I found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution.It has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots, including some sky photography  (sunsets) that rival film versions.One does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures, maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash card.It came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature.  And the Amazon price  is at least $100 less than any other source!This would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography, who wants a  camera that looks, feels,  and acts like a familiar 35 mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome value - very user friendly", "unixReviewTime": 962841600, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2000"}
