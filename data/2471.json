Johnson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This was my first and only digital camera that I purchased as a display item will I was working at CompUSA. If I remember correctly, at the time this camera was over $300 but I got it for $50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it, but despite that, it lasted an additional 3 1/2 years before it stopped working; the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me, it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times, but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera, not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it, and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise, I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this, instead they make these plastic, cheap looking, cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera. To this day the DC240 has been my only digital camera and I haven't had one since. I will have to turn to EBAY to get something from the DC series, because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used to.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Only wish they still made them like this...", "unixReviewTime": 1106524800, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2005"}
