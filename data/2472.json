It was easy to get started with it. Do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag.  I highly recommend the USB disk reader, makes things a lot easier. With that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your TV. Note that the Kodak 280 is offered here... [it] is probably more value. But, you will have to buy accessories so [it] will become a bit more after its all done. I can't say too much about how the pics print because I have been using it exclusively for Internet images. I am having fun with mine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Kodak 240", "unixReviewTime": 971222400, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2000"}
