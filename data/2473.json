I had read reviews of the Kodak digital cameras and decided to check the price on Amazon -- which was  about right.  The camera came a few days before I went to a convention in  Philadelphia, giving me enough time to learn how to use the camera.The  pictures are wonderful, and my collegues were amazed that I could show them  the pictures immediately, or delete them if the shot was bad.  I also did a  few shots using the timer, which worked pretty well.  Following the  convention, I was able to put together a quick web site with the pictures,  a faster process than waiting for the film to be developed, then scanning  the pictures, then cropping, etc.Overall, a good combination of  features, ease of use, and quality pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good bang for the buck", "unixReviewTime": 964656000, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2000"}
