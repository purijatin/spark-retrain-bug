I would highly recommend getting a Compact Flash Card Reader, so you don't drain your batteries on the camera xfering. Also the Kodak Batteries are the best I have ever used. I would recommended getting the 2 hour rapid charger kit, you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Camera, Great Features, Easy Use", "unixReviewTime": 969580800, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2000"}
