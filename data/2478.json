Hall", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewtext": "If you're not used to working with wires and lengths, I'd suggest measuring something and testing it out on your setup. Even at 3 feet it seemed shorter than I thought it would be. Luckily my computer sits right next to my router so I didn't have issues there. It was great to move away from my previous wireless connection to a wired connect. Also makes it easier to troubleshoot the network when it's acting buggy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Short cord, perfect for my setup", "unixReviewTime": 1382572800, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2013"}
