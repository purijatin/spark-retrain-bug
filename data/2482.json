This shorter one was exactly what I needed for the space in which it is being used.I don't know what else to really say about this, or any of the MANY Belkin cables I have bought from Amazon, except that they work very well for my requirements. This specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box. It did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way, but it's been fine for my use of it. Some people think they are not the best of quality but I have not ever had any go \"bad\" or break or not fit correctly. You *can* get cables even cheaper than these from Belkin, but I don't trust them... the Belkin cables here on Amazon are still FAR cheaper than what I have seen in stores, and I refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like this!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works as expected", "unixReviewTime": 1306886400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2011"}
