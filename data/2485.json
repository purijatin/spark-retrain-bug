Wanted a reliable brand name (Belkin) cord with quality connectors.  This one looks well built. Only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e (350 speed) vs cat 6 (500 speed).  Didn't see a 3 foot one in Cat 6 but the price for the Cat 5e was very fair.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good quality short ethernet Cat 5e cord", "unixReviewTime": 1316131200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2011"}
