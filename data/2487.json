Connectors fit fine with reliable connections. Have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems. This was important as I've had the plastic latch fail on other CAT5 cables from plugging / unplugging.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rugged and best length for my needs", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}
