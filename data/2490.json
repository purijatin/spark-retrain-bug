I used this short cable to connect an Apple TV directly to router. I try to avoid wireless when I can, but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center. The texture of the cable's insulation, coupled with the cable's supple flexibility, made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled mess.The connection is solid and secure, and the locking tab on the connector has a shield to help prevent accidental disconnections. I have had no troubles with the quality of the connection, and the Apple TV transmits a high-definition signal every time.At this price, the cable is a bargain. For some reason, I've seen CAT 5 cable of this length sell for more than $25.00 in brick-and-mortar stores (and one time I had to pay the extortionate price because I was in a pinch).You can purchase this cable secure in the knowledge that you're going to get a quality product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's been snagless and it has worked well for me.
