I have a small switch where I connect two laptops and one Raspberry Pi, and long cables would make too much clutter. These cables work perfectly fine in my 100Mbit network, and should also work witn a Gigabit network (not tested). Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple working cables", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}
