I was looking for CAT 5e cables to replace my older cables and decided based on the reviews on Amazon and the price that this would be a great purchase. I don't regret it. The cable is of good quality and the cables-as advertised-are completely snagless; so much so, that it'll take you a couple seconds longer to unplug the cord from whatever peripheral or computer it's hooked into. This was actually frustrating for me when I was troubleshooting my router, but then became a plus when I realized how easily the other cable would come undone with just moderate tension on the cord. So, the snagless is great if you plan on leaving it hooked into one device for any extended length of time, but not so great if you plan on constantly hooking and unhooking it from your device (in this case, it's probably more convenient to get a \"snagging\" one. Otherwise known as...a regular RJ45 cable). I can imagine someone with a laptop using a wired internet connection fussing over this feature.  Oh yeah, the length of this cord is a beautiful thing. I got so tired of having all this excess cord hanging out the back of my devices that I was thrilled when I discovered this on Amazon. I had no idea they made the lengths of the cord this short, so, that was actually the deciding factor for me. I'm happy with this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Snagless is right.", "unixReviewTime": 1300492800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2011"}
