Purchased these to replace the 25 foot Ethernet cables taking up all the space in my computer room. Using these nice short cables, I connected my routers and modem all together much more neatly than I had done using the longer cables.Bottom line: these work as they should. Been using them for about a year with absolutely no problems or complaints.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Short, simple, sweet", "unixReviewTime": 1373155200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2013"}
