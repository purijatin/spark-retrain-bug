It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it.  If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect.  I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin.  It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient.  Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable; however, when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "All Factors GO", "unixReviewTime": 1271808000, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2010"}
