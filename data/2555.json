I bought this to connect my Roku box to my router since they are only about 2 feet apart.Its thin and not the best quality, but it works great. Snagless means that the ends are protected from being snapped offwhile feeding the cord through holes or openings in your desk or entertainment center. IT WORKS...and well thats what matters most. So my opinion, to run an ethernet cord to a short distance, you can't get a better value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works and thats what matters...", "unixReviewTime": 1355529600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2012"}
