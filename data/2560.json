The twisty ties were twisty and tied.  The clips on both ends clipped properly. It did not break the first time I used it.  It didn't break when I had to unplug and re-plug it.  It fits most brands of cable management systems.  And data flows through it nicely.I love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It is a length of blue CAT 5 cable", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014"}
