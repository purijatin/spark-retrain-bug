Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just what I'd hoped", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2013"}
