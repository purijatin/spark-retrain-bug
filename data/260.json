Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your $200 on a real tablet.By the way, not a slap at Amazon, just the tablet itself.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not a Real Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1350086400, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2012"}
