I have, unfortunately, shelled out $20 for a 20 foot Ethernet in the past thinking it was the price I had to pay. Either this price is outrageous or the sellers online are crazy.After buying a switch for my college dorm room I needed an extra Ethernet cord. Since the switch box was about a foot from the Ethernet plug I needed a small length, and 3 feet seemed adequate.This light blue cord is exactly what I needed and is listed at an exceptional $2.75. With Amazon Prime this is like spending the quarters you find in your couch cushions.I always recommend buying Ethernet cords (or 90% of products) online. The deals are too good to pass up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheapest Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1330387200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2012"}
