I was so impressed with the make and quality of it that when I bought a Valet router, I decided the cat 5 cable supplied with it was not up to the standard I expected. I bought the 3 foot one to connect my router to the modem. I really wasn't expecting much as far as improved performance, but I am keeping a full wifi signal on my phone now, while previously only having 2 of 3 bars showing up. Could be the shorter cord, could be better quality, I'm not really one to say since I'm no pro with these things, but it has improved my router's signal. One piece of advice, if you're using more than one get a different color. I wasn't thinking and prefer the blue cord, so I ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product. Since I do occasionally plug my modem directly into the PC instead of through the router, I ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so I know which is which. The snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern I had with the cable that came with the router since I could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging. Wouldn't usually write a review for a cord, but this one has enough going for it that I think it deserves all the praise it can get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better router connection", "unixReviewTime": 1329868800, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2012"}
