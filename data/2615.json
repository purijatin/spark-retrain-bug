My only complaint is that the orange isn't quite as festive in person. I thought it would be more neon, but it's actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords. Orange is my favorite color, so I paid a little extra for it, but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works Great - Orange Color is Ugly", "unixReviewTime": 1380412800, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2013"}
