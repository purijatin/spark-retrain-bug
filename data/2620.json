I found these cables on here at what I thought was a ridiculous price, and though the price made me wonder would the things even work when I got then, I should never have worried.  They worked like a charm.For someone like me who isn't going to buy a roll of CAT cable at home depot and make my own network lines, these worked great.Highly recommend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheap and They Work!", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2014"}
