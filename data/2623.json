I am happy to report that it was in fact 3 feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer.  The price was great the big box store wanted $25 for a 6 foot cord.This is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture.  I recommend the product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for My Needs", "unixReviewTime": 1320364800, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2011"}
