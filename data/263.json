It excels at eBook reading, and has many functions as a tablet as well.  This is a minor upgrade for Nook Color owners, but a major upgrade for those going from the Nook or Kindle eInk display reader.Pros:7\" VividView IPS touchscreen, bonded for glare reduction.  This is the best IPS screen on the market in this class of device.MicroSD card slot, for up to 32GB of extra storage.Built-in Microphone for voice recording, particularly usefull to \"read\" books to your children without having to physically be there.Reliable Wifi card.1 GB built in RAM for smooth, fast video.Netflix and Hulu.eReader bests the competitions.Easy to root, if that is something you would do.Cons:It's $50 more than some low end hybrids.Much like the other low end tablet's, it runs on Android, which is not the best tablet experience.Limited apps, although the list expands almost daily.Overall, this is a great device and although it is $50 more than some of the competitors models, it is also a far more refined product which doesn't have many of the problems of the others.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nook Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1322697600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2011"}
