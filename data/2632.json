Certainly pricey for what it is, but the snagless design is very solid and you won't have to worry about bad cables, as these are all pre-checked for you.One small quibble is that the snagless housing makes for a big cable end, which could become problematic if you are plugging many cables into a small hub. Otherwise, great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High quality cable, but you might want to roll your own", "unixReviewTime": 1343606400, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2012"}
