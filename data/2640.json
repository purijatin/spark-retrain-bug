Was able to run it from the router, through a floor hole, across the basement, and up through a hole near the additional PC with no kinks, twists, snags or curls. The PVC jacket is solid and thick for excellent protection and yet the cable remains flexible so I was able to bend it through some pretty tight spaces.Big plus: the strain relief on the RJ-45 plug helps protect the locking tab from snapping off. The plugs fit into the jacks with barely any wiggle so it makes solid contact. (And I've had some bad experiences with cheapo ill-fitting RJ-45 plugs from other sources. I'm looking at you, Radio Shack.)I like this cable and highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yep, this is the best LAN cable", "unixReviewTime": 1376092800, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2013"}
