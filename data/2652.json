CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough --- as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable.  The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but (like other reviewers stated) the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product --- I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not Sure About this Product.", "unixReviewTime": 1388448000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2013"}
