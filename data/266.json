The best I used was the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus. This is a less expensive tablet and very, very good. But rooting the Nook Tablet made it great.That is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading. There are step-by-step videos on how to do this and links to necessary files. All you need to get you started is Google \"root Nook Tablet\". Yes, when it is rooted it does void the Nook Tablet warranty, but it can be unrooted without problems.The screen is beautiful, it is fast and with the micro SD card slot, has plenty of room for storage. I bought my 16gb for $229. A great tablet for the price and I use it every day. Great purchase.The Galaxy Tabs are noted for audio quality and, of course, have some features that can be useful. But the Nook Tablet is mighty fine and a great investment for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nook Tablet -- Rooted", "unixReviewTime": 1336348800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2012"}
