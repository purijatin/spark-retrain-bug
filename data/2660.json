I bought this cable anyway.  I used the cable for three weeks.  I removed the cable after three weeks.  JUNK AFTER THREE WEEKS.All those who say 5-star -- maybe they only used it for a day.  After they got paid for writing a glowing review, they junked it after 1 week. Plan to junk yours too. Hey, it is only your hard earned money. So what?I cannot tell you how much it HURTS ME to write such a poor review.  Dam you, BELKIN.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not the same Belkin, now MADE IN CHINA", "unixReviewTime": 1366243200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2013"}
