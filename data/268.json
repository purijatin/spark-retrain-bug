If you want a tablet, get a tablet. There are far better options for a similar price. If all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps, fine. But this thing is truly lacking. I've owned mine for 6 months, and haven't changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE: The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge, ever, and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps, closes them, types things into the browser, and won't let you use the tablet at all. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is unacceptable. 15% should still be enough to read for a bit, rather than going psycho and taking over the device.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Nothing Special", "unixReviewTime": 1356393600, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2012"}
