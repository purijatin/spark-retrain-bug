I didn't realize until I received the cable that the fastening posts actually prevented the cable from connecting because any VGA outlet would not accommodate that. I decided to take my chances with a hack saw and successfully (and easily) removed the posts from the female end. The posts are only needed if using as an actual extension to prevent the cables from being pulled apart. It worked great for my application.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good cable, used for VGA extender", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2014"}
