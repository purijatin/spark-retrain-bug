In this review I was asked to rate 1-5 stars on this product's ease of use and sound quality - i have no idea why, as this is strictly a visual product.Anyway - I use this male to female VGA monitor extension cable to extend another 15' VGA cable which connects my laptop to my 46\" LCD TV. I would say I am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio/video quality and still feel the picture is nearly PERFECT. It does what it is supposed to, without any detectable degrading to the image quality or \"noise.\" The build feels solid and at the same time, not too rigid. I am very happy with this product.*UPDATE:This and the other cable I bought at the same time, 2.5 years ago, both seem to be working well. Neither has seen heavy abuse, so I can't attest to it's road-worthiness, but in my home it still carries a strong, clear signal!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "*UPDATE: great Male to Female VGA extension cable", "unixReviewTime": 1268092800, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2010"}
