Cables to Routers.  I've never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably.  This cable is another one of those products.  A simple product (VGA Extension Cord) - but it needs to work reliably.  This cable was nearly the least expensive one available - and it works well / as expected with higher resolution.  I'd buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorse.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brand Name Quality - Discount Price", "unixReviewTime": 1317945600, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2011"}
