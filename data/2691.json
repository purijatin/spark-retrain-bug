I needed to connect my ancient (but under-used) HP Laser Jet-II printer to my \"modern\" computers (that still have a parallel port).  I'd considered using a USB-to-parallel cord, or a USB-to-parallel adapter (converter), but some of these have hit-or-miss reviews on this site, so I decided to go with this \"older\" solution.  [Rare mention of a LJ-II out there, too!]  The result is, I can now use the LJ-II (which still works splendidly) with either of 2 desktops, or with my Windows XP laptop.  The proper drivers install quickly, and printing seems quick enough.-- IN SHORT:  RECOMMENDED.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well made and itworked!
