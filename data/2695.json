Unlike some 3 or 5-piece systems, the PC Works bass unit is shielded, in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor.Cons: though it seems a bit silly  to complain that a $50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound  reproduction -- heck, I've spent far more than that on speaker wire -- the  &quot;subwoofer&quot; in this set is not really a subwoofer at all.  It's a  woofer, and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response.  Still, the sound  is fine for games and most Internet music content.As long as you  aren't expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers --  don't believe the hype on the box -- you probably won't be disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great value", "unixReviewTime": 950918400, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2000"}
