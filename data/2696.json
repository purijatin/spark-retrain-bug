This made-in-China product proved to be very reliable.  It sounds great with games and CD audio.  It sounds A LOT better than those mini 2 speakers. For just $40, I don't see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers.  My only complain is the volume distortion.  If I push the volume higher than 5 using the build-in volume control, the speakers starts to have some background noise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great value but one flaw", "unixReviewTime": 984009600, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2001"}
