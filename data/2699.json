If you're shooting for looks, you won't get it.  These speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume control...makes for too many wires running  around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension  cords already.  As far as sound goes I thought they were far more than  serviceable.  If you really like to turn it up I would recommend something  a little more powerful, but if you have them in a smaller room and such  they'll do great.  Great price, nice sound, ugly packaging, but a definite  recommendation overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "No complaints", "unixReviewTime": 952905600, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2000"}
