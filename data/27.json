Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32\" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Mount", "unixReviewTime": 1331942400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2012"}
