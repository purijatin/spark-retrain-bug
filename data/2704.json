Otherwise it's about as good as a low quality surveillance cam. I don't know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around. For the price it's OK in good light forget it when the light begins to fade. The software is somewhat deficient too. when I tried to do a video capture it froze up.I would not recommend this to anyone", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Old product", "unixReviewTime": 1382140800, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2013"}
