You will be able to buy them from Auction sites (e.g., Ebay) or here at Amazon... but most likely, you will have to search endlessly for the Drivers of the item!  When you find the Drivers that you need to run this item... You will find an excellent, high quality webcam and worth the price!  I use webcams for a living (conference calls..etc...) and own top-of-the-line video conferencing cameras... and for the price of these cameras... they are worth it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "TOO bad 3COM Web Cams are a thing of the past....", "unixReviewTime": 1124755200, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2005"}
