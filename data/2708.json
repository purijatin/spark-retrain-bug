Excellent low light performance.  Detachable USB cable is easily replaced with a longer one.  Comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web.Cons:  Apparently 3com now owns the product, so expect no driver updates and no  useful customer support.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent camera, but expect no help from 3com", "unixReviewTime": 940118400, "reviewTime": "10 17, 1999"}
