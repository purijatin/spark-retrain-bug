The 3Com HomeConnect has remarkable low-light capability.  I use it as a &quot;weather cam.&quot;  It is pointed out the window of my office in Edinburgh, Indiana where it adapts well to everything from bright sunlight to ambient street lighting at night.  Unlike most Webcams, this one features a resolution as high as 640x480.  I also like the long, detachable USB cord.  Another plus is the easy setup  utility.  Basically, all you do is put the CD in the drive and it tells you  onscreen what to do next.  It's so simple!  Just don't plug the camera into  the USB port before the program instructs you to do so.  It's not the least  expensive camera on the market, but the extra price gets you a much better  camera than the average Webcam.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great pictures for a Webcam", "unixReviewTime": 945043200, "reviewTime": "12 13, 1999"}
