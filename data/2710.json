Do", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "Although it says that the camera is not Windows certified when it is being stalled, I have no problem whatsoever. I got the latest driver from vividcommunications.com.I have no idea why some people report low-light problem or color problems but this camera is the best that I've used in term of clarity and low-light capability.  I think once you figure out how to set this camera up, you'd enjoy this camera.With interchangable lenses, the camera can cover a wide range of angles.As for mounting, I went to Best Buy and got a pair of speaker wall mounts for about $$, which provides all the adjustment angles you'd need.  You only need one mount for each camera but have to buy them in pairs, as they are made for speakers.Good luck to those who are getting a webcam.  If you need more info on the mount, just contact me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I own three and run them on Win2K and XP", "unixReviewTime": 1062460800, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2003"}
