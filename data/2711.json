Installed on a Win2k Pro SP4.  No problem at all.COLOR: Terrible.  No matter how you set the controls, use auto or manual, or mess with the settings, the green/red/blue color rendition is always awful.  Color shades are all wrong - either too vivid, too washed out, too green, to intense, etc.FRAME RATE: Terrible.  There are 3 settings for picture quality vs frame rate.  On &quot;high&quot; quality, you get a nice smooth picture with so-so color, and a frame rate of 7 fps (I measured it).  On medium, the picture is very grainy, so you can turn down the sharpness, which helps &quot;somewhat&quot; - frame rate is now 15 fps.  On &quot;low&quot;, the picture is downright awful, with grain, and jagged lines, and the frame rate is still only about 19 fps.It cannot do 30 fps, nowhere near it, not at 160x120, 176x144, 320x240.  Forget it.CPU: Good.  Uses about the same as other good webcams I've tried --- about 20% of a PIII 900 MHz to capture 320x240 at 15 fps.LIGHT SENSITIVITY: Good.  The picture quality does not degrade, and the frame rate doesn't drop in low light, and the picture is plenty bright enough.  Unfortunately, the picture is NEVER good, and the frame rate is never good, so this is of little value.Go try a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 or an Intel CS430 and you'll see what a good web cam is capable of.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bad color, bad framerate, installs well", "unixReviewTime": 1063929600, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2003"}
