But I was hooked to this camera's response to low light and went ahead and bought it. I made  sure I stuck to the installation sequence (software tests first, installs  drivers and then you hook up the camera on reboot) and it worked!  Not only  that this is a twain compatible device and I got it to work smoothly with  Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and Premier 5.0. This deal is worth the risk. Picture  and video quality is really good and even better than the ones that come  out of the SGI video cameras (supposedly the graphics powerhorses).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great PC Camera - Works smoothly with Adobe 5.0 products", "unixReviewTime": 957484800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2000"}
