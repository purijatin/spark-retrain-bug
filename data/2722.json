Having just switched from III to V, the difference was dramatic.  I have spares of the  III type at my desk -- it's quicker to just grab that than pull the Palm's  one out, and I won't forget to put it back.I'm afraid of wearing down  my Palm's sensor surface, so am shopping for a &quot;softer&quot; stylus  for the V.  (The V's are a touch slimmer, so my spare stylii won't fit its  holder.)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "&quot;Hard&quot; tip -- Palm III stylus runs smoother", "unixReviewTime": 960163200, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2000"}
