It is neither. These styli do not fit the silo perfectly and the screws at the top and bottom are badly made, in contrast to the perfect screws and silo fitting of those that were provided with the product.- The price is excessive. Why should a simple piece of mass produced plastic cost over three U.S.$s, especially considering the mediocre quality of the product ?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works, but not as advertised.", "unixReviewTime": 1000252800, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2001"}
