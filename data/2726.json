Captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a P3-450 with 128megs ram.I then installed a USB cd writer. The  Dazzle device no longer works. I really don't care what installing the cd  writer did, I see this as a major flaw. My USB cd writer and USB zip drive  work perfectly. I'm now forced to use this device on another, much slower  computer. Nothing about this is mentioned on their site.This product is  VERY flakey. After making changes to video settings, you must exit the  program, unplug the device, plug it back in, and restart the capture  program. This seems to be Dazzle's solution for every problem I've  encountered with this piece of uhm.. plastic.It feels as if this product  was rushed out in a &quot;just make it work&quot; strategy. Dazzle  obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing  it.Stay away. Get a digital camcorder and DV card instead.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Works great, if you can get it to work at all.", "unixReviewTime": 962755200, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2000"}
