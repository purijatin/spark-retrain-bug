The device is exceptionally good for  making videos for use on the Web or as e-mail attachments. Thanks to its  use of USB its very simple to install and can be &quot;hot-swaped&quot;  with other USB device without rebooting your computer.I don't recommend  using the device if you plan on editing videos on your computer and want to  export it to video tape. If you will be using the device primarily for  making videos for web broadcasting there is an Internet version available  that is optimized for this task. The Internet version also includes a  RealVideo converter and encoder.The included software package is very  useful and stable. However, the included Ulead Video Studio and Ulead Photo  Express are not the most current version.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very useful for some tasks", "unixReviewTime": 958608000, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2000"}
