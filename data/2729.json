I've had the player for 6 years + and never had one issue with it. its the first and only stand alone dvd player i've had and works wonderfully. I also own 2 sony tvs, a sony reciever and vcr and satellite system and haven't once had an issue. I think that sony has continued their product quality no matter where they're built.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Flawless", "unixReviewTime": 1116720000, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2005"}
