Nolip-sync. The CD sounds even better than my other CD deck. What I like most is the headphone jack that allows me to listen to CD and watch DVD just with the DVD machine powered on, without disturbing others. Now the best part... that even Amazon staff does not know. This machine qualifies for 7 free DVDs and 33 free rental (10 from Netflix, 13 from Blockbuster via Sony coupon and 10 from Blockbuster 10/20 program). I waited until now to write this comment because I want to verify the above. I got all that.  What can I say: outstanding picture, gorgeous sound (I had a full 5 speakers sound system mated to a 5X100 Watts Dolby Digital, DTS receiver), and all the freebies listed above. You must be nut for buying any other DVD brand. After all, this is a Sony!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This gem is almost free!", "unixReviewTime": 948931200, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2000"}
