What puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the DVD menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit. It even has a Jog-shuttle dial on the unit for Still, Pause and Frame advance which is very smooth. This unit even has a built-in 5.1 Dolby Digital Decoder for 5.1 Upgradable Receivers. You get a choice of Composite, S or Component video outputs. The remote works on all SONY TVs. Very, very good for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Best DVD Players by SONY", "unixReviewTime": 981504000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2001"}
