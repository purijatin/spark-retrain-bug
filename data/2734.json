The only problem I have noticed is that a disc is supposed to resume from the point you stopped when you push &quot;stop&quot; and the display says  &quot;resume.&quot;  Mine does not do this consistently, and never seems to  do it with CD, but perhaps this feature does not work with CD.  Aside from  that one baffling inconsistency, I love my 530.  I have it hooked into a  Yamaha Dolby Digital &quot;ready&quot; receiver, and find that the bass  management controls in the Sony 530 are excellent for setting up my system.  I have a full surround system using all Paradigm Monitor series speakers,  and the sound from the 530 when used as a CD player is so clear that you  can hear individual string plucks on guitar, and other details you don't  often hear.  The picture quality is so superior to VHS, that I can scarcely  stand to watch VHS anymore.  When it comes to video products, and  particularly digital video, you can't beat Sony.  Don't waste your money  trying any other brands.  You'll just wish you had bought Sony to begin  with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No problems.
