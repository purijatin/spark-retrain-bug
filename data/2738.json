The video quality is simply astonishing - I won my wife over by doing a direct comparison with the laserdisc and DVD versions of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; - she is 100% sold now! There's enough flexibility that you can upgrade to a component-video-capable TV if you don't have one now; I'm using the S-video output and THAT blows me away.  The remote has EXCELLENT human factors engineering - I have no trouble using it in a dimly-lit room for the usual functions (pause, slow forward/backwards, fast, etc.) plus some HANDY features like &quot;How much time is left on the movie?&quot; Menu access is simple and intuitive, too - no teeny-tiny pixie-sized buttons to feel around for. Full 5.1 outputs and DTS/Dolby Digital if you can use them and a host of options for the two-three speaker folks. Really, this has everything you could ask for in a player in this price range - I don't know who selected the Toshiba as Amazon's pick, but THIS is REALLY the one you want!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No problems with synch - a GREAT product!", "unixReviewTime": 948153600, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2000"}
