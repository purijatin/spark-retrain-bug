We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian &quot;ger&quot; (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A definite winner- Buy this camera!", "unixReviewTime": 943315200, "reviewTime": "11 23, 1999"}
