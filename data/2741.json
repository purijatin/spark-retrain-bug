Petit", "helpful": [23, 23], "reviewtext": "The Olympus D-340R is, in my opinion, the best value digital camera available right now.The picture quality is impressive---I usually can't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a $340 SLR that I have scanned in.Also, the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use, like a good point and shoot camera  should be.Since I bought my Olympus, I have not taken 1 non-digital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs (some $10/roll).Overall, the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top Notch Digital Photography for a Bargain Price", "unixReviewTime": 943574400, "reviewTime": "11 26, 1999"}
