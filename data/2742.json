Frame a photo from the 340 and you can tell it is a digital photo.  Frame a photo from the 3040 and you would never know it was digital!  So, I love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if I liked a digital camera more than my old 35mm.  But, two years later, I've found the need to upgrade.  However, due to the significant price jump, the comparisons to the 3040 are not totally fair!  So I still give the 340 a rating of 5 stars because for the price I think it is a great option!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent camera, but the quality of the photo is lacking...", "unixReviewTime": 1006732800, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2001"}
