I gave it 4 stars, mainly because the manual wasn't well written.  However, that still being the case, I must say that this camera deserves 5 stars!  It takes amazingly clear, bright pictures.  The video display LCD  is bright.  And it seemed to take forever for the rechargable batteries to  run down! I highly recommend this camera!  If it had an optical zoom, it  would be perfect.  However, with this camera, you get more than you pay for!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm upgrading my rating", "unixReviewTime": 945043200, "reviewTime": "12 13, 1999"}
