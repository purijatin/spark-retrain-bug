Madrid Molina", "helpful": [18, 18], "reviewtext": "I've owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far. I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language, not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod, you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although it's not  documented in the manual, the camera comes with a TWAIN driver, so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product, good value", "unixReviewTime": 941673600, "reviewTime": "11 4, 1999"}
