Really. (as evidenced by the unusually hi cost in the used camera market for these 1.2-1.3mp cameras) I own 4 of them and use them for my business.  People are always commenting on what great quality photos I produce.  The adjustment allows you to take photos in low  pixels so the saved photos won't eat up all the space on your computer or camera card.**A note of caution, the smart cards with 4-8 mpixels that fit this camera are very difficult to find now days and expensive to boot.I think it won't take over a 16mp card.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best camera made!", "unixReviewTime": 1169337600, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2007"}
