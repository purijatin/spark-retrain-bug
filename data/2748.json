Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that won't crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilm-Combo Reader. About $79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Great", "unixReviewTime": 947462400, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2000"}
