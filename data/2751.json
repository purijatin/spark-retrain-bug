I travel frequently and the L50 keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the Airplane. The folks that make the PowerXtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for  the L50 so you won't need to take extra batteries on those long flights.  The screen is very nice looking, and the 16x9 format lets you view  anamorphic format DVDs in their best possible resolution. Of course, the  wide screen also causes you to curse the DVDs that AREN't anamorphic (e.g.,  Titanic). The sound from the built-in speakers is ok, but sounds very good  from a pair of headphones. For travelers I recommend a pair of the Sony  Noise Cancelling Ear Buds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible screen!", "unixReviewTime": 931392000, "reviewTime": "07 8, 1999"}
