The only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life!  This was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than 2  hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours.  This was  pretty good however, and the battery life doesn't hurt the rating for me  since I got the power adapter!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So Long Hand Held TV!", "unixReviewTime": 946080000, "reviewTime": "12 25, 1999"}
