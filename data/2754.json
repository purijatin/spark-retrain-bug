But to make it work the very best, you need a couple of additional items.  1.  You need GOOD noise cancelling ear phones to get rid of the background noise on airplanes,  trains, buses, cars, etc.  Panasonic Model RP-HC100 or similar.  2.  You  need a 'splitter' so that two of you (if you have a significant other) can  watch the movie together.  (Radio Shack) Then all you need to bring is  popcorn.  3.  For those long flights, you'll need one or two extra  batteries.  The battery that comes with it will play for about three  hours.  It takes a LONG time to charge these batteries (about four hours)  so be prepared.  ENJOY!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a VERY cool toy.", "unixReviewTime": 949708800, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2000"}
