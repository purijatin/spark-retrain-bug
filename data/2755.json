The picture and sound are both great.  The unit comes with enough cables to get you hooked into a TV.  It even has on optical out, so you HI-FI buffs will enjoy pure digital...I travel  quite a bit and this thing has been great for occupying my time...As far  as not using it on an airplane- I disagree.  I beleive the line goes-  &quot;Portable electronic devices may now be used with the expection of  cellular phones and pagers...&quot;  Most all laptops have cd-roms and they  have not been the cause of any plane crashes to date.In summary- if you  travel a lot get it, but shop around for the best deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect...", "unixReviewTime": 943315200, "reviewTime": "11 23, 1999"}
