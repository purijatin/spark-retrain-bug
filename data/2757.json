NiMH batteries or NiCd batteries do not hold charge like an alkaline battery so if you have charged an NiMH battery and put it in say an alarm clock, the batteries will lose charge in less than a month. they are for immediate usages like digital cameras where you need high mAh batteries and that digital cameras drain batteries. its more like \"spend it immediately\" battery unlike the disposable batteries that discharge in a circuit but drain very slowly when not in a circuit. I use Energizer AA batteries for my digicam and they recharge the flash much faster than even the best disposable batteries. A best guide is to look whether the appliance for which you are buying this battery is listed on the package or is identical to those on the package. this 9V would be a great thing for a toy where the battery drains out fast and you cannot afford disposable ones everyday.Just a note: If the device is a direct draining one like a motor and not in a solid-state circuit, do not use a rechargeable battery since if they are completely drained, they cannot be recharged.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Know what you want first", "unixReviewTime": 1051056000, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2003"}
