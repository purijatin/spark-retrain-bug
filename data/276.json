The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic product", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2012"}
