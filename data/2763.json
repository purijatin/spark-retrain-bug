Barnard", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewtext": "This battery, like other rechargable batteries I own, is rated for 8.4 volts and I'm told is likely even less.  Why not go with Maha?  It's rated at over 9 volts, which for my applications (powering a headroom micro dac) makes all the difference.  I can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices' designated power requirements, is better across the board.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Get a real 9 volt battery", "unixReviewTime": 1173398400, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2007"}
