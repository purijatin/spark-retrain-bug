Great product!So now I have used this product for 5 months on a Microphone to line amplifyer and they last about 2 days on average.  The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous! luckly I only use one at a time so I have time to charge the other one.I would still say Great Product!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Battery", "unixReviewTime": 1210204800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2008"}
