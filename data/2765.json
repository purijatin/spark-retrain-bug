We were going through about 4 9V batteries every week, but with this it holds enough charge for the wireless system for 2 1 hour services each battery! It has taken the cost of batteries from $15 a week to nothing and it can be charged overnight! No Problems at al with them, in fact we ordered 2 of them for backups along with 4 AA rechargables that we use for our CD players and Recordering devices and they al work wonders!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No Problems!", "unixReviewTime": 1243036800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2009"}
