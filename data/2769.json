Infantino, MD \"drgonzo3003\"", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewtext": "The Energizer Battery charger seems to be a great buy for the money. I have been using it for many years without any problems. The NimH Batteries seem to last long and a good charger does help.  I bought 2 extra chargers so I could charge 12 at one time.  Another great feature is that this battery charger could charge all types of batteries. You don't need different chargers for different batteries. I have shopped around ther internet and when Amazon has it in stock in their store, Buy It! They have the best price!I would buy 2 and get the free super saving shipping at the same time. Happy Charging! Peace, Anthony", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great NiMh Battery Charger", "unixReviewTime": 1132444800, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2005"}
