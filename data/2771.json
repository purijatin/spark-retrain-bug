It charges both NiMH and NiCd batteries in all sizes AA,AAA,C,D& 9 volt.  A full charge takes about six hours.  You can charge different sizes at the same time.  I consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SIMPLE & WORKS WELL", "unixReviewTime": 1227830400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2008"}
