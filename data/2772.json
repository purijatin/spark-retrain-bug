Unfortunately the Maha MH-C801D needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge, so that is why I sometimes need to use this Energizer CHM4FC for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the Maha MH-C801D to initiate a charge.  The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.  The Maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries.  At least the Energizer CHM4FC does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening 15 minute chargers however.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a smart charger but it has its uses and it is cheap.", "unixReviewTime": 1165536000, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2006"}
