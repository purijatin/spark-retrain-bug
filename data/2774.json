It seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time (both NiMH and NiCad).  So if your battery is only slightly discharged it'll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead.  It also can't charge batteries individually which my Rayovac charger can.  The only downfall of my Rayovac is that it can only charge AA and AAA which is all I need.  I paid 25 dollars for the Energizer and the Rayovac was only 10 dollars...  BIG difference.  If you can find a Rayovac recharger at your local store get it!  I even got 16 NiMH batteries for 25 dollars - PLUS they're ALL 1600mah (higher the rating the more power).  Just thought I'd let everyone know.  Alohaz", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not as &quot;smart&quot; as other rechargers", "unixReviewTime": 987120000, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2001"}
