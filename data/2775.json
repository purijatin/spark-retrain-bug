Allen Greenbaum", "helpful": [10, 14], "reviewtext": "It appears that there are several battery rechargers available that may be better for specific needs. For example, one may want a faster recharger for use with a camera, or one that does AA batteries only, or one that work with nickel-metal batteries only.  For more specialized uses, there are instruments that are both higher and lower in price.That said, I agree that this is a versatile, reasonably priced recharger.  As you can see above, it works on size AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V batteries. I've used the recharger safely now for over a year (Please read all safety instructions), usually by plugging it in at night.  As noted elsewhere, you need to charge one or two pairs of batteries at a time (with the exception of 9v batteries). Here are a few specs for people with some electrical knowledge (unlike myself; I just read these off the back):Input:  AC120V, 60Hz, 15WOutput: 2x (2.8v...500mA)2x (9.8v...13mA)NOTE:  As stated clearly on front and back, use ONLY for rechargeable nickel-metal hydride or nickel-cadmium batteries (not both at the same time, however). Also, these batteries are generally more expensive than non-rechargeable alkaline batteries, but for people who have a lot of toys and tools with different battery needs, this may be the one to get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good All Around Product for the Money", "unixReviewTime": 1069286400, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2003"}
