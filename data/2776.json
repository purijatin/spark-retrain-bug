This recharger is inexpensive and dependable.  Given that there are four battery docks, you'll never run out of charged batters.  This recharger quickly charges nickel metal hydrido (NiMH), nickel-cadmium (NiCD), AAA, AA or 9V rechargeable batteries.  The price is fantastic and what it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in power and speed.  When the batteries are charged, the light displays green and be warned that it is normal for the batteries to be warm.  Unfortunately there is no real carrying case for travel.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What Do You Expect For The Money?", "unixReviewTime": 1119484800, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2005"}
