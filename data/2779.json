Use it to sync your laptop or connect to any  other serial device.I bought it to use as a second hot sync cable to  help keep by home computer and work computer synced.  The full sized cradle  is more expensive and less versatile.You can use it to turn your Palm  into a terminal, via a modem or direct connection.  Note: you may need a  null modem adapter for some devices.For programmers, I think this cable  is fabulous. It makes the Palm useful as a programming interface for any  serial device.The low cost of a Palm and cable means any small serial  interface device, like a voicemail system, can have a permanent or  temporary display hooked up without adding a lot of expensive hardware, or  hauling around a heavy laptop.I think this concept will increase the  need for Palm programmers and generate a new breed of Palm based  application interfaces with associated software.Buy it if you need a  method to sync to a laptop when travelling, or for an interface for a  serial device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Travel accessory for you Palm", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
