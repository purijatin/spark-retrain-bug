Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case.  This is especially useful for Palm VIIs, which can't use the  version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable  does not have a synchronize button. In order to use it, connect the cable,  turn on your Palm, press the HotSynch icon, and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable  connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on  your batteries, so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish  synching.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Every Palm VII owner with a laptop needs one of these", "unixReviewTime": 954892800, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2000"}
