This cable is the ideal solution if you travel or if you need to sync with more than one PC. The generous 3' cable length is perfect - better a long cable than one that's too short.Keep in mind that this is NOT a USB sync cable, it's a practical serial device for the Palm III &amp; VII, along with some of the older models.Read the other reviews here and you'll find other creative uses for this cable, so I won't repeat them here. You'll also see that most of the owners who needed a serial sync cable agree - get this and you won't be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Palm IIIxe?
