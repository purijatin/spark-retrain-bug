These words describe both the HotSync cradle that came with my Palm IIIx and this cable which I just purchased.  However, if you travel a lot, and sync to a laptop or second computer, this  cable is the way to go.I takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag, and  can fit in virtually any luggage pocket (and also a suit pocket).There  is no other software to install.  Just pull the cable out of the bag,  attach to your PC and Palm and sync using the HotSync icon on the Palm  itself.One way that it could be improved would be with a button on the  cable end itself which would trigger the HotSync.  This would most likely  make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long  term, however.  All in all, a well-designed and utterly useful product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My Palm kit is now complete", "unixReviewTime": 956793600, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2000"}
