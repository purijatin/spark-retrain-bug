He is not a genius at electronics. We called the Toshiba service 1-800 support line and were patiently assisted with the installation. This was  extremely helpful to us. This is easy to install but if you aren't an  electronic wiz, this is a very good asset. The DVD player itself seems  flawless to us at this point. I would recommend it highly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great service from Toshiba", "unixReviewTime": 944006400, "reviewTime": "12 1, 1999"}
