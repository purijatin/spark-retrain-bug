Sound and picture as rich as can be. It is worth hooking up to a stereo system if you have one near your television.Remote features are  excellent, allowing for more tricks than you'll use. Chose this after too  many negative reviews of low price Sony models (I'm sure everything is  fixed, but I wasn't going to take a chance over the holidays). Wasn't a  Toshiba fan before this purchase (simple Sony prejudice) but now I'm  willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large TV's. You'll enjoy  this player and its price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "HIGHEST value-to-price ratio. Not a flaw.", "unixReviewTime": 957312000, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2000"}
