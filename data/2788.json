It is the first DVD player I've ever owned.  The sound and picture are great with my dad's home theater.  I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom.  I just bought a 32-inch Toshiba tv for my bedroom.For those of you who have problems getting rid of the ZOOM in the lower right hand corner, hit the setup button TWICE, that should get rid of the ZOOM.Enjoy!Update 10/9/07I still have this DVD player and it works great!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Toshiba DVD Owner", "unixReviewTime": 956534400, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2000"}
