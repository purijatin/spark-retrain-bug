I bought it after doing a lot of research online and truly understanding how the machine works. It came down to this one.Why?Zoom function: You can actually zoom in and look at minute detail on the movie and pan left and right on it. It also allows for \"outside\" angles -- meaning you can pan left or right while a movie is playing to see outside details from the center screen, if the director/dvd makers allow it (which I'm sure will be the next push in the technology). Speeds: The selection of scan through speeds is amazing -- all with startling clarity. Resolution: I scoffed that a DVD could produce THAT much better resolution and clarity of sound, but whoa man! This is amazing -- I truly am blown away with what kind of quality you get off this DVD player. Compatibility/ease of function: This DVD player is so incredibly easy to use, you basically just plug it in and play a movie.Finally: The dual tray for DVD play. This player comes with two trays to put in two movies -- which you'll find with longer epics out there. It's simple to switch between on disc to the other, and it makes it awfully convenient for viewing pleasure.They should really bring this product back. It's the best out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's too bad they stopped making this", "unixReviewTime": 975542400, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2000"}
