Now that they released a 8gb nook for $199.00 its price point is on par with the fire, and has the option of expansion, and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher, and i can easily install the amazon app store(and kindle app), android market place, and have a very decent wifi tablet, tbh i wasn't much of a analog book reader, but with this little nook tablet i've been averaging a book a week, along with .99-1.99 monthly magazine subscriptions.when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later, it was less then what i expected, but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive.battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "amazing device vs kindle fire and better pricepoint then iPad", "unixReviewTime": 1329955200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012"}
