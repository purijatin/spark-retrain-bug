I like the dual disc operation of this player.  You can put two disc in the player and just sit back and enjoy.  It has every possible connection that you need.  The sound is great, the  picture is great.  I do wish that there was more controls on the front of  the player, like a menu button you must use the remote for all of the  players functions other than play, stop, pause and forward and reverse.  This play also reads HDCD's, but not CDR's which are rewriteable disc.  You  can switch between the two disc and the player continues to play non stop.  I like the feature of changing the black level of the picture which makes  the colors just pop.  This a great machine and a must have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Machine", "unixReviewTime": 958348800, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2000"}
