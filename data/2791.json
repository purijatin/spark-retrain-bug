Your Palm already came with one cradle, but you really need an extra to ensure all your PC's are in sync.What more can be said...it's the same high quality and easy to use charging cradle that came with your Palm.  Mostly a convenience thing for casual users, but for those who use their Palms alot, you need an extra.  Pick one up now while they're still available.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must if you use your Palm at home and the office.", "unixReviewTime": 1020384000, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2002"}
