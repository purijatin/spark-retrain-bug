Palm products have always been of the best quality, and the Palm V Hotsync Cradle is no exception. I purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop, so I can sync with several computers. The cradle bottom is metal, and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it. A must buy for palm V(x) users that need to sync with another computer, or need one at the office and at home. Whatever the case maybe, its very handy to have an extra cradle around.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Accessory", "unixReviewTime": 990576000, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2001"}
