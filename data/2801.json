I took my Palm Vx to Italy and had no trouble keeping it charged thanks to the adapters.  I felt safe doing it with the converter too.  I know people who have damaged computer equipment by trying to make do with cheap adapters.The sync cord is great.  I use it at work instead of buying another cradle.  It would be nice if they sold this separately.In the end, my only problem with this kit is the price.  It's a bit much for what you get.  I suppose if you travel overseas a lot it'll pay for itself eventually.  Occaisional travellers will just have to swallow the cost.Do I hear any third party vendors out there???PS: This would get 4 stars if it were cheaper and 5 stars if you could use the adapter plugs with other things (they're made to be used only with this converter).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works Well...but at a price!", "unixReviewTime": 973641600, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2000"}
