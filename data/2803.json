Schwartz", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewtext": "I travel quite often, and lugging around the weighty Hot Sync/Charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase. With the travel kit, the charger and Hot Sync cable are seperate, and much lighter, without the stand like the cradle. Works just as good as the cradle too. I like the fact that the charger comes with 3 extra plugs, which can be used for different countries! Great travel kit at a reasonable price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for any Traveler!", "unixReviewTime": 989193600, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2001"}
