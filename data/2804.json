Too bad Nikon doesn't include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras.  My wish list:  an automotible cigarette-lighter adapter  so I can recharge batteries &quot;on the fly&quot;.  Overall, a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Should be standard equipment with Nikon Coolipx 950", "unixReviewTime": 935280000, "reviewTime": "08 22, 1999"}
