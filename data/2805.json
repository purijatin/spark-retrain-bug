I bought these, and mine came with 1450 batteries. ...Another  note: It doesn't have an electric cord, just two plug-prongs that flip out  and go into a socket.  Makes it very compact, somewhat elegant.  BUT: its  design is such that (1) it doesn't work well in a horizontal outlet, only  in a vertical outlet, i.e. where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle.  In a horizontal outlet, the box ends up hanging precariously on its side,  prone to falling out of the wall.  (2) if you happen not to have the lower  outlet open, it doesn't sit readily in the upper outlet because it's upside  down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall.  So far it hasn't fallen out in this position, but it's probably gonna some  day.  Personally, I think a regular electric cord and plug would have been  better -- I suspect Kodak just wanted to save a few bucks, and calls it a  &quot;feature&quot;.  Other than that it's okay, but why did I really spend  this much money?  As long as it's UL listed, buy yourself a cheaper  recharger from a major brand name, and make sure it's intended for nimh  batteries if that's what you want.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Comes with 1450 mah batteries", "unixReviewTime": 964742400, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2000"}
