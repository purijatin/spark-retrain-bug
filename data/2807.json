I use it for my Nikon Coolpix and have noticed that one full charge of the 1450 mA batteries lasts 5-6 times as long as  the disposable alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  Full  recharging takes about 3 hours.  The plug on the back of the charger folds  up into the unit so you can slip it into your pocket or bag with no problem  and be rechargable anywhere!Overall, slightly more expensive than other  units out there, but worth it.  Be sure to get 1450 mA NiMH (nickel metal  hydride) batteries if you're going to buy extra batteries with it; you'll  find all kinds of uses for them (pager, penlight, handheld games, etc.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth the extra price", "unixReviewTime": 960595200, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2000"}
