I didn't expect Manfrotto carbon-fiber quality, but the head is a bit disappointing.  The quick-release plate is somewhat fussy to get onto a camera and into the head.If you're going to mount a still camera and leave it stationary indoors, this unit should work passably, but beware if you're going to use it with a video camera:  mine doesn't pan smoothly and wobbles quite a bit when using any controls on my Canon HG21 or the Rode SVM mounted on top, or when people walk around nearby.  This leads to shaky video, even with in-camera IS, which in turn works against the compressibility of the resultant files.  The tilt hinge is something of a disappointment, as with a still camera in landscape orientation, when fully closed the camera is slightly tilted.If one's needs are very occasional and don't require panning or much adjustment, this could be a reasonable buy.  It's probably also fine for holding reflectors, mic booms, or lights.  I think, though for video use I'm going to invest in a Slik or other unit around the $90-150 range.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Okay for what it is -- but be sure to not underestimate your needs", "unixReviewTime": 1242000000, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2009"}
