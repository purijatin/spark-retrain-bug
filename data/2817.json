Great for taking pictures of low light settings, night shots, etc. since the tripod will keep the camera still and won;t blur the shot. The only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself! Still worth it for about $20.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "must have", "unixReviewTime": 1165622400, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2006"}
