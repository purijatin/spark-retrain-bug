I tried to use it several times -  does it's job only if the camera is positioned right on top (90 degrees). If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight. I was using canon powershot S3 IS, which is really light. I can't imagine if you use it with a dslr camera. My final conclusion - It is good if you don't need to change the vertical position of the camera.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Light yes, but can't hold camera", "unixReviewTime": 1244937600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2009"}
