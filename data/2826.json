I wanted something inexpensive but which would work to help me recover the old docs, and this filled the bill.I plugged the disk drive into the usb port of my Asus laptop running Windows 7, and the computer immediately recognized it. I held my breath and put in the first floppy. I opened the floppy from &#34;My Computer,&#34; and there were all of my old documents -- which I was actually able to open and convert to a modern format.I only needed to use this drive once, so I didn't want to spend much money, but on the other hand, I needed something that would work, and preferably without having to deal with installing new drivers for it. This was perfect for my needs. I'd actually used some Sabrent products before, so I hoped it would turn out to be a reliable drive, and it did.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for recovering data on old floppies", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}
