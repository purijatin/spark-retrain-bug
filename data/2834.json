I have windows 7, and was concerned about it working properly. BUT, no problem, it comes with a disc, but of course, you don't need it for windows 7, just plug it in and windows 7 finds and install the driver automatically and I was up and running in under a minute.  This was certainly worth the price.  I had so many 3.5 left over from the 90s.  I had no idea any more what exactly was on them, so I just could never trash them.  And, I am glad I didn't trash them.  There was some great stuff on those things.  Laughs and memories.  It's amazing how things have changed of the past 20 years.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.  And an extra note, it doesn't pull up stuff automatically.  You have to go thru your exporer and find the drive and open it, but if you have 3.5s you probably can handle that.  Cheers, great product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow, I love it.  Nice, very nice. Great price too.", "unixReviewTime": 1341100800, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2012"}
