This piece of equipment will only accept 720K DD disks for the project info.  Unfortunately this drive will NOT recognize 720K disks that already have info on them, it will not format them (even through a command line with unconditional override applied).  I tested it with some HD disks as well just to make sure it was a hardware limitation and not a defect.  The drive reads, writes, and formats HD disks (although it is slow and noisy and seems to have some marginal head sensitivity)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Will NOT read 720K DD disks.
