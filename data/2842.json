After unboxing I was able to attach it to my Windows XP box and it picked it right up without any driver installation or administrative rights required.Using WinImage I was able to image aging floppies with &#34;bad spots&#34; (and ignore them even if I couldn't find a way to do so automatically) in order to retrieve data I wanted.I've only just started using it so I can't speak to its long term reliability, but if this drive dies before I finish processing the remaining 100+ floppies I'll  modify my review accordingly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Plug & play, 100+ floppies later still going strong", "unixReviewTime": 1376092800, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2013"}
