The drive installed completely plug and play and operated without any further actions to install it. The operation is a bit querky on some disks, all of which must be High Density (HD) 1.44mb disks. I had one problem and discovered the write protection slide tab was open. Sabrent's latest manual SFT-USDB_NewManual.pdf, from their website, explains that the write protection tab must not be open (so you can see through it -- for those of you that have not been through the glorious 3.5 floppy era) for the drive to function correctly. Also, I tried several techniques to get some floppies to work correctly -- right clicked on folder and selected Open, ejected and replugged the drive without the floppy in it, and several verbal invectives. Most of my photos, program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily, albeit slowly, onto the hard drives. Overall, a good bargain compared to the hassle of trying to install a 3.5 floppy into the computer that wasn't designed to accept such an installation. Also, the floppy is an acceptable media for transferring smaller files from computer to computer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "program data files and old program installation files seemed to copy easily, albeit slowly", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}
