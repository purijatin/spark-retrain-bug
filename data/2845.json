I have used it in both Windows 8 and Linux without issue. It presents a USB Mass Storage device so it doesn't need a special driver.The floppy drives of old were heavy, high quality, and made of metal. They were also very expensive. This floppy drive is lightweight and made primarily of plastic. It is made as well as it needs to be --- especially considering the very low price.Personally, I wouldn't mind paying more for more heavy-duty floppy drive, but the reality is, there is no point. Floppy drives aren't needed very often these days and there's no point in paying extra for a device that will get occasional use at most.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great value", "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2013"}
