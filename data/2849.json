This served a purpose but in the end run is just a desperate attempt to read all old floppies and move their info off to CD-Rs for more permanent storage (until the begin to disappear as well)Using this with OS X is a real pain, using it with Parallels 9 on OS X to recover or produce temporary FDDs for Win or MS-DOS apps is useless.
