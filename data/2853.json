I see from the reviews that this happens fairly frequently. Buying one of these appears to be a roll of the dice.UPDATE:  After returning this item and buying a USB floppy drive from a different manufacturer, I learned that on my OS (Windows 7) that the drive will probably not automatically appear. You have to open the Start menu and choose Computer, and then click the icon for the A drive, to \"activate\" the USB floppy drive. If you then double-click the A icon, you can see the files on any floppy that's inserted into the drive.The Sabrent drive may well have been a fully functioning drive; I just didn't know about this little workaround at the time.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Dead on arrival - or is it?", "unixReviewTime": 1398470400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2014"}
