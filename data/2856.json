Poulin", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "After purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didn't work on Windows 7, I got a refund and purchased this instead.  It was twenty dollars with free shipping.  As soon as I plugged it in it worked.  I read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files I needed to my hard drive.  I do recommend this however if you are using windows 7 I'll give you a few pointers.  First off there is no install disc, simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device.  It will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the USB floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive A.  You will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in.  It may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy it's not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means...however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you.Bottom line, this works great you just need a little patience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This one works", "unixReviewTime": 1398643200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2014"}
