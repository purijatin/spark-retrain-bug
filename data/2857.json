In modern times, a floppy drive is nearly a dinosaur, and the majority of new computers don't &#34;waste&#34; space on them.  That's sensible, as they're seldom needed.  However, there remain those old &#34;sacred&#34; files long ago squirreled away on floppies, and their loss can upon occasion be a catastrophe of sorts.  These little drives are totally up to date with USB connectibility, and cost next to nothing.  I've been grateful to have carried one (a Sony) in my briefcase for many years.  This one was purchased for an associate who needed to transfer files from an older commercial graphics machine to alternate locations.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A necessity nicely wrought and priced right.", "unixReviewTime": 1386633600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2013"}
