I like the Nook simple Touch, Nook Tablet because I primarily use it to read books, watch an occasional video (YouTube), listen to music on Pandora, and work a cross-word puzzle or play a game. Because I enjoyed my Nook so much, I decided to purchase the Nook HD because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size. Now that I have purchased the Nook HD I have some pros and cons about the product. Nothing serious, I will give myself a little more time to get used to it. But I am concerned about the short battery life.Pros: Light weight and smaller than the previous tablet; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds.Cons: I have to get used to the new interface, the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate; when playing games and connecting to the web using wi-fi, I have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&#8212;I may have to carry my charger with me; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet.Overall, I am pleased with my Nook HD Tablet. Once I have resolved some of the cons with this product, I will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basis.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect size and Lightweight Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1392422400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2014"}
