Now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive, I thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them.  I have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them, until I got this drive.  I like it so well that I will probably order another one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Floppy Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1392854400, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2014"}
