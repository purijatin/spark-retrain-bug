Ito", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Cleaning out my office after an almost 3 decade career I ran across dozens of old 1.44mb floppies.  Recalling that I had used several for photos in one of the original Panasonic digital cameras I decided I had better take a look before I tossed them in the recycle bin.  Unfortunately my current computers both at work and at home no longer have floppy disk readers, so the Sabrent External USB reader was an easy solution.  GLAD I did because I found several photos I had forgotten I had.  I have other Sabrent products:  USB3 SD and Micro SD card reader and a USB2 external sound card.  All three work as intended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must have item", "unixReviewTime": 1392076800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2014"}
