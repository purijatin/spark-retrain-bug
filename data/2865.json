I simply plugged into my computer using the Windows 7 program and the drive self loaded the software which took approximately 1 minute.  It was ready to use.  I was able to transfer my pictures from the floppy disks to CD's enabling me to view my old pictures which I hadn't seen for a long while.  I would, at this point, recommend the Sabrent external floppy disk drive as I am very satisfied with the product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple-just plug & play", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2014"}
