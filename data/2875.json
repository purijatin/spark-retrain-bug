If you know the disk might have useful data on it, cancel the prompt and open up the Windows Explorer (Windows Key+E) to let Windows reread the disk contents, and voil&agrave;, the disk contents will be presented promptly in the Explorer window.  I am pretty sure this behavior is due to Windows 7, not the drive, since using it under XP didn't exhibit the symptom and, certainly, booting the PC from the same diskettes (which I've already done) wouldn't be possible if the drive couldn't read the disk.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent 3.5\" HD floppy disk drive", "unixReviewTime": 1383696000, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2013"}
