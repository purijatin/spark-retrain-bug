I plugged the USB drive into a Windows 7 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized.  This was a one-off transfer, it worked and I won't use it again. Dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage. God love anyone still using floppies...they have the patience of a saint. File transfers are slow because of the old technology, not the drive. The 4th star was for the easy plug and play, otherwise my rating is a neutral 3.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I used it once and it worked", "unixReviewTime": 1399507200, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2014"}
