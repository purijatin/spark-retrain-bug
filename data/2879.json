So we contacted the company through amazon and they sent us another one free of charge.  The second one works just fine and have not had any problems with it.  It is nice being able to save all my old files on a computer and not having to lose them.  It also works great for if you want to install an old operating system on another computer that doesn't accept floppy disk.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty Good USB Floppy Disk Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1399420800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2014"}
