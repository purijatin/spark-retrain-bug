It had repeatedly failed to read ANY floppy. The only other problem I've encountered (in only 1 hour of testing) is that the device driver (written by Microsoft) hung on one occasion, requiring a reboot to resolve.I would also note that the User Manual available online is for a Teac drive while the drive they sent me is a Mitsumi drive. That said, the Teac User Manual seems entirely applicable to the Mitsumi drive. But, if you search the Sabrent web site for the model number of the Mitsumi drive (FL-UDRV), you will find (at this time) no information on that model number at all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It Works IF You Wait 1 Minute After Plugging it in", "unixReviewTime": 1391212800, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2014"}
