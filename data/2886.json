However, and old timer like me has many files still on floppy discs, both 3.5 inch and a few 5 1/4 inch. That got me to thinking about what I could do about them. I have an OLD FDD/multi-card reader that the card reader works with Windows 7 64-bit but the FDD won't. So I searched Amazon and came across the Sabrent. I read the customer ratings,as I always do, and saw that many people said it worked with their Windows 7 and even Windows 8. So I ordered it, received it, plugged it in and within a few seconds Windows 7 64-bit said it was ready for use. I popped in a FD and heard the old familiar whirring noise. I double-clicked on Computer and there it was! I double-clicked on it and heard the drive reading the disk and saw my files display.How weird the young ones would have probably thought if they'd seen my face when it worked.Now I don't have to worry about the hundreds of floppy discs that I have not been able to read for the last few years.I haven't tried it with the low-density discs as I don't think I have any. I learned long ago to just buy the 1.44 MB discs as they were more cost-effective.Now to copy the discs to my computer and then back them up to CD/DVD/External HDD.NOTE: Nothing on the package mine came in says it's compatible with any particular version of Windows. It only shows &#34;Windows PC Compatible&#34;, &#34;Mac OS X Compatible&#34;, USB 1.1/2.0/3.0 compatible and hot swappable.Now, about the 5.25 inch discs....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you have old 3.5 inch floppy discs you NEED this drive!", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"}
