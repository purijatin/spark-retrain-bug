Just plug it into any USB slot and Windows Explorer will see the drive without any drivers, and it even works from the from the front USB slots.  I've tried it on a WinXP system and on a Windows 7 64-bit system, and it works perfectly on both to read and write to the floppies.The price is great as well.  I have some old internal floppy drives still, but motherboards no longer come with the connection for them, unless you want to install a 3rd party card to connect it, all of which would be much pricier than the cost of this drive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great drive if you need to access old floppies", "unixReviewTime": 1399334400, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2014"}
