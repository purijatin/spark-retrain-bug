The product itself works and yes it works with the Operating Systems but it didn't work for my needs. I had old floppies from and XP machine and wanted to get data back. With this I kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which I knew not to be the case (yes, I'm aware of degradation of floppy drives over time). I did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesn't recognize some of the older floppy disks.I managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks. All but 2 of the disks resulted in data retrieval. So while this actually works (drivers install, shows up as a valid drive, etc.) it really doesn't. Most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didn't do for me.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sorta works", "unixReviewTime": 1388102400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013"}
