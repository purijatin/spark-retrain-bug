It's just a bare drive, no cable, no driver, manual - nothing. If you know what you're doing or are replacing an old floppy it'll do, but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere. They should put that it's OEM in the description.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It's OEM!", "unixReviewTime": 1014854400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2002"}
