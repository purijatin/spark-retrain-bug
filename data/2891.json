Discs would not read at all in any of the 5 XP computers at work that still had floppy drives....errors and &#34;format disc?&#34; options....but no reading what so ever.Bought this and plugged it up to my Win 8 machine....and first disc read like a charm.  Other discs popped errors, but after reinserting/opening 2-3 times, all would eventually read, and I was able to retrieve 190 of a total 215 pictures from the stacks of discs.Can't say I will ever use it again, and it DID take a little wrangling and a lot of time...BUT $14 isn't much to spend to retrieve priceless memories from 15 yr old floppies no other drive would read.  Money well spent.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does the job (somewhat)", "unixReviewTime": 1402531200, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2014"}
