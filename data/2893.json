It's a well built, quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired USB 2.0 cable for connection to the computer.  There's really not much to say except that it works ---- simple setup, plug and wait for drivers to load and install --- then use the drive.  How hard is that?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good External Floppy Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1392595200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2014"}
