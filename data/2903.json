Works great sending signal from my computer to outdoor location (approximately 50 feet through a wall with window).  It is a little testy when I first turn it on, often requiring slight adjustments to the tuning to find the proper signal frequency.  Every once in a while I think uncontrollable outside static also causes issues, requiring me to readjust the frequency on the transmitter and receiver.  But once working, I've rarely had to make adjustments--and it plays just fine for hours.I have not used batteries yet, so I do not know the life when playing music without AC plug-in.  But overall, it has been an excellent purchase and far simpler than wiring outdoor speakers, at least for now.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great quality wireless speaker for price", "unixReviewTime": 1153353600, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2006"}
