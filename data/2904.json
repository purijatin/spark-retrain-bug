This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Stay far away! Zero stars", "unixReviewTime": 1151107200, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2006"}
