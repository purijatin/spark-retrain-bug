The range isn't nearly what was advertised.  It says 150 feet, but I can barely get them to work across the room.  It's even worse in a two-story house.  God forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside.  They are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying, high-pitched whine.  Even the slight motion can interfere with the signal. I should have returned them when I had the chance.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This is junk", "unixReviewTime": 996105600, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2001"}
