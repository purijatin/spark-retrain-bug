Ray", "helpful": [78, 82], "reviewtext": "I love the digital music channels provided through my cable TV service, and I wanted to be able to listen to this music outside. I just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing CDs--especially when I had great music playing inside the house.The speaker has exceeded my expectations. If you read the directions carefully and follow them step-by-step, you'll have good sound outdoors, too. I was up and running with tunes oustide within ten minutes. I needed another five minutes to fine tune, which was easily accomplished by reading the instructions and the troubleshooting guide. (If you refuse to read instructions or to show a little patience, you get what you deserve.)Contrary to what you may have read in other reviews, if the unit is set up correctly, the sound is NOT thin. The bass is substantial and even with the volume set to maximum, there is no distortion. I set up the speaker (loud!) and strolled my entire yard perimeter, as well as the far side of my neighbor's yard, and could hear everything perfectly. I used the cordless phone right next to the unit--no problem. The distance from my stereo to the backyard is the entire depth of the house--about 60 feet--with signal passing through several plaster and brick walls. I found that it's important to place the transmitter up as high as you can. That solved the few little sound problems I had at setup. What can I say? It sounds great and I love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Let's disturb the neighbors!", "unixReviewTime": 1058313600, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2003"}
