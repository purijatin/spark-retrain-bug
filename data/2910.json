No static or distortion on CD or radio once I &quot;tuned&quot; in the box.  Unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble.  Make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weather!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Looking, Works Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1055721600, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2003"}
