MURPHY", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewtext": "Although I own two indoor Advent wireless speakers which are excellent, this one is horrible. Constant static whether from a radio or CD. It has trouble tuning to the stereo although it used the same transmittor(755)as my indoor speakers. Actually it was closer to the stereo. But it never held a static-free sound regardless of position. I am going to buy a third indoor speaker, use it on the screen porch and occasionally on the deck. Much better sound with speaker and tweeter.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not good, do not buy this speaker.", "unixReviewTime": 1099785600, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2004"}
