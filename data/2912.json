The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound. On occasion, especially very humid days, it's harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal, but overall we're happy with the product.If you can buy the speaker at a deep discount, like we did, then you'll be happy with the product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worth the price", "unixReviewTime": 1153008000, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2006"}
