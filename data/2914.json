And this is shocking, because usually ADVENT MAKES GREAT SPEAKERS.To give you a sense of perspective, realize that I do not demand or own ultra-high end components.  My entire set-up cost less than 1500 dollars (includes: amp, 6 cd changer, dvd player and 2 boston acoustic floor speakers).I purchased the AW810 unit to play light jazz or rock (I'm over 30 -- ouch!), out on my deck.  I thought it would help take the edge off the day (the music, along with an extra dry martini).  Instead of being smoothed by the hip-cat sounds of Miles Davis or The Dead, I found myself constantly running to the speaker to retune it (oftentimes causing me to spill my drink -- ouch again!).Net/net:1) Sound is thinner than a razor blade2) Range is abysmal -- and you actually have to \"tune\" the speaker to get reception3) My unit turned orange after being exposed to sunlight for a week (I'm not kidding!)4) The volume of this unit can be drowned out by a snoring cricket5) This speaker simply does not meet the high standards that Advent has set for their other speakers", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Stop right now, do not pass go...", "unixReviewTime": 1037059200, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2002"}
