For the first hour or so, I was extremely frustrated with this product.  I tried changing the frequency, the volume of the transmitting speaker, and the location of the wireless speaker a few times, with no luck, no sound.  After some fiddling it would transmit sound for about one second and then go silent.  It finally sounded like it had blown.  It got very loud, very staticky (sp?), and then went silent.  The power light turned on and off.  It did this about three times.  I was about to give up.  I gave it one more go, and it worked!!!  I kept the frequency, and even moved the speaker a couple of times to see how it would operate.  It is still working.  It is not a high end speaker, but for the price, and what I am using it for.  I am very pleased.  It does what I bought it for.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good speaker", "unixReviewTime": 1147219200, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2006"}
