I am able to pick up some really distant AM stations and I am also able to pick up many shortwave stations only using the small built in telescoping antenna that it has. Performance is not as good as my larger SW and ham radios that I own but all in all I rate it very good for it size and performance. This model is no longer being produced but you may be able to locate a used one that is in descent condition.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Grundig Mini 100 PE Review", "unixReviewTime": 1281744000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2010"}
