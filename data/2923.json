The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasn't able to pick up anything. But then again, I didn't really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON: The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Grundig M100 Portable radio", "unixReviewTime": 1189209600, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2007"}
