The AM reception is 'good' but not great. It takes some getting used to the backwards tuning dial which goes high to low which is the opposite of most other radios. What I like best about it is that it is very small & sturdy. I believe I have had the same batterys in it for over a year now and have not had to replace them. It does not get heavy use as I said earlier the reception is not what I had hoped but still gets several hours every week of play time.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice radio for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1198281600, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2007"}
