So, not having anything to compare it to, this is a good radio.  On the AM/FM side, I am hearing radio stations I didn't know were available.  On the shortwave end, I am amazed what is coming in.  In the short time I've owned this, I've heard Bolivia, Cuba, and either French Canada or some other french speaking nation, as well as many spanish speaking stations.  If nothing else, this is a good \"beginner\" radio.  Yes, the reception on the SW side are a smidge in and out, but it's ok.  At this point I am just in amazement at what I am able to hear.  There may be better radios out there; as I delve into this more, maybe I'll get them.  But this is good for me just starting out and is fairly easy to figure out.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My first", "unixReviewTime": 1232841600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2009"}
