It has a good digital tuner, decent reception, an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals, etc.  However the design of the unit has several short comings.The biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off!  Leave it on the shelf, and in a few weeks it'll be dead.  To add insult to the injury, all the features that require memory (channels, alarms) are lost when the batteries die.The second is the construction is not very sturdy.  The grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around.  And the telescoping antenna - like all - is a failure waiting to happen (and it did).I'm looking for a unit that has comparable features, but is more sturdy, has better power management, and non-volatile memory.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Many Shortcomings", "unixReviewTime": 1313625600, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2011"}
