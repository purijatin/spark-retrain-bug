Its sensitivity is almost as good as my Grundig 400PE, but some of the other specs aren't quite as good which I would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the 400 PE.  Its power consuption is better than  the 400 PE too.  It's smaller size (than the 400 PE), very good designed,  easy to use controls, good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value.  I like this radio's abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency I am interested in.  This is a fine little radio--- four stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Grundig 300PE", "unixReviewTime": 950918400, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2000"}
