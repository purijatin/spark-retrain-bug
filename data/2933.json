Harrell\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "This radio has good sound for a radio this small with verylittle overload on FM. Not quite as selective as the Yacht Boy 400, but good. Better than the Sangean 220 and my Sony walkman.The AM is good for nighttime listening, but daytime listeninghas some interference. The shortwave reception is average, even though it doesn't cover all the bands. The thing I like most about this radio is that it's easy to carry around.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Lightweight Portable Radio!", "unixReviewTime": 1130630400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2005"}
