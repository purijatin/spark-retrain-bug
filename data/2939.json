I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works with DVD Recorders, too!", "unixReviewTime": 1125964800, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2005"}
