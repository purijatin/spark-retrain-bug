It has the highest screen resolution for its form factor (7\") and is a pleasure to read and write with. Netflix & Hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it's so darn light. Being able to expand the memory with a micro SD card is just another plus. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with it an would recommend it highly!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "compact and useful", "unixReviewTime": 1368489600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2013"}
