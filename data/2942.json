I inserted the cleaner per instructions, followed the instructions on screen but it failed to complete the cleaning process.  Ejected, tried again, same thing.  On the third go, the cycle was completed.  Unfortunately, DVDs continue to freeze.  So, maybe the Polk is a dud.  In any case, the cleaner didn't fix it and it's tough to know which product is faulty.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Far from perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1371168000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2013"}
