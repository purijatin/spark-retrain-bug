I had to add a comment after reading the other reviews.  I AM NOT ALONE!!  These errors have been a continual headache, and from what I see from the reviews, turning to Sony will be to no avail.  Ah well, Sony has lost a DVD customer.  I have the Wega which is a great picture so I'm not uniformly prejudiced against Sony products.  And the DVD player when it has worked has been great. But the hitches have increased in frequency until lately I simply get No disc error.  The reader scans back and forth for about 20 seconds until it gives up.  And I'm giving up, too.  I am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem... points to a generalized issue which I hope Sony can take care of.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "No disc/C13:00", "unixReviewTime": 1037318400, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2002"}
