Although the picture and sound are stunning.  If you feel the need to make them even better, The 550  gives you virtualy unlimited control.  And it will save the settings for  two hundred discs.  Just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are  recalled.  But beware if you are moving to DVD after years with a VHS that  flashed 12:00, opt for a simpler player.  Otherwise, you will be paying for  a something that you can't control.  The Sony 330 will deliver fantastic  picture and sound, for $150 less.  And, as far as the sync problems that  many have reported, I have had the player for two weeks now and have had no  problems what so ever.  Even after checking out many of the reported  problem scenes listed in other reviews.  DVD is the future of home video.  Don't take my word, just look around yourself.  If you're ready to buy,  don't wait.  You won't regret it for a minute.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This One Does It All!", "unixReviewTime": 945734400, "reviewTime": "12 21, 1999"}
