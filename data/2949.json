It offers a tremendous combination of features and performance at a very reasonable price.  I had a year and a half old Panasonic DVD player that decided to stop working and I realize now that it  really did me a favor.  Seeing and hearing movies on this Sony has really  opened my eyes and ears to all that DVDs can offer. I mention ears because  as amazing as the video quality is, the sound quality is what really blows  me away (and you don't need a humongous sound system to appreciate it). You  will not be disappointed by this product! It provides very near the quality  level of the Sony Reference DVD-S7700 (at half the price) and features  (inc. a jog dial remote) that put it over the Sony DVD-S530 (at least in my  book).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Can't Miss DVD Player", "unixReviewTime": 947030400, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2000"}
