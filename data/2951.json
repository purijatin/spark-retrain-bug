This one's audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on dual-layer DVDs. My previous one, Sony's PBD-V30, couldn't play the second layer of any DVD  without skipping. I took that one back and the dealer couldn't get  replacement parts from Sony. I love Sony's design and features, but I  wonder about their quality anymore.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A great player if you don't care about lip-sync", "unixReviewTime": 939772800, "reviewTime": "10 13, 1999"}
