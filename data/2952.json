Case in point was my purchase of this DVD player.  It broke after 3 months with a C:13 error.  I took it in, and they shipped it back to me 2 weeks later.  It then broke 1 1/2 months in the exact same way.  I took it in, and it was fixed for 6 months before breaking in the exact same way.  It was out of warranty this time, but because it had been defective so many times they fixed it.  Well, you guessed it.  Now it is broken again.When the machine works, it is great.  But it has broken too many times for my tastes.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Has Broken 4 Times", "unixReviewTime": 1015200000, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2002"}
