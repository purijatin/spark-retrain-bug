Documentation is terrible. You'll be hard pressed to find even the most basic instructions in the manual.2. Software is buggy and will cause your system to lock up on  occasaion.The player itself is very good. I would also suggest looking  at the Rave MP2100 MP3 player before you make up your mind.Though this is a  neat little machine, I am not sure that the USB option works as fast as  it's touted in the promotional literature. Recommended with some  hesitation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good machine but poor documentation", "unixReviewTime": 952646400, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2000"}
