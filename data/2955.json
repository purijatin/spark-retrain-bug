It has all the features I wanted, pretty good battery life, and is a perfect size.PROS:-Basic, easy to use interface.-Decent battery life, although not as long as the manufacturer claims.CONS:-I hate the software interface. It is slow, unstable and poorly designed. I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device.-As of firmware version 2.15 (availible from ftp://ftp.s3.com/pub/multimedia/rio/rio500_firmware_215.exe), the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb, to give it 128mb of total memory. Although this is a decent amount, 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper....-There is no Windows XP support with the included software. It will work with XP using 3rd party software, which, consequently, is better than the included software...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Player, ...
