It is light, smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible (audio books) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly, with a checkerboard screen].  A quick search at Rio's website (rioworld.org) revealed a recovery utility, which I ran and recovered my Rio's firmware.
