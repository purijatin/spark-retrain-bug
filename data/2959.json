Needs better headphones, although they feel snug and secure.  Also, it  would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in Mic or Input  for a Lapel Mic.  That would blow minidisk out of the water.  I must say  however that this is the future at its best.  No moving Parts, removable  Smart Media Cards used to expand memory.  The Future of music does not  involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk.  I've allready downloaded a  ton of online books and music, and the quality is great......and remember,  MP3's can be be converted back to a standard .Wav file with just about any  MP3 editor....Try Music Match......A great product David_Carlin@vtel.com", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice, but needs some more features", "unixReviewTime": 967766400, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2000"}
