It's also far and away the best bet for Macintosh owners.As others have noted, the only  downsides are the lack of an AC adapter and the horrible headphones that  come with the unit.  This may be a bit subjective, but the design of the  unit itself is also a bit uninspiring.The unit is, however, extremely  small, light, and portable.  You won't mind taking it with you in your coat  pocket, although I'm not quite sure if it would be appropriate for jogging  (I wouldn't know where to put it).  Don't be fooled by the packaging which  is overly large and cumbersome, the device inside is smaller than it  appears.Oh, one last nitpick, battery life is pretty short.  I would  recommend using two sets of good rechargeable AA batteries, otherwise  you'll be buying new batteries every other day!The Rio is a lot like an  IBM ThinkPad.  It's perhaps not the sexiest device on the market, and it's  a little bit more costly than some other options, but it does everything a  bit better than the competition and will last (making that bit more you  spent up-front more than worthwhile).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Great First Time Buyer's Device", "unixReviewTime": 954892800, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2000"}
