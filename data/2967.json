The technology is so tantalizing, but the realization through the Rio 500 is so bug-ridden that it drove me crazy.  I  am returning the product.  Some of the problems:o The software from  Diamond or from Audible to program the Rio is truly horrid, the worst  software I've seen in many years.  It crashes so frequently that you will  be pulling your hair out.o The documentation is a joke! The  &quot;manual&quot; is two pages long. And no, the product isn't intuitive  so you don't need a manual. Look forward to lots of trial and error as you  learn it yourself.Actually, the hardware part is OK and the sound is  joyous on those rare occasions when you can get it programmed. But for me,  the trouble overwhelms the joy.  I'll be returning mine and looking at a  Creative Nomad or some next-generation MP3 player.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "neat technology, but immature product", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
