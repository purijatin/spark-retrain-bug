You must either use a Mac (works great with iTunes), the Riositude program (freeware, google for it)or win98. I use mine whenever Im outside:running, yardwork whatever. You'll need to replace the earbuds  but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone else's earbuds? The serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggested.Also, if you buy a used one, make sure you get the USB cable. It's proprietary and you can't get it anywhere. (Refer to rio support coments below.)Customer support at rio (or sonic blue or whatever they call themselves this week) is a joke. I will not buy another product of any type from them ever.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good player, terrible company", "unixReviewTime": 1068681600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2003"}
