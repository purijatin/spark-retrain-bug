It shipped without instructions of any kind (from Audible) but they are available on the web.Mine doesn't play MP3s well, they sound fuzzy and distorted. As I use mine primarily for audio books it's not a huge issue. If you get one, check it right away for playing quality. I didn't and they won't allow me to return it now.My biggest complaint is it's sensativity. If I bump it, it resets to the beginning of the audio track or song. I don't know if their other products do this but this one is awful in that regard.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Rio 500", "unixReviewTime": 1006128000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2001"}
