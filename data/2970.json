Ruzicka \"John R\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "The RIO 500 is great for gym workouts, train listening, etc.  It's small, light and sounds good enough for listening in an environment with ambient noise.My biggest complaint is the RIOPort software.  There is NO SIMPLE WAY to download songs directly to the device from a folder or CD ROM.  Instead, you have to import the songs into a database and then create playlists.  If you move songs from one subdirectory to another, you have to manually edit database entries for every song that you moved--a tedious and time-consuming process.  If you re-add the songs to the database after the move, you get duplicate entries, only one of which is valid.  However, you can't tell which entry is the valid one.Another gripe--after paying this much money for an audio player, it seems wrong to have to shell out another $9.95 to unlock the software.In short--great product once you get the songs loaded, but reaching that point is frustrating at times.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Product but Crappy Software", "unixReviewTime": 978048000, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2000"}
