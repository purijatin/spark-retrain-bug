Its size (smaller than a pack of cigarettes) and weight (about an oz.) recommend it to shirt-pocket musicophiles and,  especially, athletes! (You can jog all day with nary a skip, and with the  included netting belt-clip, it will definitely NOT pull your jogging shorts  down, weighing about the same as a pager.)Interface with any USB  Macintosh is seamless, and the included software, Casady &amp; Greene's  SoundJam MP, is the finest Mac application in decades.  All you need to  know is how to work the plug, and how to drag and drop, and you'll be  organizing your Rio playlists with no trouble.  If it isn't already,  SoundJam will become your MP3 player of choice, too.The Rio takes  SmartMedia cards and can reportedly handle any size, including the upcoming  100+ MB cards; mine works perfectly with a 32 MB Sandisk SmartMedia card.  (96 MB is just about perfect for listening to a full 72-minute CD  recording, say of Beethoven's Fifth, at 160 kbps sound quality.)I also  get great sound out of a phones-to-cassette adapter, which I use to  playback MP3's in my car.  My only complaint is that the included ear-beads  are terrible, both acoustically and for the fact that they just won't stay  in!  Alternative headphones can be used, but drain the power source (1 AA  battery) rather quickly.  A solution might be NiMH high capacity  rechargables.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seamless integration with the Mac platform", "unixReviewTime": 961545600, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2000"}
