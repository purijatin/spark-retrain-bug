Battery life is so-so.  Good support from manufacturer.  You can get firmware updates easily at their website.  Comes with a &quot;card&quot;, not a manual.  But there is a good manual, and a printable version, at the RIO website.  Provided headphones stink.  You can get a NICE leather case from the Sonicblue website store.  64mb stores a lot of music.  I added 64mb card, which are coming down nicely in price.  I have two RIO500's, one for music, and one for my audio books.  Decent headphone volume. Display with latest firmware is sometimes hard to read.  If you pull the USB plug during download, or if download is interrupted, the RIO will lock up, good.  BUT, Sonicblue tech support website does have program you can download for free that will fix it (usually).  This happened to me, and the program worked fine!Right now, I think it is good buy.  The other RIO MP3 players use expensive memory &quot;backpacks&quot;, or rechargable batteries (RIO800).  I prefer alkalines.  Regular rechargable AA batteries are not recommended for the 500.I think it's a great unit.  5 stars easily!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great machine.  Easy to use.
