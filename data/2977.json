Now I can have just one wire (s-video) going to my TV.  The JVC VCR has a nice feature in that when you change channels up/down, included in the list is  Line-1 (where I input from my dish).  So, after the highest TV channel it  just goes to the dish input -- nice!  I don't need the TV remote except to  turn the thing on.  Also, any time I want to play a tape, I just put in a  tape and run it and it just takes over the TV picture.  The instructions  were not clear on the 'plug/play' hookup.  It didn't seem to be working but  I left it alone for a while and it was OK.  It just needed to find the time  signal from my local PBS station which is only sent once per hour -- I hope  that's helpful. I haven't tried it with an S-VHS tape.  A complaint I have  is that when useing S-VHS ET with a regular VHS tape, there is no indicator  that shows the quality that it allowed itself to record at.  One could  argue that one could just observe the tape, post recording.  However, I'd  like to try a tape to see if that important movie will record on *that*  tape in a high quality.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Simplifies Hookup", "unixReviewTime": 947203200, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2000"}
