It can record and play S-VHS and VHS tapes,  with the former providing superior playback using the 2-hours recording  mode and an S-VHS tape.  It auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote.  The best S-VHS machine in this price range.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for recording from Satellite Receivers", "unixReviewTime": 940982400, "reviewTime": "10 27, 1999"}
