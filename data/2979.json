Gibson", "helpful": [6, 8], "reviewtext": "I'm pleased with the VCR, but it took about an hour to get it set up properly.  Plug &amp; play didn't work.  I finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually, and the initial configuration is relatively  complicated.  I am a little bit disappointed with the remote.  One reason  that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well  with my other JVC components, but the remote is awkward to use with my TV  and DBS.  Overall though, it has a lot of nice features for the money, and  the picture quality is good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "nice unit, but complicated", "unixReviewTime": 956620800, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2000"}
