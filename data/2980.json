Day", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "I got this JVC video tape player a long time ago and guess I paid about $100 for it back then. It's the only VCR we have now that still works and don't eat up VHS tapes. I got it because of the S/Video and I can play are old VHS tapes with S/Video to a DVD recorder S/Video input to save are old VHS tapes to DVD. With the way are other VCR's are not working and messing up VHS tapes it is very good to get them saved to DVD and this is about the best way using S/Video.-Raymond Day", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good player to save videos to DVD.", "unixReviewTime": 1146096000, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2006"}
