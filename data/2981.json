The picture quality is even further raised with features like VIDEO STABLIZER, VIDEO CALIBRATION, and you can change the sharp tone to \"SHARP\" for a sharp picture, \"SOFT\" for a smooth picture, and \"AUTO\" for use with VIDEO CALIBRATION. This VCR is the most reliable I have ever seen. Sometimes the picture quality is better that DVD recorders. Unlike DVD recorders, there are certain tapes that can record HDTV. Use that tape with its Super Video connection, and you will have a knock-out.When you hook up your antenna to the VCR, then from the VCR, to the T.V., you get a super clear picture. (For antenna users) It also has VCR plus, so you can connect it to your cable box and it will automatically record for you, A S-Video connection, HI-FI, and an MTS decoder.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best VCR", "unixReviewTime": 1119484800, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2005"}
