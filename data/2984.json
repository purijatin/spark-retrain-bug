The floppy disk storage allows for you to take literally thousands of pictures without going back to your computer, and thus gets high marks for portability.  All in all, a great camera, and if you're like me, whenever you take it with you, carry some floppies in your pocket, because you will be taking a lot of pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Marvelous!", "unixReviewTime": 975801600, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2000"}
