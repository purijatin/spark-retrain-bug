Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "good but not great camera", "unixReviewTime": 950140800, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2000"}
