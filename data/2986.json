If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good &quot;snapshot&quot; camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera. How many pictures do you wind up enlarging?  I run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Saves money in the long run", "unixReviewTime": 985651200, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2001"}
