So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&amp;W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Thumbs Up", "unixReviewTime": 981158400, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2001"}
