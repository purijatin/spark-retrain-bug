For auctions, emails, web sites, Etc. this is a fine camera. The advantages are great macros (down to 1&quot;),10X zoom lens, comes with rechagable battery and charger, simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.  However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos (Because of the 640X480 resolution) Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos. For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras. I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera. Only the Nikons have great Macro capability (If this is important) A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460/490.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Wonferful Camera for Internet Use, NOT PHOTOS", "unixReviewTime": 975110400, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2000"}
