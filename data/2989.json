No proprietary cables or special setup is required. Even the newer cameras with the USB interface often require their own goofy PhotoSchmuck software to be installed.The  floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time, even with friends  that have older computers or (God forbid) a Mac. Almost any computer can  read the format-standard JPEG used by the Mavica cameras. You can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere. Try that with a smart card! If you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line, or at the  Olympus 600. If you want to make a living on eBay, or just have fun with  your camera, it's hard to beat the Mavica for convenience and versatility.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Versatile and Convenient", "unixReviewTime": 950486400, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2000"}
