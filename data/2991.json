Pomeroy", "helpful": [20, 21], "reviewtext": "Simple, and easy to use for what it does, this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays. On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to  use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good  enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to  do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool,  and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything  more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with  a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Limited", "unixReviewTime": 958694400, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2000"}
