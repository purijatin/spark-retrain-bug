Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say &quot;Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!&quot;).At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow, a 10x zoom!", "unixReviewTime": 963100800, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2000"}
