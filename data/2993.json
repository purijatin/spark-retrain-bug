I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second &quot;movie&quot;. Boy  do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for  my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since  the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a  digital camera that is easy to use. Thanks Amazon for providing the  reviews, and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews. I  found them very helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for a beginner", "unixReviewTime": 956620800, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2000"}
