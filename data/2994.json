What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good, not great", "unixReviewTime": 978480000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2001"}
