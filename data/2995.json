You can take the pictures in many conditions. The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting. You can use the A-REC mode for automatic shooting &amp; M-REC mode for manual Shooting. You will have a great photos just using A-REC mode. Just switch on the bottom &amp; ready to take photos. If you want more professional photos use M-REC mode. You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture. In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light. The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web, sending though E-mail &amp; print in A4 paper. The worst think that I know is a battery live. This camera it's so hungry with power, that I thought same with the others digicam. For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries, which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used. You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Digital Camera with many feature", "unixReviewTime": 977616000, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2000"}
