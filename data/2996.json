I email pictures to family regularly.  The quality is matchless, but I have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over 1 meg.The quality is so exquisite, that (get this) got a  color matched fabric from a friend in NY based on a close up picture I took  of a printed upholstery piece.  I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.  I even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it.  I now have 6, having  asked everyone I know for one for presents.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Hassle but Worth It", "unixReviewTime": 944092800, "reviewTime": "12 2, 1999"}
