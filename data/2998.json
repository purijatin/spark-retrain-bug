It's quite easy to use, and perfect for the beginner.  The only real gripes I have are the limitations in the size of the Compact Flash it uses, and the fact that after a time, the battery compartment won't stay closed.  Otherwise, I've taken some fantastic pictures with this camera!  In fact, I'd have to say it does better than some of the newer Nikon Coolpix cameras (like the L18, which I also have).  I've found newer models to have focus and flash issues, as well as severe shutter lag.  This may not be comparable in resolution, but it's quite enough for most uses.  You don't need more than 2.1 MegaPixel for decent resolution unless you're doing huge blow-ups of photographs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Starter Digital Camera", "unixReviewTime": 1229817600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2008"}
