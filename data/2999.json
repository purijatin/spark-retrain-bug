With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care  because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to  just &quot;go for it.&quot; After blowing through several dozen test pics,  I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital  simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera.  The quality of the pictures, once you get the hang of using the camera in a  particular setting, is amazing. This is the highest digital quality I've  experienced with a digital camera.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great camera--a little difficult to use", "unixReviewTime": 940896000, "reviewTime": "10 26, 1999"}
