The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 (shown here).  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 (3.34 Megapixels). It's a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive, and if you don't need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as &quot;top of the  line.&quot;The swiveling body on the 900, 950, and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down, or at your knees  with the lens looking up, and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display, because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras don't do this and it's really useful. It's  made possible by the fact that these cameras (especially the 990) are so  good at autofocus, autoexposure, and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot, not worry about  anything else, and get a great result.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Check the 990 model before purchasing", "unixReviewTime": 966816000, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2000"}
