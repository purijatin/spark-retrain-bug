The one I got looked like it was hardly used at all! It was out of the box but came with all accessories, the memory card, the case to protect it, lens cap, all user manuals...I got this camera to try to learn how to do Infrared photography. I have to say, it's an amazing camera! I wish I had this camera when it was released in 1999! I pretty much turned the camera on, and it worked amazingly! I used the adapter I bought on amazon to fix a 52m filter on and I have actually obtained amazing pictures! I am really enjoying infrared photography so far, and I am moving onto ultraviolet photography next. I am doing this all for fun and my own enjoyment. I didn't want to mod my Nikon d3100...so this is the next best thing. For about 30 bucks I have this camera, the adapter, and the infrared filter. I have to say if you are looking to do some interesting things with your photography and are not willing to mod your high end camera, this is a great 2nd option. Affordable also... =)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera for odd photography!", "unixReviewTime": 1348790400, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2012"}
