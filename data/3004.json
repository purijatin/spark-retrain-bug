The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically.The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create &quot;red eye&quot; a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.) I'd suggest getting at least 8 AA  batteries.I do suggest getting extra memory (I have 32 megs) and one of  those USB memory card readers, its a lot faster than a serial port.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Gorgeous images, easy to use, needs better Flash", "unixReviewTime": 958089600, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2000"}
