Rasmussen", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "This camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the Nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer.  It is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera.  I have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother, the quality was so poor.  This camera is the best I have seen and I would highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A wonderful digital camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1006041600, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2001"}
