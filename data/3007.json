The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment.  I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it.  I have not been  disappointed yet by the quality.  Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a  64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Holy Macro", "unixReviewTime": 941587200, "reviewTime": "11 3, 1999"}
