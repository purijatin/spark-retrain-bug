The first surprise came as we started to use it.  As has been noted at length by another reviewer on this page, these labelers are designed to waste the tape.  OK, we thought.  Whatever.Then, when the tape ran out, we purchased more via Amazon.  Wow, these refills are unreasonably expensive!  Brother clearly has a \"give away the razors and sell the blades\" philosophy, seemingly making all of their money on the tape.  But we bought it anyway, cause what else were we going to do?  We were stuck.We got the tape, inserted it correctly.  But the cartridge was faulty and it unraveled on the second label.  Irreperable.  So we called Brother and -- guess what -- the tapes have NO WARRANTY!!So, unless you are in the mood to give Brother a *blank check* for your labeling needs, don't get into bed with them.  They will leave you angry and wanting.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "No warranty on these!  Buyer beware!", "unixReviewTime": 1105401600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2005"}
