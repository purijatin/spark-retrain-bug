But I only just now needed a new cartridge.  So don't hold back; label EVERYTHING!  These labels are high quality.  They stick until (unless) you remove them, then they come up without leaving any residue.  You can even restick them!  And because they are thermally activated, the \"ink\" won't smear if it gets wet.  I couldn't be more satisfied (except the backing is so hard to get off...).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great tape for a great labeler", "unixReviewTime": 1340236800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2012"}
