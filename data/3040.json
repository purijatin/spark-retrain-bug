I have owned the Brother P-touch PT-65 for many years now and I love it. I am so much more organized. But this is about the tape. I use this tape on everything - file folders, plastic containers, metal, cardboard, everything except I don't think I've ever put it on wood. The most difficult thing is peeling the label from the backing. Some days it's easy, some days not so much. The key is to gently rub the pad of your thumb over the edge of a corner of the tape. Usually this separates the tape from the backing enough to peel it off. The tape sticks very well - I've even washed over the labels several times before it started to peel up on the corners - but it also peels off easily except from paper. It always seems a little expensive to me but one cartridge lasts forever.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've Been Using for Years", "unixReviewTime": 1326153600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2012"}
