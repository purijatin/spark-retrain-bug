Chaika \"book, movie, tech lover\"", "helpful": [40, 40], "reviewtext": "If you buy this from a B&N; store, and are a member of B&N;, you can get this for $174, which is cheaper than the 8 gig Fire. If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use? I actually got thre 16gig Tablet but the 8 gig is as fast and has the 11 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Biggest Deal Around", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2012"}
