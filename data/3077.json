This standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time.  Will not stick on large plastic containers very well, but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar, coffee, decaf, flour, etc.I wish Brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels.  It takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itself.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Labeling Madness", "unixReviewTime": 1199059200, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2007"}
