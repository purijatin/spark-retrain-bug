I do not see the need to buy another tablet because I do not allow them to play with it too much. My oldest child uses it for email, news, weather, and more while in school. She prefer it to a computer even she has to share with her sister and brother. it starts in seconds, it weights less and is firm enough to be put in her school bag (with cover of cause).It has the convenient access to the free Istory books, free classical books, and some games that my children occasionally play with. My older children would record some of the books for my smaller children to listen. It save me a lot of time to read to them. The dictionary is at their fingers.Not a bad gadget for education.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for education", "unixReviewTime": 1349654400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2012"}
