One cartridge lasts me forever.  I can label anything, including my children's ice packs and cups.  They stay on in the freezer and in the dishwasher.  The ink doesn't smudge, but after a few years of going through the dishwasher, the ink may fade.  If I need to, I just peel off and make another one.  As long as the surface is non-porous, it comes off when I need it to without any trouble without leaving any residue.  What's not to like?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So many reasons to like this P-Touch tape", "unixReviewTime": 1259798400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2009"}
