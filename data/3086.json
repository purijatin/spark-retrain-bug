(Of course, I do love Name Bubbles for the &#34;serious&#34; kid gear/clothes labeling tasks.  I get frustrated when I am out of labels, and having more color options available through Amazon is a good thing.  Having more label tape is good as my kids find the label printer and start printing random stuff.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Label All The Things!", "unixReviewTime": 1378339200, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2013"}
