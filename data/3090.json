I have been using a P-Touch for years, and love it. Practically indestructible. The one I have at my office has to be over 10 years old. Just bought a new P-Touch for home, and hope I get the same service from it. Anyway, the Brother replacement tapes have always been reliable, print well, and they are durable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Economical way to buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2014"}
