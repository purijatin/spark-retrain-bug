I have been using Brother products for years but I especially like this purchase because I can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and UPS can locate the tenant for deliveries.  It is a great purchase and I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler", "unixReviewTime": 1369008000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2013"}
