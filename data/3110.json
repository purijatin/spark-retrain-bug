But...I would rather pay for a slightly larger labeling machine in order to get a MUCH LARGER (and longer) tape cartridge. If Brother were to increase the label tape length, it would only cost PENNIES to do so.Is Brother's profit important enough to damage the company's public reputation? Why not offer a more equitable cost/value ratio to customers? If the company (Brother) had GIVEN me the labelling machine free of charge, I would be more agreeable to their high prices of the consumables.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quantity/Price Ratio Off Kilter", "unixReviewTime": 1178928000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007"}
