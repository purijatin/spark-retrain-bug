It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you're ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy to Peel Off", "unixReviewTime": 1251331200, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2009"}
