I really like and don't like features of this tablet.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the Nook.LIKE:1.  layout and function of touch screen is intuitive - the Kindle Fire requires instruction2.  built-in wi-fi3.  the hardware is solid4.  the price is competitive5.  Netflix and Hulu are available and app market is expandingDON'T LIKE:1.  no bluetooth or GPS2.  do not have access to the full Android Market3.  no video rental option - apple and Amazon tablet have better market places4.  only 8 GB memory and although it can be expanded with microSD, less convenient than other tablets5.  the e-reader is not as good as a Kindle but then what is?  at least the iPad allows for the Kindle appFor now, I'm sticking with my Kindle Fire over this Nook but I'm keeping my options open for future purchases.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "MIXED FEELINGS", "unixReviewTime": 1340755200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2012"}
