At $200 list price I would say it's a rip-off and I'm still not thrilled that I spent $150 on it.Pros:  Expandable storage via micro-sd.Reliably plays mp4 video and e-book files.Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are reliable and have good interfaces.Reliable (but not particularly long-distance) wireless antennae.Bright screen with good color, contrast, and resolution.Responsive touch screen.Good battery life.Cons:  Web browser is slow, unreliable, and crashes often.Limited, closed operating system with expensive applications.Headphone jack is low-rent - too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakers.Horizontal / Vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization options.Made from cheap plastic - micro-sd cover slot fell off.No way to rent movies or TV episodes from Nook store.Hard-to-use music player that has problems playing some mp3s that other devices can play just fine.It's good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a touch-screen portable computer. If other tablets were priced in the same $150 range I would have rather got something a lot more customizable with access to free apps.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Meh - Some buyer's remorse", "unixReviewTime": 1345852800, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2012"}
