This is a versatile labeling tape for many uses.  The split tape is now easier to remove from the backing, BUT, as another reviewer stated, due to static cling, the bits are sometimes difficult to throw away.  Still a FIVE STAR product, though!UPDATE NOV 2012:  After we fell in love with theEpson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Maker (C51CB70010)where the tapes were more reasonably pricedEpson LabelWorks Standard Tape Cartridge (Black on White) (~1/2 Inch, ~30 Feet) (LC-4WBN9)(competition is good.. now Brother has the better pricing for tapes! so lesson learned is keep an eye on both... or perhaps the answer is to buy one of each unit so you can always get the least expensive tapes?!) and had a better selection such as theEpson LabelWorks Metallic LC Tape Cartridge ~3/4-Inch Black on Gold (LC-5KBM9)and the high visibilityEpson LabelWorks Fluorescent LC Tape Cartridge ~3/4-Inch Black on Yellow (LC-5YBF9)we've been hooked on our Epson and it's tapes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value, so many uses!", "unixReviewTime": 1267920000, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2010"}
