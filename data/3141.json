I tried one of the \"photos pens\" from Amazon but it leaked through the paper and ruined a photo. This is not only permanent but looks professional. The cost is secondary here to the functionality. PS - By adjusting the margin setting, printing on the middle font size, and using the return key to create a two line label, you can save valuable tape. Using the \"memory\" function you can avoid typing common entries too many times.Agreed the tape is expensive but it is a class act.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Used for priceless photos - Genealogy", "unixReviewTime": 1246752000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2009"}
