Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"", "helpful": [57, 58], "reviewtext": "I have used several Brother label makers, all of which use the TZ series tapes.  Of those tapes, my two favorite are black on white in this width and the 3/8\" width.  I prefer the 1/2\" width for hanging file folders because the label fits nicely on the tab.  I like the 3/8\" width (TZ-221) for use with manila folders because the narrower width positions closer to the edge of the tab.There is also a 1/2\" tape that is black on clear.  However, the clear tapes also show any dirt or debris that might be trapped behind the tape.  Thus, if you are in an environment that has even a small amount of dirt or other contamination, it may be readily visible against a light background after the tape is positioned.One other caution regarding these tapes; the backing can be difficult to remove.  The newer tape cartridges have a split backing that is easier to remove than the original single piece backing.  Even so, a certain amount of manual dexterity is required to remove the backing.UPDATE:  Since the time I originally wrote this review, Brother has modified the backing to be in two pieces, making the backing easier to remove.  However, the individual backing pieces can be a pain to throw away because they like to stick to just about everything through static electricity.This tape adheres readily; the print is nicely defined and has a high contrast.  The tape can be slightly difficult to handle.  Overall, this tape is very useful in a variety of applications and one of my two favorite label maker tapes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Useful for Hanging File Folder Labels", "unixReviewTime": 1138665600, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2006"}
