That slit down the rear--easy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails, no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive.  What cooler sound than the whirr of a Brother 1280 as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot, ready to take on the world.  File folders, basement shelves, neighborhood cats--231 organizes them all with finesse.  You won't find a better TZ label tape than TZ231.
