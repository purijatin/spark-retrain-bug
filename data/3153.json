The letters are easy to read. Unlike other labels I've used, the backing is easy to peal off. I even labelled the breakers in my electrical panel. I'm glad they have a QWERTY keyboard and not an A-Z dial, makes typing labels a breeze. I recommend typing labels in batches, with a few spaces between each, then print the entire batch, and cut apart with sissors, that minimizes wasted tape.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love my labels", "unixReviewTime": 1234137600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2009"}
