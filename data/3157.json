Salotti \"DS\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I got my wife the P1200 labeler and these tapes to help her objective of organizing the entire house.These tapes work well, a few notes:- black on clear are ok, but black on white show up better.  Picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label -- for that reason, I favor black on white over black on clear.- Certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off -- we found 1&#34; work best on 18-gallon storage totes -- 1/2&#34; just doesn't seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time.  We use these 1/2&#34; for labeling my daughter's lunch items etc. for daycare.It would be great if Amazon Basics had a replacement item that was a better value -- if you do alot of labeling, these Brother products can get expensive.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for medium size items", "unixReviewTime": 1371945600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2013"}
