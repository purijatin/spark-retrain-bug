It is easier to read than white on black (the letters don't come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes) and black on clear. Black on Clear requires that the background is light or clear. I used to label an old Power Mac G4 Cube computer and it looked great. Other times I tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read.The special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black. Brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life. I have two brother printers: a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by USB model PT-1950. You get free software from brother's website and you can save your labels.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but not as useful as Black on white", "unixReviewTime": 1246406400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2009"}
