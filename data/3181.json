As others have mentioned here, it's really a gray more than silver.  The standard white tape provides labels with a little more visibility and contrast, but this silver is better when you don't want the label to stand out quite so much - I used it to label some components in my a/v setup and like the more understated look.  The black lettering is still very legible and the labels end up looking a tad more elegant on the gray.  If high visibility is priority one, go with white tape.  If you want more subtlety, pick the silver.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Replacement Tape", "unixReviewTime": 1375747200, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2013"}
