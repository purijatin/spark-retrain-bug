It has a ton of features and has a great looking VividView touchscreen. Here are some of the features and things it can do.-Very strong, I dropped mine from 5 feet to wood floor and it was fine.-Very fast but slow at navigating the home screen.-Has a physical home button which comes in handy in case you want to quit something.-Has expandable memory so you can have tons of content on this.-You can personalize the home screen with your own wallpaper.- Loads pages fast and plays videos well.-Has a VividView touchscreen which does what it says and makes everything vivid.-The os is tweaked which is nice if you don't care about android.-The microphone works great .-It has physical volume buttons.Over all this is a very good tablet if you just need to do basics like read,email,play games, play videos and search the web. It can also do more than basics.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1341619200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2012"}
