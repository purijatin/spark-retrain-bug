The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product for money", "unixReviewTime": 1336435200, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2012"}
