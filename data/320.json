I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says \"Nook\"Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a \"Nook\" is not required, it should say, \"Not intended for Nook Devices\". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to \"DeskTop Study\", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not for Students and Professors", "unixReviewTime": 1310947200, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2011"}
