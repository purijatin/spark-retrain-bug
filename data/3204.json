This one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface. Used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools. Fits and works perfectly. Nice to know I can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brother PT-85 Tape Cartridge", "unixReviewTime": 1294531200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2011"}
