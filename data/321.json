The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Could be better", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014"}
