Good product, put together nicely and has tons of features. Minor annoyances: the clip behind the radio is not the best feature, the LCD light does not stay on long enough, and the speaker volume should be louder. Lots of upsides (well covered in other reviews) with some minor but annoying downsides.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good product, works as it should.", "unixReviewTime": 1306972800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2011"}
