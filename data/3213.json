Perfect for this radio. Price is right, easy install, good for a Jeep where there's 0 room for full size perm CB. Did a perm antenna install, ran the coax just to the right of the console, keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when I need it. Can't speak for the portable performance but as an in-car cb, it's perfect for occasional use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Awesome CB for occasional use", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}
