Bought this one as a replacement for my car, and it has been worth the extra money.  It has a lot of nice features on it that you would find in higher end CBs for a lot more.  But, what I like best about it besides the features and portability is it's size and ease-of-handling.  It fits nicely in the cup tray or cd stack in my car.  And, the knobs to adjust the squelch and volume are easy to feel and turn without looking at it (so that I can keep my eyes on the road).  It fits well in the hand and is easy to use.  The sound comes in clear, and others tell me that I'm coming through clear.  The speaker isn't the loudest and pretty directional, so you'll have to move it and face it towards you when trying to hear sometimes.  Otherwise, a great little CB.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great CB for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}
