This radio would be good for a vehicle that didn't have a cb permanent mounted or even a rental when going on vacations to get road reports from semis and to listen to the weather chanel on it. would also be good to have to and talk between two cars on a trip.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "as much as you can expect from a hand held", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2014"}
