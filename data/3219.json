I used to travel aback and forth from Tempe az to Chicago when I was in college.  I used a  mounted, cb for eight years and I relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the 36 hour trip.  So, nostalgia set in before Xmas and I bought this unit. And a second one for my son who commutes to college.  The reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit.  Not good.  I bought a lil Wilson magnet antenna.  On the highway today, my radio checks indicated I was getting a transmission range of 5-8 miles.  Not bad at all.  Brought me back to the college commute.  I recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers (and their kids)  And i should add that the noaa weather channel is great.  Cb radios saved my life a couple of times.  I'm back  in!!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I am impressed with the quality of this product so far", "unixReviewTime": 1293926400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2011"}
