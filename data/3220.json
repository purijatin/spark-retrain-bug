Ride in a club where many members have these. One of the only suitable CB for a bike that doesn't come with an OEM CB. Range will depend on antenna. Rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances. Would guess 1/4 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions. Weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector. Also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses 8 AA rechargeable batteries. I am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit. The other battery pack holds 6 regular AA batteries. Both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options. I don't see why 6 rechargeable batteries couldn't be used i the 6 battery holder. You would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Motorcycle", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014"}
