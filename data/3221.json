It can be used as a walkie talkie, with either 6 regular AA batteries or 8 rechargeable batteries which can be charged while in the radio!!Or you can plug it into your vehicle power point and use it with .... just about any kind of cb antenna you may choose.  Just make sure you check the SWR or have someone do it for you if can't do it yourself!!Good sound quality, both as a CB and as a weather radio.AND, when I got it, from the 'used' department at Amazon (bad idea), it was a couple of weeks before I was able to try the 'rechargeable base' to see if it worked. Everything else did, but this item did not. Having hassled with Amazon's chat function a couple times, I wasn't in the mood to deal with them again, so, a quick email to Midland got me a replacement rechargeable battery box that DID work, no charge, no hassle, 3 days in the mail and I'm VERY impressed with Midlands customer service. THANKS VERONICA!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little CB radio, used either way...handset or walkie talkie", "unixReviewTime": 1395360000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2014"}
