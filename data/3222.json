Both reception and transmission are very clear. Reception from a distant source can be hard to hear on the built-in speaker. I haven't tried a headset yet, but I think that would help. Range with an external antenna is good -- several miles with no problem.Display is good, but I wish the display had a backlight instead of lights off to the sides and I wish there was a way to keep the lights on when plugged into the car adapter. Lit keys for night use would be nice, too.Solid construction. The one I received was flawless.The removable antenna is really convenient. I added a 27\" collapsible to replace the rubber ducky that it comes with to extend the range when using it as a handheld.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Compact, versatile radio", "unixReviewTime": 1277510400, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2010"}
