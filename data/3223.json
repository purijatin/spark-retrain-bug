Which is great when you are traveling convoy-style on a Jeep run or similar activity.  Does it work as well as permanently installed CB?  Maybe not - but this one has worked great for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great portable CB option", "unixReviewTime": 1370304000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2013"}
