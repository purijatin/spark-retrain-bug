The radio moved on the Super Saver Shipping timeline even with mandatory $10 Standard Shipping.  I could have walked to KY for pick-up in the time standard shipping took.  The vehicle mount antenna ordered same day, standard shipping, from Cricket Ventures, AMZ reseller, arrived four days before the radio.On the other hand, the radio and antenna are superb!  An exceptional package of capabilities, size, and features.  Midland would do well to copy this product architecture across their other families of HT/Mobile products: GMRS/MURS, business band.Buy the radio.  Just don't expect timely delivery.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "5-7 business days for Standard Shipping, required", "unixReviewTime": 1151625600, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2006"}
