I have not used a CB Radio in years, so was impressed by the scan feature. 3 ways to power it, and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector, no need to buy adapter. Control buttons located handily, easy to navigate. Can recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great choice", "unixReviewTime": 1330128000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2012"}
