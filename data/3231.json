The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Midland 75-933 40 Ch 2 way CB", "unixReviewTime": 1266192000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2010"}
