This product fit the bill perfectly!  The volume knob was cracked, and I wasn't going to send it back for that so I purchased some 6mm knobs, and trimmed the base ring off of them, and they look even better than the originals.  See:B008DFA0Y0The best part about this unit is the battery packs, one for normal AA, and one for rechargeable NICAD, and a charger too.  This allows you to go portable and mobile.  The wiring set up for in the vehicle works great, and allows you to put the handset between the driver seat and console, and remove it if you don't want to leave it in the vehicle.  The fact that I can use it out of the vehicle too, is what made me buy this one vice the similar Cobra product.  So far it works great, and I've gotten pretty good range mated up to a tuned Firestik Antennae.  Having weather bands as well is a plus.  Great for 4x4 folks in the field.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for use in 2013 Jeep Wranglers!", "unixReviewTime": 1377302400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2013"}
