The CB comes with 2 battery packs, one of which is setup for rechargeable batteries.  It also has the mobile adaptor which allows for the unit to be wired into the car for full power and antenna capability. The battery life is really good.  I can go all day and have plenty of power to keep going.I have a Firestick on the back of the Jeep and this really helps out when surrounded by hills.  The handheld is great if you want to step out of the vehicle and still be able to stay connected.  Swapping back and forth between the mobile adaptor and the battery pack takes all of 2 seconds.  It is simple to swap back and forth multiple times a day. (Especially if someone in your off road group continually gets stuck)  The additional weather band has been convenient to have on a few occasions.I have not had any issues whatsoever with range with the short antenna.  The longest distance I have tested was about a 1/4 mile on an expressway, but the reception was clear as day.  I only use the CB when I am with a group and we typically stay within close proximity of each other.  The Firestick drastically changes/increases the range, of course.....So if you are like me and use your radio for recreational use and want it permanently mounted in your car, then this is absolutely the PERFECT radio for you!  Buy a Firestick with the quick disconnect and you can basically have the entire setup up and running in less than 5 minutes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Happy with this radio!", "unixReviewTime": 1353888000, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2012"}
