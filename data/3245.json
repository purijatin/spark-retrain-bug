Full 4 watt power and weather channels.Has a extra battery pack and I NEVER thought I'd use the phrase: \"batteries NOT included\".You can plug it into the car 12VDC socket and use it with an external antenna, again NOT included. EZ 7-9 mile range with a decent antenna. About 2 mile range with the little antenna that comes with it.Worth the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small size/BIG performer", "unixReviewTime": 1275177600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2010"}
