Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck.  Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Ineffective", "unixReviewTime": 1200700800, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2008"}
