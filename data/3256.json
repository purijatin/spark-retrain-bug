The main reason I ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an in-auto cb.  With the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck.  It also is a good price. If you read the specs and know what you are ordering, then you will not be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good product", "unixReviewTime": 1257120000, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2009"}
