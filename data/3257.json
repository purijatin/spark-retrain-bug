I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it.  I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna.  Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack.  This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn.  This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund.  Spend another $35 to get a full-size name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I Sent It Back", "unixReviewTime": 1327881600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2012"}
