And i'v owned a lot of them since the 1970s! This is so easy to go from totally hand held to a  mobile cb and the sound quality is better than my BIG radio!! Just be sure you match it with your antenna when using it as mobile! As with ALL cb radios this is a must do!! There are good swr meters on amazon (or elsewhere if you prefer)Like just about any truck stop or RadioShack.I would definitely recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a new and very versatile cb radio!! Happy CBing!!  UPDATE: If using in a big rig you may want to use an external speaker with it. I could still hear but found myself straining a bit.It takes all of about 2 seconds to plug in a ext.speaker and well worth it.I also use a retractable Mic.keeper (hooked to belt clip)to quickly install in truck.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome hand held cb", "unixReviewTime": 1334620800, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2012"}
