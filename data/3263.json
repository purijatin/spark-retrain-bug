This radio is a very nice addition!  Hardly ever talk on it, but use it to listen to traffic reports in conjunction with a K30 antenna.  I have received very good reports when i have transmitted with it.  All of it's features work very well as advertised.  I have it mounted in my work truck using a shaped coat hanger. Also, i am using a Radio Shack mic I originally purchased and used for my Icom, and RS ham HTs.  This mic has a 'speaker-out' jack on the connector so I also have an extension speaker hooked up to it.  Has great volume this way, with the convienance of a real mic.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Just get it!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great radio!", "unixReviewTime": 1270339200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2010"}
