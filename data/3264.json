Forget about using it inside a car, it will not pick anything, not even the weather channels. Running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even 3 feet away. Paired with  Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved, there is a lot of noise, making it hard to understand any conversations. The antenna was tunned with a SWR meter to about 2:1, which is great, but noise still present. NOAA channels were clear the first two days but now barely work. Also picks engine noise. Tried using chokes on DC powerline and also on RF but no luck, engine noise still present.I got this to use on my car as I spend quite sometime on the road but for now I'm quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking. It should work right out of the box!Going on a trip to Canada this week so I'll be testing it further (1200mile trip) then i'll decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solution.The idea is great. Love it.The implementation sucks. :(", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not as advertised. Buyer beware.", "unixReviewTime": 1377302400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2013"}
