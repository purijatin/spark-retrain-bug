Poulos", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I was intent on using an old Cobra 19 in my new SUV but when I tested it (hadnt been used in about eight years) there was no transmitting.  It's not worth getting a $40 and 12 year old unit fixed so I was in the market for a new CB.  Sadly there is no room to easily mount a pro size CB in my Xterra and cubbies and flat spots are scarce.The Midland 75-822 along with the Cobra 75 WXST seem to be better than a handheld only CB.  The Cobra may be nice but the Midland is so much more versatile.  You can use the 75-822 inside or outside of the car with battery power (both adapters for alkaline and rechargeable batteries as is a charger for NIMH or NICAD batteries) and a rubber ducky antenna, outside with batteries and antenna or in car with DC power and an external antenna.  With the rubber duck antenna range is very limited for transmitting but it receives CB and weather okay.  With an external antenna you give up nothing over a \"regular\" CB.  I mounted my antenna to the roof rack and have a 2 ft Firestik FS and a 4 foot Firestick Firefly to use as needed. With the 2 foot reception and transmission are worlds apart from the rubber antenna as is weather.  With the 4 foot antenna I get all three NOAA weather stations and two are 30-40 miles away and transmitting can reach out easily 3-5 miles which is fine for legal CB power.  The main cons I have is the lack of a constant backlight and lack of cover for bnc connector when not using the rubber antenna.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Versatile And Packs A Punch", "unixReviewTime": 1330992000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2012"}
