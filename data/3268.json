It's ability to be used in the car/truck with an external antenna, easily hooked up and moved from car to car. OR it can be used as a portable hand held unit. Which is nice if you're a truck driver, backing up and someone is guiding you in the dock, you can hear them over your main CB in the cab.A lot of thought went into this unit. The weather channels, the seperate battery packs. One for rechargeables, and another for regular batteries.Just plug it in to recharge.The quality makes this a solid little unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Little Unit", "unixReviewTime": 1181865600, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2007"}
