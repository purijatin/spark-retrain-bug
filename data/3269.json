If you are going to buy this, to use in your car you \"will\" need to buy a HA-BNC CB ADAPTOR and a ROOF MOUNT ANTENNA or else it will not work inside your car! If you are going to use this for outside! You \"will\" need to buy a HAND HELD RADIO BNC TELESCOPING ANTENNA For longer range use! The small antenna that this comes with has a very short range and you will not be happy with it. Other than that! This is a great radio and has a full 4 watt's output like any other CB radio. I have read some of the bad review's on here and they are so wrong, i had to put my two cents in on this radio! So! Remember,its all about the antenna!!! Thank's", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great CB radio!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1311465600, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2011"}
