The receiver went \"deaf\" in August and I returned it to Midland for warranty repair.  They sent me a replacment in September, and by November the receiver had failed in the new one.  The radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down.  When the radio would receive signals, the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said.  The transmitter in both units still worked.  Don't waste your money.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poor Quality, Receiver Fails After Six Weeks", "unixReviewTime": 1167177600, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2006"}
