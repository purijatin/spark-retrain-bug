I can use it as a portable CB when I am out of the car or in the vehicle with an external CB antena while on the road.  Weather radio is a big plus as it comes in handy whether camping or in the house and expecting bad weather.  Good example - tornado season.  keep the radio with me when going to the basement for weather updates and if worst case happens, then still have comunication with the outside world.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Midland 75-822 40 channel CB radio", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2013"}
