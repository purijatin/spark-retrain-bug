I bought this to communicate from car to car on a road trip.  It works quite well.  Car to car range is about 1 mile in heavy urban traffic, about 2 miles on the open road (as long as there is no hill between you and the other car).  Converts quickly to a handheld with the supplied battery pack and short rubber antenna.  Range is only about 1/4 to 1/2 mile in this configuration, but could probably be improved with an extendable antenna. I especially appreciate that Midland supplies different battery packs to take either rechargeable or disposable batteries.Only 1 minor gripe.  The belt clip is spring steel and will scratch any belt you hang it on.  I would prefer a plastic squeeze clip like that found on many cell phones, or on industrial walkie talkies.Other than that I'm very satisfied.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good value, works well", "unixReviewTime": 1162512000, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2006"}
