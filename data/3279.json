Midland does, and always has made a good product. This is no different. The handhelds are great if you are in an RV campsite looking for others, or on the road, searching for traffic info.Face it, the 1970's are gone - and even then, power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of 'otherwise friendly' local chats. In the area I'm working near Canada, I get really tired of 2000-watt skip talking power hounds out of Orlando Florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in LA, that you can't hear your neighbor a mile away. Face it, we aren't buying bad radios, we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys.Don't think badly of the Midland 75HH. It is a good little 4-watt radio. It's output with a 'Lil Wil' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a Cobra 29LTD with a suitable tuned antenna. Get your SWR 1.1:1 or so on 20, get 1 and 40 as close as you can, and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles. On a good day, you can get 3-5 miles...and that's all they are really designed for.  Don't forget, the more sunspots, the further you can reach...and sunspots are starting to pick up now...Good radio...I gave it 4-stars, because they've never offered this handheld with a mated external magnet-mount antenna...maybe I expect too much...(but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount, and add an antenna, for the same price).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Handheld CB, not a Galaxy, but will work", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}
