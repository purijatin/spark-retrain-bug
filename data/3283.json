I really don't use CBs for anything more -- like long-distance chatter with truckers and whatnot. It's got some cool features, but honestly, I haven't used them. Either way, this thing is good for what I use it for. Plus, when camping, we can go mobile with it. 10-4 good buddy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Trail Runs in the Jeep", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
