You're not going to blow anyone's doors off or get 20 miles with it but, it works. Its not really loud turned all the way up and if you live in an area where cell phone use while drivin is prohibited, this may cause issues with cops as it looks like your texting on a cell phone...(?) I dont how thats going to go over. Basically just tune the channel and squelching it is real easy with the knob on top, the other knob is volume. Fits nice in the hand and easy to use. I've never had to mess with all those other buttons.But anyway, I keep this in my truck to hand to someone else to use on the fly (with rubber duck antenna) so I can communicate with them. I have a peaked and tweaked cobra unit installed in my truck so no matter what this thing is doin I can get to them and pull them in and hear them should we get distanced on the road.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works", "unixReviewTime": 1372809600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2013"}
