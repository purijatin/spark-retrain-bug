There were 5 star and 1 star reviews. After several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a 2,000 mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again. Both transmission and reception distances are shameful. Even when using No ground plane antennas. Straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about 300 feet. We also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in CB. His Trans and Rec was great but ours was terrible. The unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for 2 miles. 2' is more like it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE", "unixReviewTime": 1313366400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2011"}
