I'm particularly pleased with the three modes of power; AA batteries, NiMH rechargeables, or 12v vehicle. The mobile vehicle adapter includes both a plug-in cigarette lighter power point and a coax connector for an external antenna. I use the Midland 18-2442 magnetic mount (it will tune to SWR of about 1.5 on channels 1 and 40) to significantly increase the range to several miles, depending on conditions. As a mobile radio, it works pretty well given that it's a one (small) size fits all type of unit. But what I really got this for was to use it as a handheld walkie-talkie. And that's where it truly shines. The provided rubber duckie antenna is nice and short, but it severely limits your transmit range. Use it if you don't need to talk more than a couple hundred yards. I mounted the Cobra HA TA telescoping whip antenna and got a tremendous increase in performance. Battery life is pretty good. The rechargeables will last all day with reasonable usage. Plug it into the charger overnight and you're ready for the next day. The weather alert is a nice feature, too.All in all, a very useful small radio that really comes to life when connected to a decent antenna. Recommended for those who need a versatile CB for automobile and handheld applications.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Compact and adaptable", "unixReviewTime": 1332028800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2012"}
