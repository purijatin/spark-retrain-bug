Hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash.  Easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a CB", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great small unit", "unixReviewTime": 1390867200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2014"}
