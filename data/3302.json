Makes it possible to install discretely without tearing up your dash.  And I love having the weather band.My only gripe is that there is not a black cap to put over the silver portable antenna outlet for a cleaner look when it's mounted in a vehicle.  I have tried to find something to put over it and I keep striking out.  Maybe somebody can suggest something?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Needs cap for removable antenna", "unixReviewTime": 1392940800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2014"}
