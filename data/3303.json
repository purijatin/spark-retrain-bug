It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle.  Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb.  After going through that it didn't work.  I am sending it back and will not be reordering.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Defective from the box", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}
