Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby, but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price it's hard to beat.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1355356800, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2012"}
