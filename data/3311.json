FAIL!!I know you can save money buying refurb, but in this case my refurbed radio was missing the key part: the mobile assembly adapter (i.e. car power/antenna adapter). So, while I could use it at home, it was worthless in the car!I will update my review after I receive the NEW one I just ordered. My suggestion if you buy this (and the product is well regarded):BUY NEW...AND ONLY NEW...IF YOU IGNORE THIS WARNING, BE SURE YOU CHECK FOR ALL THE PARTS AND RETURN IF YOU DON'T GET THEM. I read about so many people that say, \"Well, it was missing so and so, but I just kept it anyway.\" NO!Just my 2 cents.BUY NEW!!Update July 2012: I did return the original used radio and bought new. This is a really nice product and I have revised my review to 5 stars.I got this for backup communications in the event cell towers go down (natural or man-made disasters) and I fully believe it will serve wonderfully in that capacity. Just be sure to practice a bit with it and become proficient before you really need it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Radio fine...but...missing critical part!
