I park on the street. When I park at night all I do is slide it out of the holder and take with me just like my radio face plate. Volume output is barely adequate. I like how the acc plug and exterior ant are integrated into one piece. Makes it easy to talk feel like you have mike on regular cb. I like the buttons for Dual watch and scan which are easy to press by feel when driving. It will beep when sw is made. The receive seems to be good and TX is good. You cant do much with 3.5 watt output!! So much for freedom of choice!! Uncle Sam wont let me up the power. ;) Everyone is abiding by that rule:)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good all in one radio", "unixReviewTime": 1304640000, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2011"}
