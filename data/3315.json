Battery life is super like other reviews have said. Have to have a cobra adapter to use the magnetic roof mount. The unit does just as well (with roof mount) as my old unit that has the tradition attached mike, and I can take it out easy when parked. I don't talk much, just listen-(the unit is hard to bring up and face to talk because of all the wires attached...)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great unit", "unixReviewTime": 1356739200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012"}
