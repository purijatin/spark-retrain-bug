The first one was late and determined lost in shipping. Amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery.It worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug. The plug didn't seem to fit completely into the transceiver, so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post.That unit has the exact same issue. It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose. I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA, cost $38, to make sure it wasn't the batteries. It wasn't.This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well, but no CB channels get any reception.Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker, I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug. If that doesn't work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "2 Units and both have defects", "unixReviewTime": 1359590400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2013"}
