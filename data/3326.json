Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that.  On a positive note, it was very simple to install.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't bother", "unixReviewTime": 1300233600, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2011"}
