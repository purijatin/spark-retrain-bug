McManis \"Chuck McManis\"", "helpful": [40, 40], "reviewtext": "The biggest thing about this telescope is its size, not how big it is but how SMALL it is. Small means easy to carry, and that means you'll be more motivated to take it out and look at things. More importantly you will take it to good 'dark sky' locations. Even with the Meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand, that and a simple set up make it fun to use. The Super Plossil Zoom eyepiece is a great accessory, and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best all-around scope", "unixReviewTime": 970704000, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2000"}
