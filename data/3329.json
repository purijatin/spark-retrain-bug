My childhood was peppered with dime-store telescopes that showed me a new blurry world.  When I got the EXT-90EC I expected little more than a brighter blur.  To my surprise and  delight I was wrong.  Out of the box, in bad lighting conditions,  surrounded by trees, I saw some of the most breath-taking images of the  moon.  In fact, I spent the next six hours observing the moon.  I saw  craters in detail.  I even saw some craters within craters.  I did venture  to a bright star I saw in the sky.  It turned out to be Jupiter.  It was a  highly recognizable Jupiter.  Not another dot in the sky.  I could see  three of Jupiter's moons in orbit.  I couldn't even make out Jupiter's  moons with the naked eye.I tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised!  The local  river area came alive with wildlife.  The photographic possibilities are  endless!I purchased the #883 Deluxe field tripod, #932 45 Degree  Erecting Prism, #497 Autostar controller, and the #774 hard case with the  telescope.  I highly recommend you do the same.  They all add to the total  experience.  The tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial  viewing.  The 45 Degree Erecting Prism is needed for terrestrial viewing.  If you don't use it, your images will be inverted.  The autostar, once  aligned, will position the telescope to any viewable object, and then  continue to track it.  The case is a convenience and insurance policy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beyond my wildest expectations!", "unixReviewTime": 943660800, "reviewTime": "11 27, 1999"}
