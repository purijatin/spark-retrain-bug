Be forewarned...you can pay for some books and they will download but you can't open them.  How to avoid this? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook..and not nook color or nook etc...just Nook.  I've had to ask for credits several times already.There aren't enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing. Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet?", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Nook Reader", "unixReviewTime": 1304985600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2011"}
