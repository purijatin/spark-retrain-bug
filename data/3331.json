But it has worked out great.It was a thrill to see Saturns rings and view Jupiter.  The moon comes through bright and clear.  You can see other heavenly objects (even galaxies!) with it.  You won't see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books - but you'll see the dim shading of them in parts of the sky.It's compact and portable - so you can bring it to the beach, etc.  Our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much night-sky viewing - so portability was a must.A scope that gave a better view, at the same price, would have been too big.  And a better portable would have cost too much.  This one was just right for us.  If price is not a problem, get a better portable scope.  If size is not a constraint, then spend less on a larger scope.  Otherwise, this one will do fine.MUST HAVE ADD ONS: A tripod (see my review there).  The computer controller (you'll NEVER find a lot of the night sky objects without one).  One or two good night sky books (to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxies).COMPLAINTS: It would be nice for this (and all scopes) to see some pictures of how night-sky objects will really look with it before buying.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Amateur Scope!", "unixReviewTime": 1039651200, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2002"}
