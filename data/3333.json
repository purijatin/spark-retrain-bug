Well, he lied and this Mead Telescope was broken, it do not turn left or right, something with the the gears inside of it (I can hear noise of the engines). After research I realized that I can't fix it because it's made very flimsy, so it's unrepairable. Mead customers support sad that they don't have parts for it because it's discontinued and will not repair it (not speaking that it would be costly repair if they had parts).$400 wasted. Don't buy used.If somebody need telescope with broken U-base and tripod, let me know.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "I bought it and it was broken", "unixReviewTime": 1370908800, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2013"}
