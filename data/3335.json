My favorite feature is its &quot;give me a tour of what's good tonight.&quot; It is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its &quot;identify this&quot; feature. The only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work. The instructions weren't that clear between the scope, the tripod, and the Astrostar book. My recommendations to you, remember to align the scope to true north (i hold a compass on the lens tube), use a bubble level to level the tube, set your watch to the second on the nights you go out, and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned. Do these four things and I guarantee you'll have a great night of viewing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Find stars you never knew existed", "unixReviewTime": 971654400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2000"}
