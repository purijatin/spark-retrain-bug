Schuffert", "helpful": [62, 65], "reviewtext": "This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX-90EC.  After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off, the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at. It took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller.  I had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope.  Once I learned the reference stars, the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby.  I cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controller!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Must have for ETX-90EC", "unixReviewTime": 945561600, "reviewTime": "12 19, 1999"}
