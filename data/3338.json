We're novices with the telescope, so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challenge.With the autostart, after taking about 15 minutes to go through the alignment process, we can just tell the Autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us.  Without this, the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moon.NOTE: If you're not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky (i.e. planets, etc), then you don't need the Autostar.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Optional for Beginners", "unixReviewTime": 1037232000, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2002"}
