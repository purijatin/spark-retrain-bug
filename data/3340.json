It wouldn't stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters.  It will stop the casual impulsive thief who walks by in the library.Anyway, as this particular product goes it is well manufactured and works smoothly.  I use it in the law library (where you know and trust most everyone) if I have to be up and down a lot, like when I'm doing research throughout the library.  It provides a little peace of mind in such situations.Thanks for reading", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It does what it should", "unixReviewTime": 1067385600, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2003"}
