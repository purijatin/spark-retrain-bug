I'm headed to help coordinate a conference TOMORROW, so I ordered this lock to protect my laptop. I didn't want a combination lock because I've had those get all mixed up & unusable (thankfully not while connected to my laptop!)Sadly, this lock does not fit the new MBPro. I can't even get the lock into the Kensington slot, PLUS the metal stubs scraped up the surrounding area on my brand new comp! The scrapes aren't a *huge* deal, but I'm sad, given I've only had the comp a couple weeks.Now I'm headed off to Target in hopes of finding something. I'm just sad about the ridiculous price I'm gonna have to pay. If there's something I'm missing, I'd love to hear about it!Here's the UPDATE:After I had no success finding a lock at Target (Best Buy was closed), I came home & worked the lock some more. I finally got it to work, but I'm not sure what I did any differently: I lined up the Tbar with the stubs, put it in the slot, & turned the key to the left. I just hope it doesn't act fussy when I get where I'm going.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not for New MBPros (2012) - CORRECTION: OK", "unixReviewTime": 1358208000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2013"}
