I looked all over the place and aside from the plumbing under the sinks -- which didn't seem like a good idea -- the only place I could loop it to was the bedframe. This is in no way critical of the device; just you might want to consider what you're going to attach it to.The only flaw was a bit of a burr in the cable sticking through the plastic coating, which I filed down. You might want to inspect it when you take it out of the box so you don't get surprised and bleed all over the place.The cable is of course vulnerable if a thief has a substantial pair of cutters; I lost a bicycle locked with the same kind of cable many years back. But this seems like a good-enough product, considering that limitation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Looped to bedframe", "unixReviewTime": 1238457600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2009"}
