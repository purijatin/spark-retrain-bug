It's a 17&#34; MacBook Pro, so it's not small enough for a hotel safe, and I hate leaving it out when I leave the room because I just don't want to tempt housekeeping in that way. Packing it back up to keep it hidden every time I go out has gotten too tiresome, though, so I finally looked around and purchased this security cable.I'm so glad I did.This was a fine fit for my laptop model &#8212;the slot for it is on the right. I wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg, so that if anyone decided to take the laptop, they'd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves. I'm aware that anyone really determined to take it still could, but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place, it's really not worth it to the casual snatcher, and that's enough for my peace of mind; it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table, ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Peace of mind while traveling", "unixReviewTime": 1369526400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2013"}
