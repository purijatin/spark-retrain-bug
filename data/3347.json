But a moment ago when I picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it, I sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced (God knows what had happened to it) and I could not fit my key in. OK they said they would have a life-time warranty but I hate such kind of trouble. I guess they could provide better product with such a price. Any way since it is a touch lock (I like the design very much) I could still give them 2 stars, but not more.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Looks nice and safe - but broke in two weeks!", "unixReviewTime": 1029628800, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2002"}
