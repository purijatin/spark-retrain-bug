More good ones then bad ones so I decided to check this lock out for myself.Well, ya got this heavy cable, that yes, you can cut thru if you have cutters on hand, which people that are out to steal your unit have on hand, ya got this lock that they say is tamper proof, so someone messes with it and now you can't even unlock it tell you get help, so you have to leave it cause you got to be somewhere like class or work, and now your not in a very good mood.Now that I have one of these I am a bit confused.  Everybody is talking about the cable and the lock and I saw where nobody mentioned the fact that this whole thing is tied to this little T shaped piece of steel that is stuck in this thin piece of either aluminum or plastic and all you have to do is grap it, pull up or down on the lock and it pulls right out with little effort.  Sure, laptop is a little damaged, but the guy who just stole yours doesn't care one bit.As I said in another review, how do I know this, well, I stuck it in my ProBook 4730s which is the thin aluminum type on the side and when I picked it up wrong and grapped it by the lock, the weight of the laptop alone was enough to pull this thing right out, and all I had to do is tap the side of the laptop a bit to bend it back and you really can't even tell it was damaged.If you want to protect your unit, don't walk away from it, and as for this lock idea, it looks good to those that are not out to steal yours, but a joke to those that are.This lock design will slow down a theif about 5 seconds at the most, so if your 6 seconds away from yours, it's gone.PS>this is the only bad review I have written, so keep that in mind if you decide to check this lock thing out with buying one.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Looks good, but not.", "unixReviewTime": 1326499200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2012"}
