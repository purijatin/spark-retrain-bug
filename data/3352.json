While the laptop is worth like 100.00, it does contain information and programs that are priceless to me.  I am moving overseas and this cable is exactly what I was looking for.The \"T-bar\" fits perfectly into apple's port and is very easy to take off.  I know that some other reviewers were having problems with their newer macbooks so I was a bit concerned.  If you have a \"vintage\" ibook/powerbook/G4 this should serve you well.Remember that this is NOT a heavy duty Chain.  If someone has access to your locked laptop for more than 15 minutes, I can think of a handful of ways to break the cable.  On hindsight, if you leave this attached to a desk while you use the bathroom, I would highly doubt that someone could break this within several minutes.  Although anything is possible...  It is still better than nothing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Definitely worth 32.00", "unixReviewTime": 1232064000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2009"}
