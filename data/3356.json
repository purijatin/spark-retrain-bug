It's a little difficult to lock because of the way it was constructed. Other then the difficulty locking it, the cable is awesome. It's very strong and bends easily so it can be anchored to something. I was very pleased with this lock and it does everything I needed/wanted it to do. I would definitely recommend this to a family member or a friend to use as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty Strong but pretty confusing too", "unixReviewTime": 1280966400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2010"}
