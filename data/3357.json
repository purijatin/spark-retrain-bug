Get up and leave your  laptop for a few minutes, this lock makes a good deterrent from the casual, opportunity-driven thief. No, it won't prevent someone vandalizing your laptop. No, it won't stop a thief with a good cable cutter. So if you see anyone at the cafe or library with a cable cutter, think twice. Oh, you would anyway? I thought so. Some reviewers here must think you have no common sense.  So let's assume you do. You're considering this one because it's a very AFFORDABLE deterrent. Another Kensington with an alarm may appeal to you if you want wander a few feet out of sight of your laptop, and want an audible alarm if someone tries to yank it off -- but then, who in their right mind will try to defeat a laptop with an alarm in a library? It's all a matter of risk assessment. If you think you may be leaving your laptop in a place where passersby possess industrial-grade cable cutters or the knowledge to defeat alarms, then perhaps you don't want to leave our laptop at all.So this affordable little cable is a suitable deterrent where you feel it's appropriate for the risk. A relatively benign public location ... your place of work where your laptop isn't accessible to anyone but employees and staff ...  a hotel, where only the staff have access to your room. These are places where the risk of theft is minimized, and this easy-to-use cable lock is probably quite appropriate.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice deterrant, for the price, but don't expect this to do more", "unixReviewTime": 1136073600, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2006"}
