If the lock is tampered with the lock goes into \"lockdown\" mode, and the owner's key will not be able to open the lock.Here's what I was told by Kensington tech support:If anyone tries to open the lock without the proper key, using an alternate key or a pin, etc., the lock will go into \"lockdown\" mode. The company claims you need to hire a locksmith to open a lock once it's in lockdown mode, and they will reimburse you up to $80 of your expenses.This sounds insane to me. The lock should be hard for a thief to open. But I want to be able to open my own lock without professional assistance, even if someone tried to tamper with it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Tamper-Evident \"feature\"", "unixReviewTime": 1245801600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2009"}
