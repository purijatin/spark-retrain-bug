I have used them for several years in many environments, and they work very well.Why I like it:  Robust cable that is long enough to secure your item in most locations, reliable lock, Kensington warranty.Summary:  This was a very good deal for the lock itself, which is why I bought 2--my customers are always looking for something like this.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the seller's shipping fees were pretty high.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handy security device at a decent price", "unixReviewTime": 1378252800, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2013"}
