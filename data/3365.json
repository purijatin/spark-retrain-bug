Since the combination lock versions seem to be incredibly unreliable, I decided to give this one a try, it being a reasonably priced lock.  I haven't had any problems with it so far, using it everyday for about 2 weeks while at work.  It is very easy to use. The only thing you have to make sure is that the main flat part that goes into the slot lines up with the prongs that are on either side. Its sort of hard to explain but once you have it in your hand you will see what I mean.  Once the prongs and flat part are aligned, the lock fits easily into the security slot.  Just give it one good quarter of a turn, and your mac/pc is safe.  I experienced no warping of my MacBook casing, in fact there is a little rubber part that separates the metal lock that the key goes in from your mac, preventing any sort of scratching. Overall a good lock at a reasonable price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works fine on my MacBook", "unixReviewTime": 1268956800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2010"}
