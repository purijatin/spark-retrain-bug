Although it does not make your computer equal to Fort Knox, it will at the very least slow a would-be theif down. I can hang my 8lb laptop off of it, and bounce it up and down  with the cable, and it holds firm (trial conducted over my bed, a heavily  padded surface). I like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to  avoid the cable kinking, and becoming cumbersome. I also like the fact that  it is a key operated system. Although combinations are quicker, they can be  hacked in about 5 minutes of trying, and slipping a key in the lock and  giving a quick turn can't be any simpler. Just remember to keep one key in  a safe place, and write the key serial number down somewhere so a  replacement can be found. For the money, I don't think there is a better  security option for notebook computers, unless you spend the $40 on a  doberman puppy, and train it to attack computer theifs. But that would be  hard. Buy this lock system, and it could save you $3000.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A wise way to spend money for notebook security", "unixReviewTime": 962064000, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2000"}
