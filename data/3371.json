First impressions are good, the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product. The key is big and easy to locate. The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched (not really a concern on *this* laptop).I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device. There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off. Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop. The Kensington slot is right by my system fan, which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air. The metal lock gets very hot. Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves.It's no secret that cable can be cut, the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleased today", "unixReviewTime": 1281571200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2010"}
