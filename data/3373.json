I leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel. These are light, and simple to operate. No complaints. I've used the Kensington brand laptop cables for years - I think since they first came out. I lose them periodically but keep buying more. I highly recommend.As a bonus, it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security \"hole/notch\" so you can secure these with the security cables also. Very nice. My new Seagate 500GB FreeAgent does for sure but I've seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Light, Effective, Laptop Security Solution", "unixReviewTime": 1197590400, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2007"}
