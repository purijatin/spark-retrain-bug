In the instructions, we read about the tamper proof feature. If someone tampers with the lock, you'll see a red line on the lock, and NO key will work. The instructions are to call the 800 number, which I did just to see what the next step we would take. We were told that we would have to call a locksmith, and Kensington would pay up to $80 for the locksmith.So let's say my son is at the college library with his locked computer. He gets up, and someone tampers with it, or maybe some of the kids are just fooling around with it. When he returns, he cannot unlock it from the library table. So now he has to call a locksmith, and wait, possibly missing classes. What if the library is closing, the computer would have to stay there. What if he cannot get a locksmith for a day or so, the locked computer still sits at the library.We bought a combination lock.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tamper proof issue", "unixReviewTime": 1282262400, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2010"}
