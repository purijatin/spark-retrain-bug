I first tried it on my wife's new hp laptop and it worked well. Then I decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame. I quickly removed it from my macbook. Since it didn't stay on my macbook long it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook. It will damage the frame.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does what it says but not good for macbooks", "unixReviewTime": 1217116800, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2008"}
