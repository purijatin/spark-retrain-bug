Locks and unlocks easily, so you don't have to spend five minutes trying to lock, and then another five minutes trying to unlock, your computer. It DOES wiggle around on my netbook, which is why the rubber bumper is really nice, but doesn't wiggle around on my laptop. So whether you get the 'wiggle' people were talking about depends on the computer slot you're dealing with. It is superior in every way, though, to the Kensington combination lock with the coiled cable, which is what I bought before this one. That one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock!! So if you're choosing between a Kensington combination and a Kensington key, go with the key. Your poor computer casing will thank you.Cons: As others have mentioned, it's a little short. Also I'm a bit concerned about the 'if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again!!' feature others have mentioned, but I'll deal with that when it happens, if it does. Key is a little bulky to carry.I use this as part of a multi-tiered security system. Of course a lock alone won't stop someone with a bolt cutter. I'm only hoping to slow down a casual 'snatch and grab' thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or such.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It does exactly what a lock in its price range should do", "unixReviewTime": 1285804800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2010"}
