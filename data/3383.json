I have a 2011 aluminum 15\" MacBook Pro & this lock works well with it. It took a while to get it to work, but after reading reviews I found out that you have to align the little \"T\" on the lock with the 2 poles by inserting the key & then turning it rightwards. Once you have done that you can just insert it into your laptop & give the key a slight turn! The cable also seems like it would be pretty sturdy to discourage the average thief.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works with my 2011 MacBook Pro!", "unixReviewTime": 1313884800, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2011"}
