Tie your laptop up wherever you go, especially the library! I live on the ground floor, and my desk is right next to the window. So I keep my laptop locked up even when it's at home, so that any would-be burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook. Although, if he really wanted to, he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable.All in all, this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and I recommend it for all laptop users.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Makes me feel safe when I leave my laptop unattended.", "unixReviewTime": 1105660800, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2005"}
