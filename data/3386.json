Took a little while to coordinate the latch/holding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer, mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism off-alignment so it will no longer insert properly. But once you've figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to complete.The attached encased steel cable is thick and stout, more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store tie-down security setups, for instance. This should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks. It's not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft, but the would-be thief will now have to have a fairly heavy-duty set of cutters in order to get through this cable. The lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well; the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itself.Solid product at a more than reasonable price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Stout lock", "unixReviewTime": 1288396800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010"}
