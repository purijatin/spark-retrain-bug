As others have said, it won't stop a bolt cutter, and it could probably be picked given enough time. But in an environment like an office or restaurant, it should be fine.The cable is flexible, and nicely coated so that it doesn't scuff surfaces. The lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy, and it hasn't scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses. The only real concern I see: the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks I've used; so if there's some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop, you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works fine; watch out for the size of the lock mechanism", "unixReviewTime": 1257811200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2009"}
