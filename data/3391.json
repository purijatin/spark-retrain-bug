No little plug for the whole is necessary. The part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable. It took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to use the key to attach the lock to the Lap Top but once I figured out how to use it, it is a very quick lock or un-lock. (I could have read the directions but where's the fun in that.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this Lock", "unixReviewTime": 1400371200, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2014"}
