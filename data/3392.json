A friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss. From that moment I decide that I needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet I chose the Kensington 64068F Microsaver Notebook Lock and security cable. Of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room together!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There are locks and there is Kensington Lock", "unixReviewTime": 1222992000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2008"}
