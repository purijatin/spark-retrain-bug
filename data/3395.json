The Chinese who put it together are probably great too.  But the service doesn't exist.  The frame is set back too far from the edge on my new Dell Inspiron.  I don't know - if I was marketing this I would try to find out what PC's it worked on and make a couple drop down lists on the webpage so you could find out, without having to order it, pull it out of the package, see that it doesn't work, try to get it back in the package, buy a roll of tape, pay over half the cost to send it back, and then get know notification that it was received and no notification when it supposedly gets credited back into my account.  When you send it back they have you download two forms.  Each form is the same and contains both forms.  If I wanted to see how angry I could make people, I'd quit my job and go work for them.  I would say that qualifies as non-existent service.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Frames Are Not All The Same", "unixReviewTime": 1377561600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2013"}
