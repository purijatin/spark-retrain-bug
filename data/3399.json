The lock and cable appear to be of good quality. The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models. It was listed and purchased as a used item, but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones. How much abuse can a lock like this take? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Amazon. If there is ever a problem, it is accepted back immediately.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Kensington Key Lock", "unixReviewTime": 1337990400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2012"}
