It doesn't feel too stable there.  They would have damaged good however.  This prevents my notebook from being walked away with when I am at the library.  Its worth paying $30 to protect a $2000 toy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Will do but not theft proof", "unixReviewTime": 975974400, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2000"}
