Bromley", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I purchased the Kensington 64068F computer cable and lock because I was familiar with the Kensington Brand. I have been very disappointed with this product, and its use with my HP Pavilion dv6 laptop. The manner in which the key fit into the lock has always been a problem; it has always been difficult to fit in and turn to lock it. I have used it about twenty-five times until an internal part broke off rendering it inoperable. This means a product failure in less than a month. I am concluding that the design of the locking mechanism is faulty. It was not a good buy.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poorly designed", "unixReviewTime": 1388102400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013"}
