I say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it. However this is the case with any cable-lock.Non the less, the cable itself is thick and high quality.  The thicker design makes it both look and feel sturdier as well as more deterring to a thief than some other, thinner cables I've seen.  Its black plastic coating helps to make it more aesthetically pleasing and keep the metal from rubbing against my wooden desk.  Like many other cables this one uses a loop design as the anchor.While the thicker design is great for strength it lacks flexibility (the only downfall of the entire product).  While this cable is capable of making sharp turns, it takes a lot of effort.  If you have a sharp bend near the lock it could put a lot of torque on your computer.The actual lock is free to rotate to keep the cable from twisting.  The lock uses a barrel key and comes with two copies, allowing me to keep one on my key chain and a spare in my safe (additional keys can be order through Kensington using the ID number on the side of the keys, should you need them).  When deciding between cables, I decided on one with a key because I travel around a lot and wanted to be able to quickly lock and unlock my computer.Overall, this is a great product.  I currently only need one but should the need arise, I would certainly a second!Pros:- Thick cable- Long cable- Aesthetically pleasing- Two keysCons:- Not very flexible", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple to use laptop securty", "unixReviewTime": 1359417600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2013"}
