I have used trackballs before to a limited extent, and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow, but I wanted something that would better match my Mac.  Well, forget about that. The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use...I had cleaned it several times in the first week, and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned.  I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place. After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON.  It is pretty, it SHOULD work better, but after thinking it over I ditched \"matching\", went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse. It is a great fit for my hand, and now resides on my desk.  The marble mouse is cheaper too, which is odd.  If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON. Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go, which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal, unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sad to say this just won't do the job", "unixReviewTime": 1111363200, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2005"}
