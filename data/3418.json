Don't let this trackball sour you from the concept. Trackballs themselves are MUCH better and MUCH easier on your hands, wrists, and arms then regular mice, but this one is a real stinker.First off, it's FAR too heavy. The ball is mechanical, NOT optical, so it makes for slow, plodding, difficult motions. It's a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingers.Secondly, it's just not as comfortable as other, similar designed trackballs like the MUCH easier and OPTICAL Marble Mouse by Logitech. This one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart. There wasn't any natural &quot;drapping&quot; of the hand on this design.Thirdly, it's WAY overpriced. For ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effort.For those who like this style, I highly recommend you opt for the Logitech Marble Mouse. At about $20, it's a much better value. I used one for about five years and noticed a GREAT reduction in wrist pain.For those wanting more options (such as scroll wheels and such), I would suggest the very well designed Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman. It's what I upgraded to after using the Marble Mouse for so many years. It does require a slight change in position of hand, but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable thumb-wheel designs you see; you still use your fingers to roll the main ball around.Do yourself a favor and get a trackball. Just make sure it's an optical one instead of a mechanical one. You'll really be thankful you did and you'll notice improvement and relief from wrist/hand/arm pain.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Trackballs are great - this one, however, is NOT", "unixReviewTime": 1067990400, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2003"}
