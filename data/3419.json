They are built well and have superior drivers. The Orbit is a great entry level trackball I got for my son's Mac Mini. I use Expert Mice on my three Macs (1 home, 2 at work). The orbit gets 4 stars only because the Kensington Expert mouse is so much better.Add in a no questions asked 5 year warranty and you have no worries.My only complaint about Kensington? no bluetooth yet.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Kensington is quality", "unixReviewTime": 1127606400, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2005"}
