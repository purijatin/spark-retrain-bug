You are also not able to have the TV viewer on while playing games with either PCI or AGP video card.  If a scheduled show brings up the TV while you are playing a game, the game, ATI player (most common), both, or the whole computer will crash!This doesn't get a 1 rating, because of the great software features.  Still and motion video capture is awesome.  The scheduler is great, though useless to gamers with this particlular card (see above).  ATI TV cards are better than the other TV cards out there when it comes to the features.  It is better than microsoft webtv too built into windows 98 also.Just get ATI-TV with the AMC ribbon cable connector if you have an older computer (ATI Pro Turbo, Expression, RageII+ or older video card), or the new ATI All-In Wonder (Radeon is newest) if you have a newer one.  Just don't get this card (ATI-TV-Wonder) or any other PCI bus TV Card.If you have a non-ATI video card, then you are stuck with this card, as it is compatible with non-ATI cards, but ATI-TV and the All-InWonder require ATI Graphics.  But in any case, there is no integrated solution for gaming as of yet (ATI video cards are not good enough for serious 3D gaming) unless you can get a multi-video card system running.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Never buy a PCI TV Card!  ATI TV cards are great though.", "unixReviewTime": 973555200, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2000"}
