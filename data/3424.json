It has met all my needs in a TV Tuner card to go in the PCI slot of my low-end emachine.My emachine did come with a ATI video card, so I think that  made it really easy. It also accepts composite input, something I haven't  tried yet.Had a minor audio issue with this product. Called support, got  a stupid person once, helpful person the next time I called.Overall good  product, I assume the regular more expensive product is even better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good product", "unixReviewTime": 962236800, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2000"}
