Head \"iransofaraway\"", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "This card may be fine for just watching TV on your PC, but for video capturing, the quality is horrible. You cannot capture above 240 pixels height-wise, and this severely limits the card in my opinion. I was expecting 480x480 capture ability (Which is present in their much much older product, the ATi All-In-Wonder.. over 4 years old!), but did not find any. Add on to that the fact that the MPEG1/MPEG2 encoding is done through software (not hardware), and horribly at that.. the card just isn't worth the price tag.Perhaps the only good part about this product was that the install went smoothly. Well, kind of. The package doesn't contain software for Windows 2000. You have to go to ATi's website and download beta software/drivers. It takes about 3 reboots to get the card installed completely in Windows 2000. No biggie.If you want a decent capture card, either get an ATi All-In-Wonder Radeon, or wait for nVidia's new &quot;Personal Cinema&quot; to come out (supports everything the AIW does, plus it has a remote, and you can view both TV/VGA at the same time!) I think I'll just save up my money and get a Sony DV &lt;-&gt; Analog converter box. Now that's quality.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Ugh-- Just wait for nVidia Personal Cinema", "unixReviewTime": 999043200, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2001"}
