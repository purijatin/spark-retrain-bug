They are not the loudest out there but it's amazing that they are as loud as they are considering the satelites fit in the palm of your hand.My only complaint is that Yamaha was offering a rebate when I bought these speakers and I sent in all  the nessecary stuff, reciept, rebate form and the UPC from the box. Then I  got a postcard from Yamaha saying that they needed the UPC. And since I  sent them the original I was out of luck.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good speakers - Bad service (Yamaha)", "unixReviewTime": 962928000, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2000"}
