I read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to use my gift certificates (courtesy of echo.com) towards these speakers.  I admit, when I pulled them out of the box they looked awfully weenie. After pluggin' them in and firing up good old winamp, their quality blew me away. The human voice sounds so convincing through the 2 inch satellite speakers, and the subwoofer compliments them perfectly. Unlike other systems I've heard, the sub &quot;knows&quot; when NOT to broadcast- the resulting response is amazing.My only qualms about ordering this system is that its packing weight- 18 lbs- carries a corresponding shipping cost of a little over 8 bucks. Well worth it but something to consider when figuring the final cost. ... .I'd recommend this system to anybody! Check it out!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rich sounds from an affordable system", "unixReviewTime": 972864000, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2000"}
