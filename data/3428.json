The sound quality is good (don't expect hi-fi quality sound, of course).  The sub-woofer is sounds great, too.  At the back it can accept 2 line input, so I can connect my 2 PC to the same box w/o problem.  Generally, it is a very good computer speaker.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great set of speaker at great price", "unixReviewTime": 994723200, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2001"}
