For my purposes (watching DVD's, listening to MP3's, and general fooling around), they are perfect. The price is simply unreal for the quality these speakers  have.Look elsewhere for speakers to replace your stereo, however. These  are THIRTY WATT speakers. You arent going to find punchy bass for the likes  of hip-hop, rap, and other bass-heavy music.These speakers provide rich,  clear sound at normal to loudish levels (fills my house!).I would give  them a 4.5 out of five stars, but I wasnt able to. I wholly recommend these  to anyone who is looking for speakers for their computer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great *Computer* Speakers", "unixReviewTime": 959904000, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2000"}
