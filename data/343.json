I bought it over a Kindle because of issues I researched about Amazons' proprietary ebook formats and to get library books or other epubs you had to do some conversion to get them to work on the Kindle.  I wanted the easiest thing for my wife to deal with and the Nook is great - had a couple ebooks (from Borders.com and Barnes and Noble) downloaded and library books the first night!  Just need a free download to manage the books from Adobe and your set.  Its easy to navigate, batteries last about a month and my wife uses it every day.  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome - Best E-reader!", "unixReviewTime": 1300924800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2011"}
