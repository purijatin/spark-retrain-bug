That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice unit.....but be extremely careful...", "unixReviewTime": 1263513600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2010"}
