The headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control.  If you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side, you can adjust the pitch for normal playback.The entire AD500 is under twelve pounds.As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book \"Take Me To A Circus Tent\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice combination of the two!", "unixReviewTime": 1183507200, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2007"}
