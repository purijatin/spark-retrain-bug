I like the auto repeat function.  The size and price and combo unit had great appeal.  Never used the remote, so don't know.  Easy to \"install\" and use right away - no complex hookup needed.  I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Met our needs well", "unixReviewTime": 1193702400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2007"}
