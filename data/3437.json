Although you may be tempted to use high speed dubbing, take the extra time and record in the normal mode.  Very few decks (Especially in the price range of 100.00) were able to offer trouble free high-speed dubbing.The old saying you get what you pay for is realistic.  The construction is not made for heavy use on a daily basis and you need to operate the controls with care and not reckless abandon.If you take it easy on the controls and use but don't abuse, for the price you will be satisfied.As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book \"Take Me To A Circus Tent\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good unit at a fair price but please be kind to it", "unixReviewTime": 1183507200, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2007"}
