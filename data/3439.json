One of the cassette mechanisms on this particular TEAC W-600R developed a loud electronic hum (which had also translated to the Recording as well as the Playback mode) after only 3 weeks of extremely light use - a virtual out-of-box failure. I returned the item for a replacement (ever the Optimist or simply too stupid to know better) and am awaiting the new unit. I must add that, unfortunately, my experience with TEAC products has always been disappointing at best (at present, I have 3 TEAC products and all suffer from a malfunction of some sort on at least one of the features). I actually purchased this W-600R to \"replace\" (via AUX) the suddenly non-functioning cassete decks on my TEAC DC-D2831 Compact Hi-Fi System (rather than trash the whole System). Those just quit out-of-the-blue. These failures seem to happen too regularly to attribute to a series of coincidences. Just saying \"beware\", I suppose. Sometimes a bargain isn't always a bargain.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "TEAC - a favourable price but at what cost?", "unixReviewTime": 1169078400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2007"}
