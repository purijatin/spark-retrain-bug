I've watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and I guess the camera angles made it look wider. It's so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket (Like pajama pockets). I already have 12 books and I actually finished one just now I started reading it at 1:30pm and it's 11:45pm I say not bad the book was 155 pages too. Once I got the hang of it I was very pleased with my purchase and I recommend probably just getting the Nook Simple Touch but coming down to reading it doesn't matter just read people! That's a little rant. So I'll maybe give another in depth review of this in a week. See you soon, thanks for reading my review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Needed to get acquainted with at first.", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012"}
