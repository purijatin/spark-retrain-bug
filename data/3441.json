What a dissapointment. It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged. It didn't have a earphone jack--my fault, I should have looked closer. After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor quality cassette player", "unixReviewTime": 1268611200, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2010"}
