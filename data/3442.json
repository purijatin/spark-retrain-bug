The standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playing---no hiss or hum from the motors (I mean if you put your ear up to the component itself---not the lack of noise on the audio outputs, which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player).  The error-correction algorithms are excellent---I played some badly scratched CDs that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points.  I would give it five stars but for two things--- (1) occasional speaker pop on power-up (easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power amp/receiver on last when powering up your system), and (2) limited programming/playback options---there doesn't seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single CD straight through (without creating a program containing all the tracks of that CD).  The internal DAC is not bad, and of course the optical output lets you hook up your DAC of choice.  Bottom line, this is a GREAT bargain in Red Book changers, well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model (what is JVC thinking?).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you find one of these, snap it up!", "unixReviewTime": 1240704000, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2009"}
