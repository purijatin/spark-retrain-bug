I really like this JVC changer. It replaces a three or four year old fairly high end Sony changer that started skipping the first 10 seconds of every disc. The changer is connected to a Yamaha RXV-2600 receiver via a fiber optic connector (the same path as the Sony changer). I was very surprised at how much better CD's sound on this player. I'm totaly sold. My guess, you can spend a lot more money, and not be any happier.One downside to this changer, it is tall. But I'll take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap sounding.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great CD Changer", "unixReviewTime": 1198800000, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2007"}
