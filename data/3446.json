Well it seems as though I can and this JVC machine has the best specs in it's price range.  I listen to everything from Rock to Classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none.  There are more \"advanced\" CD changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they don't come close to the sound of this CD changer.I guess I am bad talking about the features of this machine.  So I will leave that up to somebody else.  I will say that you can load three CDs at one time which is more than most CD changers.  I just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproduction.EDIT:  Right now I am a man with two stereos.  I know that I should be so lucky.  This JVC is with my OLD \"A\" system.  I have owned this model or the 158 just below it a few times before. My last JVC 258 lasted only 9 months before starting to skip uncontrollably.  I have had durability problems with this model even though as I've said it has the best specs in it's class.  When not owning the JVC I've owned a Harmon Kardon which sounded superior, but costed more, and broke after only 3 months.  I've also owned Sony's both the budget, mid, and high-end models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or MP3's.  Currently my \"B\" system has a Yamaha 697 which has great specs, but is more expensive.  I hope the Yamaha will be more durable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You Can't Beat The Specs For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 1217462400, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2008"}
