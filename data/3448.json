Mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities. It closely matches my older (non-JVC) RCVR/AMP unit in size and looks.  It is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money, this is a good deal IMHO.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty Good Base CD Changer", "unixReviewTime": 1186617600, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2007"}
