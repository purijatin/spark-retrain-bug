This player has  excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are  well laid out. The disk exchange feature is nice, you can leave one disk  playing while you swap the others. The only  downside to this player is on  the programming, you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered,  doing so stops the program and you have to start over again. This is mostly  annoying when you are recording to MD or tape and realize that you have  forgotten a song.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent DVD player for the price", "unixReviewTime": 949622400, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2000"}
