I've owned this changer for about 6 months now, and find it more than suitable for casual use.  My previous 5 disc changer was a Kenwood CD-203 (purchased in 1998); I also own a Pioneer 301 disc changer.  Before purchasing this changer, I was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here.  I bit the bullet, as my Kenwood changer was acting up, and I am quite happy with this product.This changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues.  I use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver, and the quality is excellent.  The remote works even with sloppy angles.  The changer is quiet when changing CDs (rotating the carousel), and the display is readable from across the room.There are a few little quirks:  The changer differentiates between 'exchanging' a CD (thus not interrupting the currently playing CD, and not opening the drawer all the way) and 'open', which stops the current CD and opens the drawer.  Personally, I find the distinction a little annoying, since I almost always want to 'exchange'.  My previous Kenwood has no such distinction.I also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sight--I like to listen to music in low light or even darkness, so I had to memorize some of the remote buttons (In particular, 'disc skip' is located in the middle of the remote).However, these are extremely minor nits.  The changer is excellent, feels sturdy, and has survived about 600 hours of use in the last 6 months.  I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nothing wrong with this at all", "unixReviewTime": 1139184000, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2006"}
