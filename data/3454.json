Roberts", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I have had this changer for approximately 5 weeks, past the Amazon 30 day return policy, unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me.  JVC will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer.At first, there were seldom, random skips, garbles, and lyric repeats.  These have become more frequent and annoying.  Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help.  My ten year old Yamaha changer, it has drawer problems, plays my discs flawlessly.So far, this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse.  Everything else is working and I do like the unit.  The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or, like with cars, the repair people cannot duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time, energy, or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt.  Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player?I am disappointed, to say the least, and from my experience, I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble.  I hope your purchase goes better.Update: 1/21/09I took the unit in for warranty repair.  They replaced the laser and on the technician's equipment, both analog and optical cable connections were tested, the unit played flawlessly.  On my home system with a new optical cable, I again had the original problems.  I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection.  It must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so I no longer believe it is the unit itself.  I have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together.  I conclude that was my situation.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Gambled and Lost", "unixReviewTime": 1227916800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2008"}
