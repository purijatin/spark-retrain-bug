Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The eReader Experience", "unixReviewTime": 1303603200, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2011"}
