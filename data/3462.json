These dogs run maybe 30 seconds giving a possible 2 supposed cleanings before rewind. The 'cleaning tape' doesn't appear any different than 'video tape' and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined. Went back to using a 20 year old cleaning tape.This product is a DOG DOG DOG and stink you'll stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeks.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "CrappaMundo", "unixReviewTime": 1364515200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013"}
