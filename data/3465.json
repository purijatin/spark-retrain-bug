I bought a couple of Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaners because I planned to copy a lot of old VHS tapes to DVD on my new VCR/DVD recorder.  I've successfully used it about five times total on three VCRs. In the last attempts, when I inserted the cartridge, it immediately started rewinding, and I had to stop it and hit play. It doesn't always play. This has happened on two VCRs. So...the jury's still out on this product.  I think I'm supposed to get about 100 uses.  I'll come back and edit my review if I have any new information.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too Early For a Review, Amazon", "unixReviewTime": 1252972800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2009"}
