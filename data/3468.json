Generally, if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems. In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads. Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play pre-recorded budget tapes in your VCR. You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture, sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads, linear audio heads, rollers and guides. In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me, but I have found that this Maxell Dry Head Cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely. This Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.I have found that for best performance, it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your VHS player/recorder. This allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem. I have not had to use a wet cleaner in over 14 years now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Dry Head Cleaner", "unixReviewTime": 1379721600, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2013"}
