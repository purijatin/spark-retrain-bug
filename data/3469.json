This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format.  I liked the original product much, much better - not happy. Try to find Maxell SKU: 290058, UPC: 025215290053, to see if it does the job.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Head cleaner for VHS player-recorders.", "unixReviewTime": 1348444800, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2012"}
