I read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case.  There appears to be very poor quality control on these and buyer beware.  The product I received destroyed the picture and I am hoping another product will be able to fix the VCR.Addendum: Another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripe.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Defective", "unixReviewTime": 1338595200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2012"}
