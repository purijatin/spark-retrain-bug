It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture. I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I don't know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Did Not Clean Adequately", "unixReviewTime": 1249689600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2009"}
