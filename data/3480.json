I have several VHS players, and this is a must for me.  Very easy to use to get great results without having to open up the VHS unit to clean it, though I still do once in a while just to visually check the bands.  This works as good as the wet type head cleaner, but without the hassle of adding drops into the head cleaner tape.  I recommend this head cleaner.  I give this a 5 star rating because this is the simpliest way to clean the video and audio heads of a VHS.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A simple and effective VHS cleaner", "unixReviewTime": 1396224000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2014"}
