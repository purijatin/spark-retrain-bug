They have definitely done it for years, with accessories, and continue to do so. While many people have stopped owning VCR's, there are some that still do after all these years, and Maxell is still making those aids for it. This Maxell Dry Tape Head Cleaner handles very well, and works in a instant. It is very easy to read and understand, and should not die down. It will last around 100 times for use in your VCR, and definitely is worth the money. While, it can take a bit out of you if you do overuse it, it should keep you VCR from any flaws for at least 10 years. I have always loved what Maxell had made with their electronics accessories, and this should definitely be a great buy.Price: BConvience & Quality: B+Overall: B 1/2+", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Head Cleaning", "unixReviewTime": 1355875200, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2012"}
