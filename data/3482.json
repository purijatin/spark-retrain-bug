I recently purchased theTerraTec G3 Video Digitizer with Scart Connector, USB 2.0 PC Interface, PAL, NTSC, SECAM Video Standards, for Mac & Windows.to convert all of my old VHS videos to digital format.  This product hooks up to the video OUT of your VCR, interfaces with your computer through USB, and records.  I no longer have my own VCR, so I had to borrow one from a friend.  I wanted to use this cleaner to ensure my friends VCR would be in top shape for the conversion.  Keep in mind that for all intents and purposes, I have not touched a VHS or a VHS player practically since DVDs became popular.  With that said, I popped this cleaner in my VCR in about every way I could think of and could not get it to play.  I tried to play it, rewind it, and fast forward... and then play it again.  The reels would just not spin.  Luckily, the VCR my friend let me borrow was a ridiculously nice unit that was paired with his home theater setup when VHS was still widely used.  It just did not need cleaning.I seem to remember that some VCRs may have been \"self-cleaning.\"  I could just be making that up, but perhaps this cleaner will not work with a self cleaning VCR?  Does anyone know anything about this?", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Reels would not spin...", "unixReviewTime": 1339027200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2012"}
