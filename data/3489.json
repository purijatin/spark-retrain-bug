I've had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs. This thing is a piece of junk and doesn't clean anything. First of all, the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for 20 seconds (always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you are...never let ego or testosterone get in the way, guys...use a little wisdom). The only problem is there isn't 20 seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette. It runs for 11 seconds and stops. Second, it's not good when you place one of these (or a tape) into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding 'grinding' noise. It happens whenever a tape has wrinkles in it and this thing did exactly that at the beginning each and every time I ran it through (I checked the actual tape and nothing looked out of the ordinary). I gave up after a bit to avoid any further problems. After running it a few times, it still did not do anything with the simplest of cleaning jobs. I can crack open the case and clean the heads by hand faster than this thing.Clearly I'll be looking for an alternative or simply taking care of the problem by hand.Bottom line, useless.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Garbage.", "unixReviewTime": 1323734400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2011"}
