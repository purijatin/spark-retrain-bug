They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great quality for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1225324800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2008"}
