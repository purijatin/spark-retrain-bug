They sound great, were easy to mount, and oh so inexpensive!  We've had some gatherings and the sound has been plenty and when sitting out quiet, it sounds great too.For the porch setup, I also purchased a stereo receiver (Sherwood) for $85.  My main goal was to allow radio play and to use an iPod as source for the screened porch.  Well, the sound is great (nice lows and can even blast all the neighbors), the components were cheap (except the iPod) and I can feel okay leaving the receiver outdoors (out of direct rain path, but definitely gets plenty of dust and humidity.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value", "unixReviewTime": 1186012800, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2007"}
