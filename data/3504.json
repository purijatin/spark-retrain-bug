I looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place, and took a chance on these Audio Source LS 200 speakers based upon the reviews here in Amazon.com. Although the reviews were good, one doesn't expect \"real\" quality at this price. You cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced! They are not as spacial as the Bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent.  Like the Bose they fall off rapidly below about 80Hz but are very linear up to the audible limits. (If you want more bass add a sub-woofer.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These Speakers Are A Bargain!", "unixReviewTime": 1072483200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2003"}
