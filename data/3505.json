I mounted them to my stucco-covered walls using toggle bolts to attach the included brackets.  These little speakers look great, and really have decent bass response considering their size.  [It probably helped they were mounted in corners.]I am greatly disappointed by the rusting of the metal face, though.  They have only been out for about six months and the mesh cover is already rusting.  Outdoor speakers should not have this issue - stainless or galvanized steel should have been used for the mesh and then painted.I would rate these four stars for sound, but only three because of the poor weathering.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sound, metal rusts...", "unixReviewTime": 1118793600, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2005"}
