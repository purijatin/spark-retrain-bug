Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome, but after use for a few hours, it is ok.  I understand that the new version (color) fixes these issues.  The display really does give the feel of paper.  Only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions.Overall love the product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nook", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}
