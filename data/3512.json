Yes the bass is a little low, but you are only paying thirty something dollars.  For the price the speakers are amazing, they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars.  I put a pair of Inifinity Outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource.  So I took the Inifinity's back and had enough money to buy a 300 disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the deck.I would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price.  If you are looking for surround sound speakers, then look elsewhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You get more than you pay for!", "unixReviewTime": 1101168000, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2004"}
