I placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier.  I live in rainy Houston, we have had 4 or 5 heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine.  This pair was a great price, arrived very quickly, and sounds just fine.  Buy it and save money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very cool piece of equipment", "unixReviewTime": 1123545600, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2005"}
