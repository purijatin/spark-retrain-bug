Agbay", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought this model because it was cheaper than the Sparkplug model in white with an L-shaped plug. Well, the straightness of the plug couldn't withstand normal use, and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much. Good sound and sound-blocking, but not durable if you plan to move your MP3 player in and out of your pocket.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poor model, not durable, stopped working after 6 mos", "unixReviewTime": 1239753600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2009"}
