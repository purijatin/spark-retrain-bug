Plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling! For $10 you get something that paying $100 wouldn't compete with.I've traveled with my friend and his high dollar Bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable (since the don't sit in the ear) the isolation was just as good.Mine wore out after a little over a year, so I mailed them back to Koss since they have a lifetime warranty, and I got a new pair.Can't beat that.Only downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little sore.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great, cheap and Koss Replaces for free", "unixReviewTime": 1203033600, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2008"}
