They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less (no matter how many) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here.  Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good (usually last me about 2 months) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good.  They fit well and stay in good too.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "useless warranty", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}
