They're just plain astounding - especially for the money.  If you want to buy something that beats all three, get the Creative EP-830's.  Incredible sound that just barely beats these little Koss buds - but they're $50.  For the money, the Koss can't be beat, period.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best for the money, and then some.", "unixReviewTime": 1223424000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2008"}
