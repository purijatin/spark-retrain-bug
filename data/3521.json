However, I've since switched to another brand of in-ear headphones (JVC Marshmallow--love 'em) due to several shortcomings of this product:- difficulty in acheiving optimum sound: you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get well-balanced sound- cheap cord: it's too thin and flimsy, tangles too easily- cranial reverb: every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn't really that great compared to the JVCsThere are better value choices out there; I'd recommend skipping these.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "not that great...", "unixReviewTime": 1207267200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2008"}
