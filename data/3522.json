Most earbuds are useless because at high speed the wind noise drowns out everything.  In fact, wind noise is so bad that I normally have to wear earplugs.Enter the Koss earbuds.First, the sound. *Great* sound, very accurate with excellent range. Headphones aren't worth it if the sound does not satisfy.These *more than* satisfy.Second, the applicability to the task.The earplugs supplied with the earbuds are darn good and will work for most applications.  I decided that I wanted something even more custom, so I cut up some of my normal motorcycle-riding foam plugs and fitted them over the earphones.  The result is excellent.  Even at 80 mph I get good sound with comfort and acceptable windnoise reduction.If you want absolute noise isolation plus sound, I recommend you get large-size soft foam earplugs.  Drill out a hollow shaft through the center.  To do this, heat up a 3/32&quot; drill bit, force it through one end and then twist repeatedly to cut out a shaft.  Press the earplugs over the small tube on the earphone, then apply the earplugs according to the instructions on the earplug package.*Purchasing Note*I was suspicious of the Circuit City pickup option, but tried it anyway.  I was *very* pleased.  Circuit City confirmed the purchase within 20 minutes, and I picked up the headphones the same evening.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works Great!
