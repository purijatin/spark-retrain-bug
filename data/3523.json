The Sures are sturdy, very inconvenient to use, and I couldnt get them to seal properly in my ears no matter how much fidgeting I did.  So I bought the Plug, another MX500, and still saved at least 25 bucks over the Sure productThe Plug sounds terrific for the money.  The sound isolation was good and they were easy to fit to your ear properly and produced a good all around sound revealing sounds absent when I use my Sennheisers.  The bass is more prominent but didnt seem out of balance...it was just easier to hear and a little muddy &lt;what can you expect for 12 bucks?>.  I listen to a lot of rockin blues, and these are perfect because you can hear the typical basslines in a standard blues band group better.Is the Plug better than the Sure which is far more expensive?  For me it is, but only because I could get the Plug to seat properly in my ears and couldnt with the Sure. I think the Sure e2c's would sound awesome if they would fit properly, albeit lots more inconvenient to use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What a bargain !", "unixReviewTime": 1191974400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2007"}
