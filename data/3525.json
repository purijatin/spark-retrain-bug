Decided to splurge (over $300) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from Shure and hated them and sent them back. Then I tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound, aesthetics and discrete form. I simply love them. As a frequent traveller, I appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane. Highly recommend them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tried super expensive product, found these better!", "unixReviewTime": 1144713600, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2006"}
