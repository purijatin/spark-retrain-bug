They fit and seal well, block as much ambient noise as safety ear plugs, and they sound awesome to me. I use them with a sansa clip zip at work 12 hours a day 6 days a week and they are comfortable. They require less volume to be used than some competitors brands(saving battery life) to reach a desired level and will certainly go loud enough to make you deaf if you push them. Using the sansa's equalizer allows me to adjust the levels to fit my music and tastes to a sweet sound. I listen to mostly hard rock, classic rock, country, and some blues and I find that while maybe they aren't audiophile quality they are really good for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I have loved these a long time", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}
