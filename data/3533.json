(These are not cat toys but how do you convey that to a cat that doesn't listen anyway?) The pair I bought before these was for a family member who still loves them and has given a pair as a gift to a few friends.When inserted correctly, these are better than the $200+ Bose noise cancelling headphone and MUCH cheaper. The sound quality is outstanding and the cable is durable... except when a cat plays with it. I do suggest you purchase the ear bud replacements as well since these can get a bit funky after being used for a while. Also, make sure you purchase the correct ear buds. I learned the hard way that Koss makes different buds for their headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Keep Buying Them for a Reason", "unixReviewTime": 1397692800, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2014"}
