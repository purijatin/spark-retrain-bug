Linder", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "At this price point, you're not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noise-canceling ability. I'd say that I've gone through a pair every few years, and I'll continue to buy these as needed. They block some sound, the sound quality is fine, and you won't be devastated when you realize that you've forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1373068800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2013"}
