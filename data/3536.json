I purchased these headphones for myself to use at the gym so I can keep them in my ears and the plastic won't hurt me after a bit of use (like most do) and my husband took them and fell in love with them.  He used them all the time and had them with him camping and sadly lost them in his camp fire so we purchased each of us a pair the second time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "So nice we bought them twice", "unixReviewTime": 1167782400, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007"}
