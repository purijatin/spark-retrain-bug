These work perfectly. The fit will be different for different ears, I actually turn the foam around to stick the bigger side in first. Once they seal, I get deep bass, clear music, and isolation from outside noise, so I don't have to listen to them as loud to get that \"my own world\" feeling.Only drawback, they do wear out. I've gone through 3 sets in about 4 years, first set the foam wore out, replaced just the foam then the foam piece would keep falling out. Second set, same thing. The third set is the only one that actually broke. I use them to work out, and one of the cables started to go, the one side would turn on and off depending on how you moved the cable.For the price, if they only last a year, it's still worth it. Sound quality is great, Isolation is great, and I've returned $100 set's that promised \"Amazing deep bass\" that didn't even compare to the base I get with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I've ever had", "unixReviewTime": 1282780800, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2010"}
