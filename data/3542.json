Webster", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I purchased these portable headphones based on information in a review by an Amazon customer.  They are great.  I replaced the earphones I received with my Zen Nano and I am so pleased. These are really superior to what came with my Zen Nano. They block out most of the outside sound and my CD recordings sound super.Since I go to the gym every day, I love the fact that these \"stay put\" and allow me to do my daily routine.  They can pretty much be molded by squeezing the eartips themselves and letting them expand when you put them in your ear.I would absolutely buy another set of Koss Plugs.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>UPDATE-January 2009-These portable headphones are still going strong and I use them 5 days a week at the gym.  I am so pleased, that when the time comes, I will definitely purchase Koss again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love the fit", "unixReviewTime": 1175817600, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2007"}
