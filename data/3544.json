Ervin", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "If you want to go jogging or work out while listening to music, these headphones will stick in your ears like an earplug, staying put until you explicitly try to remove them. Since they block out sound well and stick close to your eardrum, they can produce very powerful and clear sound despite their size. They hide pretty well. Their foam piece is cheap online and easy to replace, which is important because they will wear out with all the squishing to make them fit in your ears. Best of all, they are cheap.Please keep in mind, though, that they pretty much function as earplugs. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. If you go jogging and fail to look both ways at roads, you may not notice a car approaching. However, if you want to be alone with your music and your thoughts (such as if you are ADD) then will serve you well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best jogging headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1291334400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010"}
