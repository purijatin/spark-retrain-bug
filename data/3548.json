They do a fair job isolating outside noise, though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces.  The audio quality is basically what I'd expect at this price point, so no real complaint there.But the cables are terrible. Stiff and they transfer the noise of everything they touch.  Any slight movement that rubs against the wires translates that sound into your ears.  If you want to sit perfectly still, that's not a problem.  But terrible for the gym or most any other part of life that includes movement on your part.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sound is good, cables are horrid.", "unixReviewTime": 1352678400, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2012"}
