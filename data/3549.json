However, after owning two pairs over the last couple years & experimenting with them in every way I can think of, I cannot get them to stay inside my ears. You would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure & not popping out. Koss gives you different size covers, but all of them do the same thing; within a minute or two, these always pop out. The cord is also unnecessarily long. It is a shame, because  they do sound quite good, and when they are in securely, they isolate noise around you, making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music. I recommend you spend a bit more money & buy the Shure E2c earhones, which give you a number of ear canal fittings, and which sound VERY MUCH better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sound good, but probably won't stay in YOUR ears!", "unixReviewTime": 1137801600, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2006"}
