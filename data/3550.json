So I focused my research on in-the-ear buds that would hopefully stay in my ears without constant adjusting. Onto the pros/cons:PROS* Block outside sounds out well. You can stick them in your ears a little for a little sound blocking, or really roll up the foam and deeply embed them into your ears for near silence.* The sound blocking really lends to the quality of the sound output since you hear more of the music and less of whatever else is going on around you.* Produces a lot more sound output at the same volume. I attribute this to cancelling outside noise and channeling all the output right into your ears. Does this benefit battery life since you're running reduced volume? I'd think so, but probably not a noticable amount.* Nice long cord.* Seemingly good quality.* Includes extra foamies.CONS:* You have to sick them INTO your ear. Some people probably would hate this.* They can block virtually all outside noise. Someone could be axe murdering my family while I listen to music with these things and I'd never hear it. Seriously.* If the cord gets tugged on or pulled it can transmit \"noise\" to your ears due to the fact the plugs are IN your ear. This is minor but annoying and it happens to me somewhat frequently since I primarly use this with my Shuffle in the gym.* I find the bass to be muddy. However, this is the case with every earbud I've used. Consider the price of these it's a very minor complaint.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great ear buds if you don't mind things IN your ear", "unixReviewTime": 1170028800, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2007"}
