A great value.  Sound quality is good, and the design of the \"plugs\" helps filter out noise.  I found these to be great on an airplane, allowing me to relax to my music, while filtering out engine noise, conversations, etc...  Highly recommended...UPDATE: I still agree with everything I wrote in my original review, but I've gone through few of these now.  After 4-6 months, one of the ear buds goes dead or becomes intermittent.  The wire seems to be worn or fatigued over time due to use, It's a cheap item, so maybe the price is still worth it... but just know that it may not be a very durable pair of earbuds...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Grat comfort, great value... but not very durable", "unixReviewTime": 1163376000, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2006"}
