The closed-in ear piece helps keep out the sound of the lawn mower or chatty gym-rats on their cell phones.  These also have the deepest bass of any other earbuds I've tried -- too much for some, but those that like rock or metal should dig 'em.A couple things to note:  A brand new set might have a few issues with falling out, but once the cushions are \"broken in\" they stay in the ear with no problems.  Also, the cushions occasionally soak up sweat and become soft and pinched in the ear.  Lastly, they are almost alway gross after use!It takes a while to get used to the pressure in the ear, but I can't switch after getting used to these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good price and sound", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}
