This completely nullifies any sound isolation gained by the earplug style ear buds! It provided absolutely no noise cancelation on my plane ride.  I had to hold my fingers over the 6 holes to block out the engine noise pouring in through the back of the ear bud.The next problem is in construction. I am a tall guy.  The little eat buds are too small for my ears, so I use the larger plugs included.  They are too long and the plastic tube they fit over is too short.  The foam extends well past the plastic support tube, allowing the tip of the earbud to be squished closed as it sits in your ear. As a result, sometimes you hear nothing.Finally, the plastic fitting of the ear bud, where the foam meats the housing of the ear bud, has a rough edge on it.  I found it scratching my ear and it eventually caused a small sore, after the 15 hour flight I was on...Other than that, the speakers provide fairly good sound.  If it weren't for all the other problems, I'd say these were good ear buds.  But, because of the several flaws, I wish it didn't cost so much to ship these back and get a refund.  As far as I am concerned, I wasted $10 on these...", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Open back nullifies noise cancelation capabilities", "unixReviewTime": 1402963200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2014"}
