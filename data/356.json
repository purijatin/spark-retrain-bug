No matter how hard I try I just can't force myself to try and read a book on the little 3\" by 5\" screen. The display is small, dim and has poor contrast so it's hard to read unless it's in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly. It won't play very many types of books besides pdf files and Kindle books are not compatible. Also it goes to sleep if you don't keep constantly moving your finger around on it. Also it's supposed to be able to browse the web but the Web function doesn't do anything but show a Picture of a web page that talks about it's features but if that did work it would be useless since there's no mouse and no way to move around on the page. It can play MP3's that sound ok but it's 100's of times bigger than an iPod and too large to carry around.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Useless Gimmick", "unixReviewTime": 1306713600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2011"}
