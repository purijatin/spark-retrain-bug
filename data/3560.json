The sound is pretty decent for the price IF IF you get them inserted and postioned correctly.  If they are slightly out of perfect insertion (easy to do), either bass or highs will suffer.  With that said, I really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better.  As I said, it is a hassle to get a good insertion/fit with these (the pinch/roll/wait for expansion thing is not quick).  Once you do, you don't want to move around because they will shift and/or fall out very easily in my experience. This last point is a deal killer for me.  Save up $20 more and go with the Sony EX81L if you are on a budget or look at the Shure line if you have money to burn.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "If you are an a budget and don't plan to be mobile...", "unixReviewTime": 1129766400, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2005"}
