Munchel", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I was looking for something to replace the headphones that came with my iPod since they're EXTREMELY uncomfortable but I do like the sound quality. I've been through about 3 different kinds. Some I've passed off due to comfort and some due to bad sound quality. These ear buds are like putting the small foamy ear plugs in your ears. I've always found them pretty comfortable and these headphones are the same. The sound quality is very different than the iPod ear buds and FULL OF BASS. They also certainly block out a lot of background noise. Like I said, they're like putting in the foamy earplugs. I highly recommend these headphones, especially like the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable, full of bass Headphones - replaced iPOD headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1146009600, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2006"}
