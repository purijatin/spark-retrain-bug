Though my headphones were already not the best (blah set that came with my MP3 player), I hadn't had the inclination/energy to buy another pair until I was desperate.  In other words, I was too lazy.  Well, I was now headphone-less and desperate, so it was time to spring for a new one.I tend to like the \"in ear\" headphones because of the sound quality that comes through in loud environments (loud cities, subway, airplanes, road noise).  I bought the Koss \"Plug\" with hopes that the earplug-like earbuds would fit perfectly into my ears. I have normal-sized ears and don't usually have problems with store-bought earplugs for bedtime.  However, no matter how much I played around with the foam plugs on the Koss set, after 5-10 minutes of fantastic sound (yes, the sound IS amazing!), the plugs would just voluntarily fall out of my ears, for no apparent reason.  I tried squeezing, pinching, twisting, pushing, pulling, and even switching various plug sizes, etc...but with no luck.  And even though I'm feeling the burden of returning to the store (Circuit City--Amazon's price is cheaper), my Koss Plug is going back.  I don't want to super-glue the plugs into my ear to listen to music.  That's not the idea here.But, take note: the bass and general sound of \"the plug\" IS fantastic.  If it fits your ears (lucky thing, you), stick with this one for the sound and the cost.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.  It will only add to your pile of \"things I may use one day\" and we all have too much of that stuff, don't we?", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Sound, Poor Fit", "unixReviewTime": 1097452800, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2004"}
