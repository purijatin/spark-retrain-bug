The foam them re-expands blocking out sounds and noise letting you hear your music, books, etc. much cleaner. The foam on these In-Ear-Headphones is easily replaceable and come with a replacement set.KOSS has been known for years for their quality sounds equipment and these headphone/ear-bud's are no exception. The sound quality of these was 100% BETTER than my BOSE ear-bud headphones and the noise blocking was unsurpassed with these KOSS &#34;The Plug&#34; headphones. They have even replaced my $249.00 headphones with their quality and great sound experience.A word of caution however, they do block sounds around you, so make sure not to wear them if you need to hear anything else around you. Then again you might want too especially when those around you are boring and annoying!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Think Safety Foam Ear-Plugs that PLay Great Music!", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}
