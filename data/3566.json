They are somewhat heavy on the bass side but thats ok with me since its not overkill and you can always adjust the bass with an EQ. I did not read any of the reviews before buying them as they were cheap enough, but now im amazed at how good they sound. I wont tell you these are great, just letting you know they are a good to try. I also liked the KSC75's which for a few $$ more are another great buy and sound better but are clip-on (over ear) style.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the price !", "unixReviewTime": 1172880000, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2007"}
