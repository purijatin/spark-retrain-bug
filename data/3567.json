I hate wearing full-size headphones, as I wear glasses and the ear pads always jam the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull and hurt me after a short while. These Koss buds are very comfortable.I also travel on airplanes quite a bit and don't want to fork out the big bucks for hissy noise-cancellation so this seemed like a good compromise. These plugs seal out external noise quite well.They are also reasonably efficient, and have STACKS of bass - sometimes I have to use the EQ on my MP3 player to knock the bass down a bit. The top end is a little bit messy (cymbals don't sound that clear), but the overall performance is very good; considering the price.Very lightweight. Cable is very thin.They came with a set of about 5 replacement sponge ear plugs.No built-in volume control.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good - could do with a tad more treble", "unixReviewTime": 1141257600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2006"}
