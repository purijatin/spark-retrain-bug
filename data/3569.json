Also, they are ported (holes on the outside of the housing to allow pressure transfer, but which don't seem to diminish noise isolation.Pro: The noise isolation with these is great: The eartips are the squishy foam, just like Hearos and other earplugs.  The result is a really good seal with your ear canal.  When riding the bus or walking around, I am able to turn my iPod down from 50-70% volume to around 10-20%. It's a huge difference.Con: The cord is composed of a spongy, grippy rubber. It's the perfect material to use on those dashboard grips you see advertised, where you put something on it (like a cell-phone) and it stays put. However, for a cord it's annoying, as it prevents you from wrapping it, and it just feels stiff and icky. The cord also transfers a lot of vibration noise to your ears when you are in motion. Maybe this is normal for all ear-canal headphones? I don't have enough experience with them. It's my guess that a less stiff, springy material might have been better.Solution: run the cord for one ear over the back of your neck (if your neck is small enough) as it will reduce the pull on your ears.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Excellent Isolation, Terrible Cord", "unixReviewTime": 1226188800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2008"}
