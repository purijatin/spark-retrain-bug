I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 Stars plus 5 more", "unixReviewTime": 1279843200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2010"}
