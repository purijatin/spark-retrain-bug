This is my first purchase of the in the ear type. I never expected the fit to be as comforatble as I found it to be, and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is. I think that Koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product. On top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee. How can you beat this bargain?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great  earphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1159488000, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2006"}
