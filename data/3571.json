I bought the Plug in order to replace the Ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym. Needless to say I have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them.  I shoved them as far as I could up my ear canal, up to the point of pain.  Sound was mediocre at best compared to the \"Stock\" earphones that came with the Ipod.  It is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings.  Standard Ipod sets are way better.On the other hand I did not expect anything great due to the price.  You mostly get what you pay for!  Now I'm waiting for my Etymotic ER-6i Isolator head set which should (hopefully) be of better comfort and sound quality.My advice is to spend a few more dollars in order to get a good set.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't plug the plug", "unixReviewTime": 1131926400, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2005"}
