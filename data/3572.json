I've got little ears and find these extremely uncomfortable.  I shoot shotguns, so I know how to use foam ear plugs but these are just too big for me.  I'll probably give them to my husband who has big old ears. Most other ear buds I've bought include three sizes of ear cushions, these have only two....big and bigger. The sound quality is heavy on bass with no treble.  I don't know squat about ohms and hz or other sound lingo but I do know what I like to hear in my music and these just don't cut it for me.  I usually don't pay more than $20 for ear buds because the right ear sound always quits after awhile.  Even the Bose had this problem after 18 months.  These looks like they are well made and I do like the fact that there's a flex joint at both the ear buds and the plug-in.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "For Big ears", "unixReviewTime": 1382313600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2013"}
