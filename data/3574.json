Then I saw someone mentioned the purple v.s. blue (earlier version), and I purchased it again, making sure it was purple.  Sure enough, the purple ones are great!  Like other Koss headphones, you not only hear the bass, but you also feel it.  It's amazing that such big bass can come out of these tiny earplugs.  I replaced the included foam plugs with regular plugs from a drugstore and they make an even better seal.I also have the Etymotic ER6i, which costs at least 7 times more than this one.  When it comes to sound, of course the ER6i have a much higher fidelity (but much less bass), but considering the price difference, I think these Koss earplugs have a greater value.  Overall, the sound quality is just average, but if you mostly listen to pop while on the road, you probably won't mind or care that some notes are a little imbalanced and muddy.  As far as sound isolation go, after replacing the included foam plugs with the ones from the drugstore, they are as good as the etymotics.Be sure to get the purple ones!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great value!", "unixReviewTime": 1103760000, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2004"}
