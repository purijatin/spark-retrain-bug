They are very comfortable to wear for long periods, have terrific bass, good sound and are comfortable to wear when in bed.  One's opinion of headphone sound is very subjective and comparison is limited because you cannot instantly change from one phone to another. One reason that there are endless opinions of headphone sound.The Plug has foam inserts that expand too fast making it almost impossible to get it into the ear before it expands.  If you do not get a good air seal, there will be little or no bass.The fix is to buy a set of  foam ear plugs (Walmart $1.47 for 12).  Squeeze it flat, use a scissor for cut proper length, re-squeeze under water, let it expand full size, freeze it and then drill the hole to replace the existing foam insert.  You will end up with an ear plug that really works and is very comfortable to wear. You probably will be so happy with \"The Plug\" that you won't have to upgrade to the $300 models!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Way to Try Ear-Canal Phones", "unixReviewTime": 1124236800, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2005"}
