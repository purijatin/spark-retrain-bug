I have probably about 25 sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes.  Not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes I use these for (casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation) these are perfect. They're the only device I'll use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop.  I love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your ears.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1349222400, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2012"}
