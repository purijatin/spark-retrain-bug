The foam inserts are far more comfortable than any other style I have worn.  The sound quality exceeds standard headsets that generally come with MP3 players and Walkman stereos.  They are not audiophile caliber, but considering the price, they sound fine.  I wear them while running and they're sweatproof, so far -- and unaffected by any \"stethoscope\" effect that other reviewers have noted about Sony earphones.  I can also adjust how deep I place the plug in my ear canal, enabling me to hear the environmental sounds (sirens,horns,etc.)that affect my saftey, when running in public places.It's too early to comment on durability, but I do treat them carefully, as I would any lightweight/portable headphones.An excellent buy at under $15.00", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound, great comfort and fit for runners", "unixReviewTime": 1129852800, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2005"}
