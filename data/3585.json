Some reviews say that it is bass heavy. If you have an EQ mode on your Mp3 Player then try that to adjust the sound to your liking. Ipods and Zunes players have good EQ Settings. Love the ear cushions. They fit really good. Would recommend these headphones especially for the priceNote:To get the Cushions to fit in properly. try this, lightly squeeze the foam then insert in to your ear and hold for about 5 sec. it should form inside the ear and you not have a problem of them slipping out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love the BASS", "unixReviewTime": 1358985600, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2013"}
