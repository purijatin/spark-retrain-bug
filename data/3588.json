They still worked but the foam died.  I bought another pair, and have concluded these are overall the best buds for the price.Edit #2:After ordering a second pair and using them for a bit, they too have given way and the expansive response of the foam no longer prevails amidst the sweat, etc.  Therefore I am off to buy my 3rd set.  For such a low price, I really could care less.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Comfortable, stay put, BEST value for price", "unixReviewTime": 1264118400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2010"}
