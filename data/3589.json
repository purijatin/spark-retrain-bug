Lopez III", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Now these are not balanced to start with, more boost in the muddy area (200hz-300hz). But with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good. They rival even my Sony MDR-7509HDs when this cut is applied. I also have an communications headset from Koss, SB-49 for $50, which I've used for gaming AND mixing audio. Koss just makes great sounding gear, but pay for the high end stuff to get out-of-the-box balanced.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss is the name in Great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1371168000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2013"}
