{"reviewerID": "A3D822N1K2IAQD", "asin": "B00001P4XA", "reviewerName": "Kenneth Stuart", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewtext": "I was intrigued by the raves for these very inexpensive headphones, and the Koss brand name convinced me to give them a try.I compared them to the Sennheiser HD56 headphones that I normally use for portables, and my AKG 240DF headphones that have been used by many studio engineers in recording albums.The Koss The Plug headphones have excellent dynamic range and sensitivity.  This means that you will get more volume out of weaker amps, such as those found in multipurpose portables, like PDAs and portable synths, like the Yamaha QY series.  They also have excellent bass, which together with the dynamic range, makes them excellent for any sort of modern dance music.Unlike another reviewer, I did not find any problem with the midrange or high end.  I suspect that this perception some people have had, is due to the fact that increasing the bass automatically makes the midrange and highs seem muted - especially in headphones.As others have mentioned, the fit is critical to the sound quality.  Read the instructions found on the inside of the card in the packaging.  Even the orientation of the earphones in your ear can affect the sound.  Experiment a little until you find the best sound.WARNING:  These headphones can go very loud with portables that have decent amps (MP3 and CD players).  Famous musicians like Pete Townsend and Jeff Baxter have hearing problems from hours of loud music - so be careful!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent value with many good qualities", "unixReviewTime": 1040083200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2002"}
