Holmes", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I was looking for headphones that I could be comfortable with for long periods of time.I use my mp3 player for listening to audio books, and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears.  I also didn't want to spend a fortune.After much looking I decided to give these a try, and they have worked out great.  They are comfortable for as long as I wear them which has been many hours at a time.The cables are too long, which seems to be the case with any heaphones I've seen, so that's something to live with. For the price I don't think they can be beat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1174608000, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2007"}
