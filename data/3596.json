Just my 2 to tell everyone who's curious aboutthese KOSS \"Plug's\" as I was a week ago.Very comfy in my ear. Stay put w/o falling-out.GREAT sound, deep bass & I still hear the highs too.Brings my mp3 player \"ALIVE\" at last.The free extra set of \"rubber/foam\" tips is great!Mine came in \"BLACK\", although any of the available colorslook great IMO.I started to buy the newer version of the KOSS earplugscalled the \"SparkPlug\", but after reading alot of userreviews, opted to buy these instead.They are well worth the $14. Don't hesitate if you're considering thisbrand. They have a LIFETIME guarantee (no questions asked).You'll be glad you got them...Hard to believe that some other brands sell for upwards of several hundred dollars.They simply CAN'T sound much (if ANY) better than these do. PERIOD", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Finally, an earphone, earbud or whatever that WORK's !!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1215302400, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2008"}
