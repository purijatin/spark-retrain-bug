If you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears, they expand and fit to your ears. Helps to block outside noises, and makes them comfortable. They feel secure and don't fall out if I'm moving around. Great for people who like to walk around with an ipod. Great bass, which is really important to me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good quality, low price", "unixReviewTime": 1380412800, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2013"}
