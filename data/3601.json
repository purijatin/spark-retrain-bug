I've got smaller-than-normal ears and the buds are really painful after a while. These Koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in.

Definitely worth ordering.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones at a tiny price", "unixReviewTime": 1378944000, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2013"}
