This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner. The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals. The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big. Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes. (The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't. I'm returning them.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Does not work under a helmet. Returning it :(", "unixReviewTime": 1332547200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2012"}
