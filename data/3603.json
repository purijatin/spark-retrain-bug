Here are my impressions:Shure E4c (isolating): the most accurate and open I know of. With high-quality source electtronics and material, these (or the E5c's) would be the pick of the lot. Unfortunately, they're too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an iPod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context. Their other disadvantage is obvious: they're quite expensive.Sennheiser PXC 300 (noise-cancelling): these are my favorites. Very accurate without being too unforgiving for an iPod. Their disadvantages:  comparatively bulky & won't play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here.Sennheiser CX300-B (isolating): considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the PXC 300, these are also quite good. Bass can be very tubby (that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts, but that would more than double the price)Koss \"The Plug\" (isolating): laughably innacurate. Buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes. Otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1178755200, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2007"}
