This seemed like the perfect alternative.And it *could* be.  However, the &quot;slow-recovery&quot; foam earplugs included are more like  fast-recovery. I've never seen foam earplugs that go to full size again so  fast. They really are tough to get in if you leave the headphones inserted.The trick I found was to slip the plugs off the headphone pieces, roll  it up really tight and insert JUST the plug into your ear. Then slightly  move it around until the hole for the headphone is lined up, and stick them  in through the hole. That's the only way I think you could ever get the  things in your ear.Other than that, I'm pleased enough with them. They  definitely are way more comfortable for me and stay in better than regular  earbuds. Really makes you wonder though, if they even had actual consumers  try the earplugs out before releasing them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice idea, could be better implimented.", "unixReviewTime": 966988800, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2000"}
