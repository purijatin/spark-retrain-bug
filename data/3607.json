Those worked ok (though they were still a little uncomfortable.) When I ordered this new version of Plugs I could not get them to fit right and the sound was really tinny. Fortunately I found the Sony EX-70LPs.  Much more comfortable than these, thank goodness!  No earphones fit everyone well, and the Koss earphones don't work well at all it you have shallow ears.  The Sony's also cost three times more than the Koss, but the comfort is worth it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not comfortable at all - even modified", "unixReviewTime": 1043452800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2003"}
