I'm wacky about them) but not by much. As was mentioned, they do crap out-- I've had one that quit working and another that broke while I was treating it very roughly. Anyway, I think that these are ideal if your player has an EQ on it. These, contrary to what another poster has mentioned, are *very* bassy. I've found that by plugging just about half of the little holes on the back attenuates the bass if an EQ isn't an option. They block sound quite well, better than any other non-active NR headphones I've used.The weakness in my experience has been treble-- I use the EQ to boost the treble and drop the bass and these sound spectacular (I have to do the opposite for my Grado headphones). I don't think that you could find anything better for this price (and I've tried). The other nice thing is that if they DO break or get lost, it's no big deal! Pair these with a cheap 1GB SanDisk player (the cheap SanDisks that I've used have EQs) and you have a nice, low-risk investment for the gym or anywhere else where they might be damaged.As for the poor bass comment-- they are tricky to get seated at first. Poorly seated Plugs will sound tinny and weak.Give them a shot! Not much to lose here.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Aboslutely The Best Under $80", "unixReviewTime": 1206921600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2008"}
