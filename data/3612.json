For $10 I take that over the $300+ stuff any day!!  The bass is a bit strong for my taste, but I can adjust that on my MP3 player... I must warn you though, I'm not a audio file... I like a good sound, but that's about it...so if you try headphones like some people taste wines...then forget about my review...but if you want something that blocks the outside noise enough (I couldn't hear my loan mower while the music was playing, at all!!) while you listen to your music and don't want to spend a fortune, these things are great!! I'll be buying another set as soon as these die for sure!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the price...these things are good!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1129507200, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2005"}
