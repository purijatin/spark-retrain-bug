Bjerk", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought 'The Plug' after reading all kinds of reviews for it and similar products. It really is a nice stereophone for the money. The sound quality is very good and I have not noticed that it has too much bass as several other reviews said. The ear-plug like ear pieces are pretty comfortable (I wear mine up to 8 hours a day) and provide moderate sound insulation. I would estimate they cut noise 10-15db (comparing them to the performance of earplugs rated at 32db). The only concern I have is that they are a little bit flimsy. I wear them every day at work in machine shop so the sound dampening is essential and enables me to listen to music except when using the noisiest machines.A great buy for the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Sound quality, moderate sound insulation", "unixReviewTime": 1169078400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2007"}
