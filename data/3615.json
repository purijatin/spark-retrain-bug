I read some reviews and ordered these. First off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs. You squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand. They must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear. If you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass. If you like exaggerated heavy bass these are for you. As for the guy who said buy a dozen or half dozen and thank him later, Idon't think that that's necessary. They are very nice sounding for the price and work good in the gym for me. If your mp3 player has an eq you can select a curve that makes them sound more realistic. Hope that helps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice for the price if you like bass.", "unixReviewTime": 1164844800, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2006"}
