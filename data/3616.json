The foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear, even after hours. It requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion, put it in your ear canal, hold it and wait for it to expand, then carefully remove hand, but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit. The dark purple plastic is a little strange, and they do look funny, but that is a very minor detail. Great product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1256428800, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2009"}
