I used an awl to make a hole in the earplug, and then cutoff a bit off the top of the earplug. I cut it off a bit too much,just cut it off a little.The sound from this product is great for an earbud style headphone.To increase isolation, I use a hearing protector ear muff on top of The Plug and I really can't hear anything after doing it.The main point, buy foam earlugs and these things will be a lot more comfortable and will let you enjoy your music more by eliminating background noise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound, bad ear cushions", "unixReviewTime": 962236800, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2000"}
