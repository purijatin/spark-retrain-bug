In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear.  The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more).  The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor.  There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592.  Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Tinny, underwhelmed, get Philips HE592 instead", "unixReviewTime": 1205712000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2008"}
