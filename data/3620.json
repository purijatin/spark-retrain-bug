You could spend $100+ for a noise cancelling pair of headphones, but I find that these headphones do equally good of a job (i have a pair of Creative noise cancelling headphones, and I prefer the Koss Plug).\"w/modification\"...If you replace the provided foam plugs with regular foam ear plugs, you will get a much better fit. Do this by triming a regular pair of foam ear plugs to the length of he \"canal\" on The Plug. Then drill a hole through the center using a small drill bit or use a needle and work around to make the hole bigger. This process is tedious I will admit, BUT having a clean pair (negates the CON listed below) that fits better than the provided foam plugs is well worth it. You will also find that the replacement plugs will stay compressed longer, making it easier to insert into your ear.CONS:the rubber \"canal\" that channels sound to your ear can fall off easily... if lose that.. its all over (this is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Build up of ear wax on the plugs (no matter how well u clean ur ears, you will get some dirt build up on these things.. replace the plugs every few months using modification above)PROS:price... deep bass (even w/o \"super bass\" systems)... noise \"cancelling\" ability (w/ modification listed above)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Noise cancelling wannabe's (w/ modification)", "unixReviewTime": 1102291200, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2004"}
