Very comfortable fit. Balanced sound. Come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs. Potential problems: Not too good with treble highs. I recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum 5-band equalizer or if you're not a treble fanatic. Also, the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long, but that's just speculation on my part since I've only had them for a few days. Finally, it insulates from all ambient sounds, so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important, then you should consider another design.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Subwoofer in your head", "unixReviewTime": 1160265600, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2006"}
