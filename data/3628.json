Correct me if I wrong.This was my \"Father's day\" gift from my daughter, my earlier KOSS Plug earphones which I purchased 7 years back (which still works) had very disgusting foam material due to daily use and abuse which my daughter could not tolerate, Seeing me squeezing that dirty foam into my ears made her buy me a new set of earphones! The new foam materials are better and hope this will last a decade just as the other.Buy with confidence these are excellent earphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "When every dollar counts!", "unixReviewTime": 1213574400, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2008"}
