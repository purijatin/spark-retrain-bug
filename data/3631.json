There's no mute button or detachable headband as on the previous version, and the claimed frequency response has been improved to 10 to 20,000 Hz.  They are inexpensive, and come with a \"limited\" lifetime warranty.As far as sound quality, it is very good.  More importantly, they block all background noise so that I can actually hear the music when I'm sitting at the back of a bus or in a noisy location.  I prefer to listen to music at a quiet volume and it's nice not to have to blast my eardrums out just to hear the music.  The fit is very secure, which I also like (I always felt like my iPod-style headphones were going to fall out of my ears).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Blocks all background noise", "unixReviewTime": 1105574400, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2005"}
