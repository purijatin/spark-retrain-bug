The really cheap ones are usually just that, cheap! I find the $10.00 to $40.00 range offer among the best qualities someone may be looking for in decent, good sounding earbuds. Most are good having varied degrees of what predominant type of sound you may be listening for.These Koss earbuds offer a very good bass range with overall good sound and volume. The mids and highs are not as crisp but usually can be adjusted well enough for good tone...these buds are mostly for strong bass.The fit of these earbuds is one of the most comfortable with nice cushy, foam inserts that stay in your ear well and really eliminate most outside noise. In turn, they also provide a very discreet listening experience. I find the best way to insert these buds is to give them a little squeeze and stick them in my ear and let the foam expand in my ear.Overall, the build quality of these earbuds appears to be quite good with minimal wire to bud noise transfer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Quality, Low Price & Good Sounding Bass", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2013"}
