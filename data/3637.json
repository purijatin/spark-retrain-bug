So don't expect $100 quality from these.If you still wonder what quality of sound these have, here's comparison with other KOSS products. This (The Plug), sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro, but sounds better than Koss UR10 (but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these \"plugs\" to be better then UR10). Hope this helps.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Why you expect HIFI sound from $12 headphones?", "unixReviewTime": 1266019200, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2010"}
