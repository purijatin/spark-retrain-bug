She uses it all the time and reads so much more now then before.  I hate having to pay for books she could just get from the library but our library now offers free books for the Nook that you can check out digitally for 2 weeks with no fees.  Now we get all sorts of books for it for free.  So happy with our purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My tween loves it", "unixReviewTime": 1308355200, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2011"}
