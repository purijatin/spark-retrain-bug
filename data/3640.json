I wear them practically every other day - exercising or working in the yard. These are actually better than the previous ones (from the same manufacturer) that I bought at a brick and mortar.  Those had a very annoying \"mute\" button on the cord. These do not. Compared to other ear plugs (or in the ear headphones) that I have, I can use these when I run or bike (in the summer) without them falling out. I've paid over $30 for others that didn't work half as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Ear plug review", "unixReviewTime": 1284768000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2010"}
