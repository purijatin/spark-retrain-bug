The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best low priced earbuds", "unixReviewTime": 1388620800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2014"}
