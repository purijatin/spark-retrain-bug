I did not purchase \"The Plug\" with expectations of anything near the experience I have had with the E2's.  The E2's are not perfect, however, and I've saved up some gripes for that review as well.In any case, I bought \"The Plug\" as a backup and alternative to my other headphones, and I have many.  On the New York City subways and city streets, isolating headphones are the only way to really hear your music without getting those huge over the ear style headphones.  I see everyone with the white iPod style earbuds - can you even hear your music?  I swear that I had to turn the volume up all the way to even hear the music over the din of the city streets.So, I'm already a convert to the in-ear experience.  These headphones, however, are a total bummer.  They don't fit in my ear with any of the built in foam inserts.  They hurt.  The sound is tinny, tiny and has no bass whatsoever.  I tried every permutation of different foam plugs with no luck.I'm sure the poor sound is entirely because they don't seal in my ear canal well.  I looked around on the web - other people are having the same problem, and have gone so far as to create their own foam plugs to fit their ears better.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time nor the inclination to bother.  So, back they go.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not for everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1096934400, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2004"}
