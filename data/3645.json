My kids (8 and 10) discovered them and now won't use any others.  They are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them.  Only downside is that they aren't very durable, but Koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love these and so do my whole family.", "unixReviewTime": 1314144000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2011"}
