For the most part, they fit nice, but you have to know how to insert them properly.  I roll them between my thumb and finger so that they are long as skinny, then insert them into my ear and wait for them to expand... just like putting in foam earplugs.  For me, they fit well, and seem like they'd stay in better than the rubber-tipped earbuds.It's a shame they sound like a Hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can.  These are bargain basement earbuds, so I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound like Sennheiser headphones, but I did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my off-brand earbuds that I got for like a dollar and a half on some Chinese *ahem* \"extreme deal\" website.  They don't.  The bass is just non-existant.  For something that isolates the air inside your ear canal, bass should be its strong point.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Decent fit, but TERRIBLE sound.", "unixReviewTime": 1311206400, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2011"}
