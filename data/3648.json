Lets face it, public or commercial transportation is not known for its quiet atmosphere. I'm sure you will agree that you are always trying to raise the volume high enough to drown out the background noise, but the headphones just can't do it. The Koss Plug is the answer.I spent 20 years in the Air Force and I have gone through three sets of these. These are the only headphones that I could use while riding on military cargo planes without wearing ear plugs and without cranking the volume to max. Ever time I thought I found something better, they never could reach the level of noise isolation that the Koss Plugs provide. The bass level is superior to every budget or midrange priced similar devices. If you don't mind wearing ear plugs, these are perfect for you. If you don't like wearing ear plugs, get over it; these plugs are worth the the annoyance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The ONLY headphones for travel", "unixReviewTime": 1335312000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2012"}
