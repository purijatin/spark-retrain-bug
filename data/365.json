If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself. I think it makes a much more user friendly product than Android tablets, and the price is good. Combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from Barnes & Noble, and you have a real competitor to the iPad and Kindle.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High quality e-reader iPad alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1346889600, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2012"}
