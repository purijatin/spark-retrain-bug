I also bought a pair of the Coby CVE92 ear buds because I thought they'd fit as well. Sure enough they do, but they sound terrible in comparison. In addition, these have a lifetime \"no questions asked\" warranty - that's gold, my friend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1202342400, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2008"}
