My first pair had a button to stop sounds and extra plugs plus a case. It broke two months after, since I tied it to make it shorter. One side wasn't functionning well because of that. I used it in the plane and it blocked 70% of the engine noise! Economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports. Also the plastic dried up(I don't know why!).My tip: never tie the wires! it causes the metalic wires inside to break. Because of this, it costs me hundreds of dollars.My second set was simpler, but at the same price as my first. No more annoying button to stop music. The tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubber(unlike totaly in plastic) so it's improved. The extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that I can't use. The main problem is that sometimes I sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breaks.Second tip: I have two versions, blue/yellow and purple/gray. What you get in the package is sorta different so choose carefully! The mute button can be easily pressed... so it's a small hint.Third tip: if it doesn't fit, change the plugs or turn and push it in your ear. It doesn't really fit when only pushed.Fourh tip: smaller plugs are better for best sound proof and quality.Finally: the plugs with break down, piece by piece, until it doesn't fit if you unplug and plug them often. The mute button was meant for that if it helps you purchase.I'll only buy these kind of earphones since it's like plugging your ears with rubber corks and istening to music at the same time. The price in Canada is kinda steep... if you buy it here you save 40%(with the currency and taxes)!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely the best!", "unixReviewTime": 1019174400, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2002"}
