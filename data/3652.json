I can ride in a blackhawk or chinook and listen to these at a comfortable volume, without hearing too much of the engine noise. a very minor thing is if you use these while running you will  hear yourself breathe a little louder than normal. its semi annoying, but im used to it now. would definately recommend for the price and quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Isolation Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1239408000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2009"}
