Good sound, inexpensive and they STAY in my ears and block external sounds quite well.Biggest complaint - the cord - rather the rubber used.  If they would upgrade the cord (to something more like the ipod headphones) this would be great.  The cord has &#34;memory&#34; for curls, bends, etc.  Won't stay straight. Just a bit annoying!Different productions have either straight or 90 degree phone jacks.  I have had both.  The 90 degree version seems more relaible.Only one oddity - different productions seem to have different sounding driver frequency responses.  Some of them seem to be overly bright (in treble) others seem to be heavy in the bass.  I just wish they were consistant.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great fit in the ear", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}
