At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs, so we have a total of 4 sets in the house. If you want audiophile quality, you'll need to pay a lot more, but at less than $20, these deliver decent sound and I don't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire. For sound I'd rate them 4 stars, for durability I'd give them 2 stars, and price is a 5.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cheap, usable earbuds", "unixReviewTime": 1204070400, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2008"}
