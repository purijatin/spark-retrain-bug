I used Koss for years and was a loyal customer. I kept having these break, at a rate of about one a month, and I was gentle with them! I think the company has seriously cut back on quality. I liked the sound and foam sound blocking, but reliability became a problem.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've owned several sets of earbuds and these are just great especially and truly when you consider you can get these for well under $20.For me the biggest issue with any ear bud or portable headphone is they let in far too much noise. You can spend a bazillion dollars on a set of snazzy phones, but if there's a baby crying next to you, well you're sound experience is going to be less than ideal. For a city denizen like me, common noise pollution is subway trains, sirens, chatty cell phone blatherers etc. Airplanes are another problem for portables because of noise.  The plug, by blocking outside noise so effectively, solves this problem.Another bonus you don't see often is that Koss backs all their products with a lifetime warranty.  Send them a check for $6 to cover shipping and they will fix or replace your plugs, even if you don't have a receipt!!The plug is big sound in a very portable package.  I'm hooked.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Stay away. Quality has declined.", "unixReviewTime": 1194480000, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2007"}
