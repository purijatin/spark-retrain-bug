There is a proper way to squish and insert earplugs, believe it or not.  Most people just press a couple times without any thought and shove.  You have to \"roll\" these between your fingertips really well, evenly, over and over.  If you don't, they will expand too fast and you'll have trouble, especially when new.  The more you use them, the better they get until the foam finally breaks down and you go to the replacement foam.  I only use these when traveling and they knock down the noise down from planes, considerably.  These are your best bet for the money.  Ignore the reviewers that state that their double and triple priced headphone are better.  DUH!!! What would you expect!!!  If you buy a car for 10,000 don't expect 20,000 or 30,000 dollar features and performance.  Someone actually compared these to 80 dollar Shure headphones!!!  Also, any self-proclaimed, pretentious, audiophile that buys these for 10 bucks and expects audiophile performance is just being ridiculous.  Come back to Earth, please.  I have used these on all forms of media and have yet to be disappointed.  They will definitely show the flaws in any recordings because the sound is isolated and aimed directly at your eardrum.  This is one reason I would NEVER give it to a little kid.  If you like to save space on your Ipod and go with a low quality setting, your mistake will be painfully obvious.  It will also be painfully obvious when you listen to the some of the cheap/low quality recordings and incompetent audio engineers of late.These will not fit everybody's ears on the entire planet!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love these little gems!", "unixReviewTime": 1218412800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2008"}
