I carefully squished the pads and let them expand in my ears forming a fairly high pressure seal.  They maybe take a couple Db off the road noise, barely taking the edge off.  I can drop down the volume a notch or two from where I would with my other open air Koss headphones.  But that is more because there is a tube shooting the music into your ears.  Sound is not up to my other cheap Koss headphones.  And the wires could literally not be any thinner or more delicate.  I bought these Koss because I like my other cheap Koss &#34;over-ear-clip open-air&#34; headphones so much and the cord was nice and  beefy on those.  I tried someones suggestion of replacing the pads with official ear plugs, trimmed to length and a hole punched through.  That helped a tiny bit more.  Noise leak seems to be right through the headphone itself.  If you try to replace the pads, I suggest, scissors, a heated ice pick, pointy chopsticks, and lots of patience.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Barely noise isolating, and cheaply made.", "unixReviewTime": 1383350400, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2013"}
