Russell \"Rick\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "These really are fine headphones, particularly for use inside a motorcycle helmet. But they are cheaply made compared to, for example, the headphones bundled in an iPod. The wiring insulation is a little sticky and gets tangled easily, and the wires themselves are high-gauge and skinny.EDIT: OK, after months of use, the Plug headphones just keep holding up for dozens and dozens of motorcycle trips. My earlier accusations of flimsiness were obviously ill-informed; these $14 headphones are a fantastic deal and they outlasted my iPod original headphones.EDIT 2: I finally beat the heck out of these headphones and decided to replace them after about 1.5 years of wearing a motorcycle helmet over them. Overall a very good value for the money. The new headphones work just as well, except that Koss has replaced the smooth PVC wire insulation with some new stuff that has a roughened, sticky texture. And it does stick, to itself and to everything else, making them slightly less functional.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good headphones, wish they made a tougher version", "unixReviewTime": 1190937600, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2007"}
