My only complaint is that I cant find the soft replacement ear buds. I have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll. Think I will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Product", "unixReviewTime": 1295136000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2011"}
