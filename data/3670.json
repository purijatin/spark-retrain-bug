These are for the person on the go and no I don't mean running. The foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise. The base is okay, but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it. I did this on my IPhone 3GS and I was please with the results. Other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music taste.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great travel headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1341878400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2012"}
