That they do, in a small, cheap package.  For that, they get a 2 instead of a 1.The bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well. But it simply sounded \"thuddy and muddy\" - we're talking quantity over quality in the bass department. In fact, these are probably the worst sounding headphones I've ever used. In the end, I preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones (a nothing-fancy Sony pair) than listening to these.I also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, but that can be a highly personal thing.All in all, the best part of these was taking them out.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Well, they do block out sound, at least.", "unixReviewTime": 1166140800, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2006"}
