I wanted to used headphones when watching BluRays or playing 360, so I got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier. Works beautifully; no noise and the volume is sufficient. Excellent product for this type of use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Used to control volume out of TV, WORKS", "unixReviewTime": 1367107200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2013"}
