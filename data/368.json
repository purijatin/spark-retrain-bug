I'm using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS (CyanogenMod) booting off a micro SD, there's no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware, it also has Bluetooth, the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer, and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PC's USB, normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is B&N;'s app store, the apps are fairly pricey, apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for, there are a few free apps from B&N; but not many. With the aftermarket firmware I'm using the Amazon app market, much better selection and prices.Cons: The sound is about what I expected, fairly poor, but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove, it's located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner, it's well protected there, just not easy to access. Don't expect to watch streamed HD video, however, sites like YouTube work fine.Despite the cons, I give 5 stars, I think it's a great value, I have been very pleased with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than expected.", "unixReviewTime": 1321660800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2011"}
