I had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources (like Zune, IPod), but that does not appear to be the case.  Since you can always lower the volume on the source (mp3 player, etc.), I'm having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Won't boost volume", "unixReviewTime": 1207440000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2008"}
