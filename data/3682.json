I have read some reviews about the sound quality being bad when you turn it down low. Honestly, if your turning your music down that low then your obviously tyring to pay attention to other things. I tried my headphones with the controller on and off and i don't hear a difference. It is a delicate thing. Very light. My ONLY complaint is that I wish the volume control wheel was a little longer but it is something I can easily deal with. I will update in a few months or if something happens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First day review. Love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1393545600, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2014"}
