When the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible, there was lots of crackling and distortion. Upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings, the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncated/clipped. Depending on what it's connected to, it's good for slightly controlling the volume; however, look into using an amp, instead, for maximum volume control.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent for slightly controlling volume", "unixReviewTime": 1323907200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011"}
