Using this volume control, I can turn up the volume on the Dell to overpower the static while keeping the volume of the music in my ears low.The control is even less sexy than the picture on the website, if that's possible. It also doesn't work great for an extremely loud source (like my Dell port replicator's line out port), because the sound from the volume control doesn't seem to be output equally in both ears at low levels.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does what it says, although balance seems off at extremely low levels", "unixReviewTime": 1242950400, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2009"}
