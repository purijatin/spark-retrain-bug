Two on the earplugs, and two on a seperate controls like the Koss VC20. This is deffinately the easiest access volume control I have used. You do not have to search to find the volume control. It is a simple roll knob that is easy to find. Note, that if you care, this is not an L shaped plug as shown in the product image. I might mention, I am not that concerned about high quality. I only use the mine to listen to audio books, which this seems to be fine for so far. But will get some tough use. I broke the last two earphones (quite expensive ones)at the plug, and decided breaking a volume control would be cheaper. I broke that as well. I thought I would try an \"L\" plug connection. I failed to notice the photo of the notes from Deepanker at the top which shows this is a straight line plug. I will see how this one goes.Koss VC20 Volume Control", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good volume control access - Not an L plug", "unixReviewTime": 1323302400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2011"}
