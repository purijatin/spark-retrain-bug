The adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely.  The wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage.  The cord is perhaps thinner than I would have expected but should be ok.  The body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough.  If the product proves to be durable I will change my rating to a 5....  I recently updated the review to a 5 star rating.  I have had no issues with this adapter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works As It Should", "unixReviewTime": 1199750400, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2008"}
