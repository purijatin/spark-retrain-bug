I primarily used it to make my headphones at the time longer so I could lay down in bed and watch tv.  It did not affect the volume or quality.  I also used it to make my earbuds longer while I was on the go, I primarily use public transportation, so I could put my mp3 player in my bag and simply use the volume control as needed since I would clip that part to my pants or my bag.I plan on getting a replacement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great idea!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1376352000, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2013"}
