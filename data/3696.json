The Koss volume control does exactly what it's supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily. I didn't notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged in-line with the headphones. If you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit. My wife absolutely loves the convenience but I've concluded I could just as easily live without it.Should you buy it? Just answer three questions and you'll have your final answer. 1) Would you prefer a little extra cord length? 2) In everyday headphone use, do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume? 3) Do you have the extra cash to burn?My wife answered yes to all three while I answered no. Did we keep it? You know what they say, happy wife, happy life. :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handy Gadget, 3 Easy questions to make your decision.", "unixReviewTime": 1238371200, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2009"}
