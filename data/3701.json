The soundcard was putting out to much power, turning the volume up to 10 out of 100 on the PC would almost blow the speakers.  This thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the PC volume.  I haven't noticed any sound quality loss though I dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Fine", "unixReviewTime": 1179187200, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2007"}
