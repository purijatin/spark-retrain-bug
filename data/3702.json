As a wearable, it has a clip (like on a pen) so you can attach it to a pocket, sleeve or collar so it won't be flopping around like a cord mounted control.  In my case I used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds I wear while watching TV.The volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any setting.My only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger. That's probably a plus if you're wearing it as it's less likely to be moved by just brushing against it.It's well worth the price and I would buy it again", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nicely designed unit", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}
