The plug is straight, not L shaped as shown in the current picture. The cord is 36 inches. I use this with my MP3 player because I'm trying to minimize wear and tear on my old player and I don't like my panasonic headphone volume control slider thing. I didn't want the thin metal pocket/belt clip, but fortunately I was able to pull it off with some thin pliers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "No L plug like current picture", "unixReviewTime": 1324857600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2011"}
