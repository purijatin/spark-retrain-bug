We have a 5.1 speaker system, controlled by one speaker volume knob (no remote control). It's wired from the TV to a 1/8\" Y/duplex plug; one line continues to the speakers, the other goes to the headphones. Turn the speakers down all the way, and you only hear it through the headphones. Ok so far.But, guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway, with the headphones plugged in, and you change the volume on the headphone using the KOSS Volume Control? The volume of the external speakers changes! Huh? How is that possible? It was odd at first, but if you lowered the KOSS unit's volume, the speaker's volume went up. Raise the KOSS volume, the speaker's volume went down. It's something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5.1 speakers. I had to add a label \"Loud\" and \"Soft\", mounted just the opposite of the Low-to-High volume legend near the control wheel, since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you'd think.So the KOSS Volume Control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well, provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers. Who knew?p.s. I like it so much, I'm buying another.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Another interesting use: external speaker volume control", "unixReviewTime": 1345075200, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2012"}
