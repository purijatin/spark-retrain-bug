Kravetz", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This review is for the Koss Volume Control only.A volume control that I can reach anytime, and it works.A volume control for all devices, and it has the 3.5mm mini-plug. The control includes a clip to attach it to any clothing, too.This is the best separate volume control I have found. I use it with my headphones, and control volume on all my devices with it. It makes changing the volume very easy. Mine did come with a straight plug on the end, instead of the angled plug as shown in the image.This volume control worked better than I expected. I can now control the volume on each device I use with the same control. Instead of trying to remember all the volume controls and where they are, I plug this into my headphones and use it with everything. Other than the plug being straight, there were no surprises.Having tried many volume controls, both separate and integrated, I found this one very easy to use. It is much better than most of the controls out there. Set the volume up fairly loud, and then use this to control it as needed. It works great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use, works with all my devices, a single volume control to remember.", "unixReviewTime": 1363564800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2013"}
