It's been ailing for at least 12 of those months. At first, it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However, in my last conversation with B&N;, they told me to take it into a B&N; bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents, I'll tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldn't have hung in nearly as long if it hadn't been for a NOOK game I'm addicted to and can get nowhere else. Time for online-game-rehab, I guess. I will never buy another Nook. As my kids would say, it's a P**** Of S***.Barbara Cox", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOOK Color wins the P**** of S*** sweepstakes", "unixReviewTime": 1383177600, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2013"}
