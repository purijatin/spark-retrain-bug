When my wife & I both want to share a wired connection to an audio source, I don't have to have her continually telling me to turn it down...it's too loud. I bought this for her to turn Her's down while I enjoy it at a level I can hear. Too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection. Sometimes, it's not always &#34;convenient&#34; to used hearing protection. They didn't have those high-tech ear-plugs back in the day and a lot of us older baby-boomers have lost significant hearing as a result.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Different requirements", "unixReviewTime": 1383177600, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2013"}
