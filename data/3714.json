I was considering ordering another headset with inline volume control, but was reluctant to do so because of the quality of my current Pro/4's.  Searched on Amazon and found this Koss VC20 volume control which is the perfect companion to my headset.As one of the other reviewers rightly stated, this device in not an amplifier.  Therefore please note the following:  one has to turn up the sound on the output device (an iMac in my case), connect the VC 20 volume control to this device, connect the headset to the the VC 20 and then adjust the sound to one's liking.  Very simple to do.  This makes for a superb listening experience.  Works on a computer, iPad, iPhone, etc., and can be used if jogging, exercising or just walking.I've been a fan of Koss for years because of the quality of their products.  This volume control carries on their commitment of making quality products.  Very pleased...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb Product", "unixReviewTime": 1396483200, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2014"}
