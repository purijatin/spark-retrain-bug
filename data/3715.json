However, I figured being able to adjust the volume with an analog control would be a nice bonus. And it is!It does it's job and at that it does it simply and wonderfully.(Edit: After a while of use I noticed that it subdues the highs, lows, and even at the highest volume it is slightly quieter than without it. Still a good buy though!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brass Tacks", "unixReviewTime": 1376524800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2013"}
