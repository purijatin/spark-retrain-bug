Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc.  But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket.  Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good control, but access to the wheel could be better", "unixReviewTime": 1316131200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2011"}
