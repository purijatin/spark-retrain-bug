The headphones are VERY loud when plugged directly into the computer when the system volume is any higher than 2%, so having a mechanical limiter like the VC20 is essential.So far I have no real complaints. Initially I was skeptical about the thin dial, but I've grown to like it - it's easy to find by feel in the dark, but difficult to bump accidentally.The plug end is a little skimpy, but since the control will live by my computer I'm not worried about durability.I can't give a scientific opinion about the sound quality - I'm sure there's some quality loss introduced by putting this device between the source and the headphones, but I'm unable to discern a difference. The sound coming from my M50's is still very nice!I wish it had a mute button, but for the price I can't complain. :-)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job well", "unixReviewTime": 1398729600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014"}
