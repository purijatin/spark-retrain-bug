But the brand and style I really like is no longer available.  I discovered this in-line volume control, realized it would work with any standard headphones using a 1/8 inch plug and I couldn't be happier.  If I need extra cord length for my phones, this gives it.  And I will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one.  It's just so much quicker and easier to deal with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'd been looking for this without knowing it.", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}
