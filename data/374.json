You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files, but when you do, this device will shine. Other recommendations are tank hero, and Jet Car, and Jest Car Lite (the Lite version has levels that the full version does not even have!).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing Andriod Tablet!", "unixReviewTime": 1316304000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2011"}
