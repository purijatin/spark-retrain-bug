The hiss could be heard easily when I was playing mp3 files regardless of which pair of earbuds I used.  I inserted my earbud plug into the the Koss VC20 and then plugged the VC20 into my phone.  After turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the VC20 down, I was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible.  I noticed no degradation in sound quality (same bass and treble levels, for example) when using the VC20 versus not using it. The gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume.  Well worth the price!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Removes hissing sound from HTC phone", "unixReviewTime": 1366502400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2013"}
