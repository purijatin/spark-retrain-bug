My Android has a bug where the media volume resets to max anytime a notification sounds.  This lets me set the media to max and then turn it down to comfortable.  I have very good earphones, and haven't noticed any sound issues.  The cord is flimsy feeling and quite long, so I've just kept it tied in a bundle.
