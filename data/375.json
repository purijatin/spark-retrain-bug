Its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is  sure not a tablet, you cant get free apps, if you want an app from your tv station, guess what, if BN isnt selling it you cant  get it, thats why they sell these things , so you have to buy from them. I found free ebooks on the web, and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook. [...] is very good. The  pages change size of their own freewill, which is very annoying, and the battery life is awful, if you use wifi you have to recharge every day. Yahoo mail is awful on the nook, gmail is fine and hotmail is too. As far as the web, email is all it good for. I wish I had bought and Archos tablet, all the things I am doing now plus a lot more.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "archos would be better", "unixReviewTime": 1309132800, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2011"}
