That is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down. All the clarity / treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound. I tried it with brand new Koss UR40 headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a TDK dual tape deck. By themselves, the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud. Add the VC20 and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control TOTALLY USELESS. If you need a volume control for headphones DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. Either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control, such as the Koss UR29.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Clarity Eliminator", "unixReviewTime": 1234915200, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2009"}
