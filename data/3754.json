Feira", "helpful": [78, 80], "reviewtext": "This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very functional", "unixReviewTime": 973814400, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2000"}
