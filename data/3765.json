Control wheel in cavity of housing, so vol. control won't get accidently turned, and it stays where you set it. Good volume range easy to set to right level. Cord a bit long, when adding to my already long earphones cord, but I just coil up the volume control extra ! Good 1/8\" plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord. Getting another for my Koss headphones. Clip on it, to affix to like a belt.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best vol. control @ Amazon", "unixReviewTime": 1386374400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2013"}
