Instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks.  The sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remote's volume controls (I guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system, which is not what I wanted to do.)  So I heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing I needed to boost volume.  Wrong.  It has no power source, so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume, it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the TV output jacks.  All it can do in reality is turn the sound down.  Skip it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Does not turn sound up; only turns sound down", "unixReviewTime": 1212192000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2008"}
