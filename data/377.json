From me, it gets a solid 4 stars. The problem is that as an eReader, it's already overpriced, and the Amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts. It's cheaper (and ships free) from Barnes and Noble. Amazon is usually #1 at everything, including price, and I already own two Kindles (I would buy the Kindle in color if it came that way) but the price being charged for the NOOKColor on Amazon is absurd.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Awesome eReader, Ridiculously Priced from this seller", "unixReviewTime": 1295913600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2011"}
