For its purpose it is fine.I am not an audiophile so I cannot comment on how good or bad the sound is. Seems fine to me but I have bad hearing anyway. The one I got did not have a curved jack as pictured but rather a straight one, no problem. I use this on my laptop and I have noticed that if I want to reach the louder setting I first have to turn my laptop up to one of the higher settings and then I can go up or down with the Koss. Overall I think it was a good purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a nice device", "unixReviewTime": 1264377600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2010"}
