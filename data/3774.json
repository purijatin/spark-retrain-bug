Cord and jack look a little spindly compared to everything else I have, but so far so good. Very small and light, making it highly portable if you need it to be. About 30\" of reach. I've only had this for a week or so; well worth the $7 as long as it survives a respectable lifespan.UPDATEI can't remember how long I got out of this, but it wasn't long enough (a few months). I really like inline volume controls, but will choose a different one next time. This unit got touchy and created buzzing. Look for something with better quality cable/shielding.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Got a few months out of it", "unixReviewTime": 1329350400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2012"}
