The volume control is good, there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume. I'm rather picky with audio and I haven't had any issues, there is no interference or sound distortion that I can tell. I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good quality", "unixReviewTime": 1357516800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2013"}
