First off,the volume control \"know\" is so inset and tiny that I couln't even identify it at first for about 20 mminutes. It's difficult to \"thumbnail\" this volume control to raise and lower the volume. Also, I was unable to mute out the sound.I felt that the range of volume was inferior that it afforded me the opportunity to listen to. I DID follow instructions about where to put the sources volume (such as mid to just above middle range).", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "How can this item even be sold to the public?", "unixReviewTime": 1346544000, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2012"}
