There is no noise sound when I adjust volume. I can't distinguish whether I plug my headphone with this Koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all. I use HD555 which has 50 ohms impedance so I think this Koss may reduce some power of my headphone. But not at all. My HD555 still provides great sound. I love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice volume control", "unixReviewTime": 1180137600, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2007"}
