I sit at the computer a bit from time to time, and like to stream music.The cord is long enough, about 3ft I believe.  The volume control is just that, basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out, but it means I can adjust it, rather than adjusting the volume on the computer.It does everything it is supposed to, and in a small package.  Worth the purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for what it is, and what I needed", "unixReviewTime": 1354492800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2012"}
