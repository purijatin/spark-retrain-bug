I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very cool mp3 player accessory", "unixReviewTime": 1268092800, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2010"}
