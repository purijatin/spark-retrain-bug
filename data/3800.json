As a result, unless I have it above a certain level, I only get sound at the appropriate sound level from one channel.  If I increase the volume, then both channels sound fine.  So that is slightly irritating, but other than that, works well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent Product", "unixReviewTime": 1249257600, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2009"}
