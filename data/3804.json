Fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output, complete with volume control on the TV remote, so I don't need to replace this in-line volume control.Nothing wrong with the product, but it wasn't sturdy enough to really last - and nothing else I've tried was either. The designers apparently have never lived with their own products. If they listen to music or TV at all they probably don't use earphones.Review by Tony. We both use Plant Lady's Amazon account these days.
