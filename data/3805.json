This Koss VC20 was perfect and I also got the added convenience of a volume control. However, at $8.99 (what I paid at the time) they are pricey for what they do. These days you can pretty much buy a cassette/CD walkman for that price!Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Convenient but pricey", "unixReviewTime": 1217376000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2008"}
