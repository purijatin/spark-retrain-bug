I bought a set of Klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control. Having the inline control is a must for me because I wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club I belong to. So with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs I need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when  someone is trying to talk to me. They work well and I cannot hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It does what it says", "unixReviewTime": 1388016000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2013"}
