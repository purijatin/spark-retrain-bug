The output from the TV is fixed so I needed to have a volume control in line so I could turn down the volume on the TV so I could watch and leave the room quite. This control gave me a couple more feet of length and it works flawlessly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I'm using the same headphones I use with my iPod.Addendum: I've had my volume control for a year now; and it continues to work very well. I use it everyday, and I've had no problems with it. I saw one reviewer that complained it was hard to use; I can't imagine how that could be. The control wheel is recessed into the unit, but is easy to use by just sliding your thumb over the wheel. I've found it to be very robust; once it attached to the end of my headphones the unit reaches to floor; but it's well made, and has taken a beating with any problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1323302400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2011"}
