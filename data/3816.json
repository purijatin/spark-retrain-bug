A true audiophile might have some issue with it, but for general use, this works like a charm.  I use one between my computer and my headphones, and it sounds great on games and music alike.  I also use one between my earbuds and mp3 player, again, I cannot complain.  Very cost effective and hard to find something better.  Note, this will NOT amplify the sound beyond the volume of the source, but can control it within the range of the signal being sent.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice little item to extend and control volume...", "unixReviewTime": 1261785600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2009"}
