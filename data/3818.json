Eisenberg \"Keeping it real since 1959\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "While not the use most likely intended for this Koss device, I purchased it for my mom so she could control the sound from her TV whether to a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker in her lap. It's perfect, and allows her to keep her own personal volume while not having the TV set itself so loud as to blast out the rest of the room. I have also tried it on my iPod, and it's a much more convenient way to trim the volume than fumbling for the touch screen or wheel. I believe the claims on the box to &#34;boost the volume&#34; of your personal device may be less than accurate, at least in my case, but it certainly works well enough for the obvious purpose.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1397347200, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2014"}
