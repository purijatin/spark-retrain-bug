Firmware Update to Android Froyo 2.1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3). Responsive touch screen during reading4). Good, sturdy construction5). Exapandable memory with MicroSD card slot6). Weight is slightly heavy, but not too bad at all.Cons:1).  Although it can play videos on the internet, videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player.  For example, Amazon.com Instant Video plays .wmv files, which is not a compatible format.  Converting these files to another format is next to impossible, since Amazon.com instant video doesn't support the Nook Color.  Amazon.com, CinemaNow (through Best Buy), and even Itunes movies are all DRM protected and won't run on the Nook Color due to lack of support (trust me, I've tried them all).2).  Not connected to Android app store...Barnes and Noble currently (as of 5/11/11) only has 148 apps in their \"Nook Apps Store\".Overall: B+The Color Nook is a great e-reader with inernet capabilities and limited android Apps.  Although a Android Firmware update was released in May 2011, the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of \"Other-than-internet\" video playback, put the Color Nook down a coulpe of notches in my book.  Overall though, this is an impressive e-reader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Found It's Nook", "unixReviewTime": 1305072000, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2011"}
