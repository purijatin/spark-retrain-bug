Being able to just adjust the volume with the Koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my Ipod or MP3 player to do it.  It also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player.  This works exactly like it is advertised.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1239494400, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2009"}
