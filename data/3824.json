I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control.  The device works perfectly, just as it is supposed to.  The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers.  Overall, I'm totally satisfied with this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does what it should.", "unixReviewTime": 1326153600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2012"}
