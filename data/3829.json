When adjusting the volume control, the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner.  After just a couple of months of use, there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume.  Sometimes rapidly turning the dial from MIN to MAX several times alleviates the problem for a few hours.  This product is good if you're looking for an inexpensive, throw-away solution.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Snap, Crackle, Pop", "unixReviewTime": 1233014400, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2009"}
