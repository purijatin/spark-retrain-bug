Add that to the 3 foot cord from my headset and I am dragging around 6 foot of cord.  I have quit using it because I catch it on so many things.  I will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset.  It would have been nice if the cord was removable. I don't really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my JVC headset is turning out to be a challenge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like it BUT", "unixReviewTime": 1302825600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2011"}
