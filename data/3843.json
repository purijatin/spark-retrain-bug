Garfield", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "My niece who lives with me loves to play video games, but we have wood floor throughout the house. This causes the noise from the video games to echo throughout the house. So I bought a RCA to 3.5 mm cable and hooked up headphones not realizing that I needed something to control the volume with. This is where this KOSS VC20 volume control comes into play it worked wonders for my TV (which is older and did have the RCA AUDIO OUT).One thing to note is most of the modern TV do NOT have an RCA audio out instead they have Digital Optical Audio Toslink output. This means you would have to get an adapter that takes the signal from Analog to Digital and back.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works as it is suppose to", "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012"}
