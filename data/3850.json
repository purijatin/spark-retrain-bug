It can only decrease volume and cannot increase the volume from your device.  This is a very simple device that acts as a throttle on the volume provided by the output of your device.  It connects to the output of your device (an earphone jack) and then provides a connection for earphones or speakers.  Once the connection is made the in-line rheostat can reduce the volume.It does that very well and does not seem to add any static.  The controller operates smoothly up and down.  I use this between my laptop and an amplified set of speakers.  I set my laptop to 70% output and the amplifier to 70% which turns out to be very loud with the controller in the max position.  I then use the controller to reduce and increase volume without having to touch the laptop or the amplifier.when connected to my phone, I set the volume to high and reduce it as needed with the controller.  It saves having to activate the screen and taking the phone in and out of my pocket.  It is very handy and the extra cord length is handy for short corded earphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Quality Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1382745600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2013"}
