It turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones. Someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence. I didn't expect it to work but it does. The Koss VC20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable. I am completely satisfied.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A solution to a problem", "unixReviewTime": 1199059200, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2007"}
