It will simply control the volume - that's it.  Now that I've said this, let's move on.I love this little device.  It works great with my Samsung S3 and Poweramp app. Sometimes I get tired of taking my Samsung in an out of my pocket just to adjust the volume - as there are some songs a bit louder than others like there are some commercials on tv that are louder than others. Well, I don't have to do that any longer. I have the Koss Volume Control clipped on the wire part of my Sony headphones and I'm good to go. I owned one before but I must have lost it during relocating and I was really missing it.(I will update this review if any problems arise from this device).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice little device.", "unixReviewTime": 1364083200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2013"}
