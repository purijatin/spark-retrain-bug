Unfortunately the bag, though of very nice material, was not at all big enough to enable me to store the phones in it. The whole experience of trying to fit the collapsed phones into the bag was quite frustrating and I'm surprised that an otherwise good sounding pair as these were (but not great) would be matched with such an unsatisfactory bag as far as size is concerned. However, I did lol use the bag for other things and was very happy with the bag in this case.I found the sound quality not up to the past reviews which gave the PortaPros such a great reputation though.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "somewhat disappointing sound quality and storage bag", "unixReviewTime": 1378512000, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2013"}
