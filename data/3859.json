It made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with KOSS headphones.  I can't say enough about these lightweight, gorgeous-sounding, funky headphones.  PortaPros have a lifetime warranty, look like something out of Tron, and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction.  Buy 'em, and find something else to worry about, in life.  Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Only Headphones You'll Ever Have to Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1287273600, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2010"}
