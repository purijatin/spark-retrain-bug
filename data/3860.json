I'm no audiophile - just a gym rat who uses them every day to drive my workouts.Considering the class of headphones under $50 that I have used, for this one:The Good features:  great sound, light on head, excellent bang for the buck.The Bad features:  I carry them in my gym bag along with my other stuff. The cord gets tangled up half the time.  Also, after some time (1-2 years) the ear cushions become shredded, and must be replaced.June 22, 2012 update.  I have purchased another pair, and I'm very impressed. (New headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal.)  The cord seems shorter, and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled. Also the ear muffins appear larger.  For the price, I know of nothing that's better.  A great buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good value, but a Bit Flimsy", "unixReviewTime": 1264809600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2010"}
