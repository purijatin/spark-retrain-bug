They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.They are worth every penny!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1308700800, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2011"}
