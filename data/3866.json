It's good all-around for every type of music. Clean high and solid low. If you listen mainly to hip hop where booming bass is important, you might want to check out other makes. I listen to all types of music, so this is a good all-around headset for this purpose.It does look a little dorky, but sound quality is more important to me than looks. The headband does pinch your hair occasionally, if you're not careful adjusting it. Mine did not come with a case. It came with a soft pouch instead, so not a whole lot of protection there for traveling purposes. Even in the folding position, it's not easy to get it in the pouch. The sound does leak (enough to bother my wife as she's lying next to me in bed). The ear foams feel a little weak and may wear out quickly after frequent use. Don't know if you can buy the foam separately. I gave it 4 stars mainly for sound quality and price ($30-$40). I've had mine for about 2.5 years now and they still sound just as good as the various $100 plus headsets I recently listened to at the local Best Buy store.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best bang for the buck", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012"}
