However they were never really very suitable for jogging or biking in (not a tight enough fit and will come loose during excessive movement).The bud type earphones just don't cut it for me - uncomfortable and sound quality just crappy. I wonder why most other people are happy to wear bud type phones? Maybe my ears are deformed...Anyways, I googled the web and found several good review's of these koss phones for running.I bought a pair a couple of months ago and I must say that it's one of the best buys I have ever made.The sound quality of the Koss Portapro is excellent and slightly better than my Sennheiser PX 100's. They fit very snugly and feel very light when running and that plus the excellent sound quality make them a great buy.One feels very happy when you have paid a small amount of money for great quality and great sound.Now when I'm sitting at my pc and need phones for listening it becomes a bit more of a toss up. The Koss sound quality is great and with a snug fit. The Sennheiser PX 100 although not quite as good sound quality have a very light feel to them.For walking, running and  general moving around - these Koss phones are the way to go.May 2012 Update:These guys are holding up well despite some pretty rugged treatment - highly recommended", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great sound, great quality and  great for running and biking", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2011"}
