Leonard \"zakool21\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I bought a pair of these while I was in New York - I bought them from one of the big camera/gear brokers there and paid about $35 for them. I bought them because my IEMs are too dangerous to wear on city streets and my AKG K271s are too big to wear out. So, these seemed like a happy medium. They're very durable, they have excellent bass for something this size, and they have a cool retro look. With the lifetime guarantee I'm comforted in the idea of getting them replaced if I should accidentally break them. So far so good though, 6+ months later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Review #999: Fantastic product", "unixReviewTime": 1319932800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2011"}
