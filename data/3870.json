Leung", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I've been using this headphone for a few months.For the build - It looked filmsy, but even I haven't been using it very carefully, it's still working well, no parts broken.For the sound quality, the bass is very good, mid-range is good. I hope the high range could be a bit clearer.  Meanwhile, I found that this headphone is quite musical, no harsh high range, and enjoyable to listen to, especially for piano music, easy listening, and jazz music.  Still the high range could be a bit improved; but, at this price range, it's very okay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good to Excellent for this price", "unixReviewTime": 1297728000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2011"}
