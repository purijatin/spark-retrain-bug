I find myself pulling them off and switching to my over the ear koss headphones because they don't feel like they're crushing my skull.Also, the cord is by far the WORST part about his set. The cable itself is a little too short for my tastes, about 4 feet. This means I feel tethered to my laptop often. But more importantly is the quality of the cord. The cord itself feels like a wire stuck in a narrow sheet of plastic. The reason that is important is because the wire holds its shape any time its folded or bent. This means that the pretty cool looking pair of headphones now have a cord is sometimes so bent out of shape that it rides up in my face.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A few gripes but good headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}
