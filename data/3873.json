I've owned many pairs but Koss has a no questions return policy, one time even sending me a new pair because I inquired about replacement ear pads. The sound that these cans put out are second to none. I flirted with Grado's and other expensive headphones but always run back to these. The look is very 80's retro because they are unchanged (by popular demand) since their introduction and they bring warm deep sound to anything you plug them into. Ear buds are for idiots. Step up to a pair of these babies and you'll be stoked at the sound they put out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Flawless", "unixReviewTime": 1249948800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2009"}
