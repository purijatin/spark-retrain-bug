They still work, and more important, sound fantastic! I've replaced the ear pads due to age, but that's it.What stands out about these today, just as it did back in the early 1980s is the true high fidelity sound quality - including true extended bass. From low bass through the highest treble, these are well balanced and natural sounding. More money will buy a headphone that excels in one area, but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there. To add more transparency to the musical reproduction is going to just plain cost you - and they will be a larger set.In closing, I misplaced my pair (since found) and spent $50 on a pair of well respected affordable AKGs. These sound better.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These have truly stood the test of time!", "unixReviewTime": 1224633600, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2008"}
