All friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the iPods are just amazed when they listen through this!- Comfort! You just don't feel them on your head after some time.- Lifetime Warranty! I bought them at Amazon in 2004. Was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly, and all the foams were gone. I got them repaired absolutely free (just paying the shipping costs), and that too in India! They are like new now.- Price! Bought them for $35 at amazon.- Portability is decent. They fold and don't take much space.CONS- Sound leaks. I use them at office, and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume- Looks, as others have said, they definitely look awkward.Overall, unless you want earbuds/noise cancelling phones/audiophile quality, you cannot go wrong with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1214870400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2008"}
