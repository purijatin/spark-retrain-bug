The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $9.00 shipping and handling. I stood up and literally tore the cables out. In my own defense, they're not secured in tightly. I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they're stylish and the sound is really great. They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation; and, they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Holy mother of price hike!", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2011"}
