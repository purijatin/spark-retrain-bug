I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.  The kindle fire was both thick & too heavy.  On the kindle fire's screen, I had to fight & tap several times to change screens. I grew frusrtated, took the kindle back to Best Buy the same day, and exchanged it for the Nook.  I'm so glad I did.  On the nook, changing screens only requires a smooth tap.  In summary, unless you need a tablet for business purposes, the Nook ereader tablet is your perfect companion when traveling.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect e-reader, web browser, and video player", "unixReviewTime": 1330214400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2012"}
