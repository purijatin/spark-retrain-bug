All headphones require a \"burn-in\" period before they sound their best, and that's certainly true of the Koss Porta-Pro.After burn-in, they show themselves to be equal to their reputation. Retailing between $30 and $40 or so, they offer good fidelity at low to medium volume, but grate a bit when pushed too hard. The Porta-Pro works nicely with a variety of musical styles, pop and rock to jazz, but occasionally has trouble with the distortion levels of punk; this may not be a problem with most listeners.While the sound is clear and offers fine fidelity, songs often lack \"color\" -- a common complaint with less expensive headphones. Yet, compared to its competition, the Porta-Pro offers a much cleaner sound; no irritating bass thump on these phones.These are the iPod phones of choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good phones...for the price, anyway", "unixReviewTime": 1105747200, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2005"}
