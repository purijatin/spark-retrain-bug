Cohen", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I've had my PortaPros for several years now, and they've served me very, very well.Pros:- Best sound I've heard in a small portable headphone. (My Grado SR-80s sound better, but there's no way you'd walk down the street in 'em)- Fold reasonably well into a coat-pocketable clump- Durable as heck (other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers).  I use the heck out of these, and they take it in stride.Cons:- Look pretty un-cool.- Foam earpiece covers need replacing every 50 or so uses - cheap and readily-available from Koss, takes a minute to do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awkward-Looking, But Great Sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1112486400, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2005"}
