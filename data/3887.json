Bass booms and highs sound clear.-Much more comfortable than in-canal buds (this may be more of a personal choice).-Stylish but not too garish.The bad:-My hair gets caught in the adjustable band sometimes.-Feels little bit loose on my head, even when it's secure.Also, this is more of a peeve, but the included \"carrying case\" is really just terrible. It's very hard to fit the headphones in there, even when they are folded as small as they can possibly be. You can tell Koss really cheaped out on the material for the bag, it's just too small.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value", "unixReviewTime": 1299024000, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2011"}
