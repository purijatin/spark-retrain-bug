They're a good compromise between tiny portable earphones and full-size home headphones. They sound good and are apparently durable, as I've been using the same pair for all these years. My only reservation is that the foam earpads tend to get damaged when you toss them in a bag with other items, so use the case. I don't remember if mine came with one. Also, consider buying the replacement earpads. I've worn a couple pair out and damaged a couple pair.It's possible that those in-ear earphones have caught up in sound quality, so consider those. I'm not in a hurry to replace my Porta Pros, though.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still good after 22 years", "unixReviewTime": 1288915200, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2010"}
