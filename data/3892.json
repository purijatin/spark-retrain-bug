Amazing sound quality that matches my studio headphones, with a durable 'on-the-go' construction.  Base is solid, highs are not peaky or harsh on the ears, and the mids are smooth and warm sounding.Very comfortable on the ears.My original pair stopped working, and I sent them to Koss and for $10 I had a brand new pair sent to me within 2 weeks!!Only complaint is that the way the metal band is designed with two pieces it can pinch your neck hair when sitting around your neck instead of on your head.  Minor complaint but it hurts!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}
