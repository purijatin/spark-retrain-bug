I have a collection of over ear, on ear, and in-ear phones and developed some critical listening ability and in my experience the Koss sound good. I'm not going to discuss all the genres for the sake of time, but they did sound good for classical and rock and EDM. The retrodesign is fine, but the mechanics of leaves me wary. It does catch my hair on a consistent basis, and despite the pressure settings over the ear, they somehow cause discomfort within an hour. I'm thinking that a relatively small percentage of people would share that experience. I do like the folding mechanism and the life time warranty! Nice. Yes, people say you get a lot for the money, but unless these are your only phones, I'd likely be reaching out for my 'other' phones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Going against the masses", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2013"}
