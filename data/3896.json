Kind of a cult following of audiophiles, fashion lovers, and retro freaks back then and now. Great punch and bass for a small and simple headphone.  Very good price from Amazon for $30ish vs. Msrp $50 or even higher for limited edition colors or cable volume control.  Great alternative to ear buds or full cans, somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so I would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage. Obviously not closed so neighbors will hear your music at louder volumes. However this isn't a problem in louder public venues like the bus, subway, airport, train stn,etc.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lots of bass, reasonable price, old school style", "unixReviewTime": 1358640000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2013"}
