Its can fold up into a small package like a mini transformer, its comfortable  (i never got hair stuck - unlike my akgs) and the sound is amazing. Bass is strong, the mids are pretty good. Its very good for current day music. It is very energy efficient - can set your iphone at halfway and still get good sound.I wouldn't recommend it if your musical set is acoustics or other lighter genre however still much better than say stock buds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "koss porta pro - perfect portable can", "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012"}
