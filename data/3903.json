But I irrationally felt from their appearance that they probably weren't as good as so many people said they were. But indeed they are. As everyone discovers, the experience of comfort and sound clarity in these matters can be extremely personal. On the basis of sheer discomfort alone, I have greatly disliked every one of all the types of headphones I have ever tried- until now. And anything in-ear is much worse. So I have simply been looking for something/anything with decent sound quality that didn't cause my ears to burn and my entire head to ache after 30 minutes. Now the long frustrating quest merely to find wearable headphones is over at last. What a relief!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "At Long Last", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2013"}
