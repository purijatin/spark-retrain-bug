I have been using them for years and occasionally need to replace them. $50 at almost any store that sells them, I found them on Amazon for $35.I've tried many other brands over the years and many price ranges, including the noise canceling Bose ones (they hurt my ears.)Nothing comes close.My son destroyed the pair I bought here a few years ago so he's not touching these :-)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best", "unixReviewTime": 1240272000, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2009"}
