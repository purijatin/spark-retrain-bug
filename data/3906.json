I have read that they have amazing sound and you can't find a better sound for the money. Man were the reviewers right! The sound-stage is amazing, with great highs and bass. The bass is delivered so well, I can't find words other than impressive and intense, especially for the size of these headphones. I must say, they get better sound than headphones that range up to $120 and even more easily. I listen to a lot of 60's to 80's rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully. A 3D type of Sound. Also try the Koss KSC-75's for an even better performance.Pro's1) Price is unbeatable2) Great balance of high's, mid's and low's3) Ground breaking bass4) Great Sound-stage (Separation of instruments)5) A 3D sound6) Cool 80's design7) Sound doesn't need to be amplified (It shouldn't be either)Con's1) Gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while (1 hour or so)2) Seems flimsy at times3) Although it seems to be made of good material, the case/bag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out of.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Be$t Headphone$ for the $$$$$!", "unixReviewTime": 1357430400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2013"}
