Normally the only thing I care about with headphones is how durable they are, though ever since I became an adult, and my head got bigger, I suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into consideration!I used to have REALLY horrible luck with headphones back in the 90's.  The headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so I'd have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back.  It was annoying.  This problem still exists from time to time, but these particular type of Koss headphones haven't been giving me this particular problem and I'm VERY happy about that.  Nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on, and BAM- the volume drops out from one side.I highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1326758400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2012"}
