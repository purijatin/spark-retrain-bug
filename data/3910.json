I'm not sure why they're so retro looking, but they're really comfortable and sound like high end headphones without being giant monsters... the sound quality and the bass and volume levels are amazing.Don't question yourself... buy these and try them out and you'll be extremely happy that you did!!!!Updated: 2011....  Wow, I can't believe I bought these in 2003!  The earpads, after almost 8 years, need replacement.  That's it.  They still sound amazing when I put them on and they make music oh so enjoyable compared to earbuds... not even $500 earbuds sound as good as these little $30ish 1970s looking headphones... and they're now actually just retro enough looking and to me say \"hey, those must sound awesome because they're sorta ugly\" so I wear them proudly. Don't hesitate... plus you have 30 days to try them out, that's why Amazon is so awesome.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Updated Review from 2003!", "unixReviewTime": 1156982400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2006"}
