I couldnt wear these for more than an hour without them hurting my ears, but for the price you could certainly do worse. Honestly though, if your willing to go to in ear headphones, go with the spark plugs, the are better at noise isolating, fit better in your ears, and I really cant notice a diffrence in sound quality + they're like half the price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not as good as other reviewers say", "unixReviewTime": 1278547200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2010"}
