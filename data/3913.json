Following a good deal of research I believe I made the right choice.These Koss PortaPro's are lightweight with an excellent sound, and the unique design makes them very comfortable.  I have tried the Bose $220 headsets - and if you fly alot they're probably worth it for the sound dampening  effect - but if someone makes a better sounding set for less than twice as much - buy it.  For $35 these are well worth the money.U P D A T E: Purchased in January 2008, I've been using these for 4 years now and have been through 3 or 4 sets of earpiece covers. They still sound great!  [One time I thought the bass had gone out on one side as it had an awful rattle, but I cleaned it out - it was a hair against a speaker - and it sounded fine again.  So check for debris before you toss yours out.]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1199318400, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2008"}
