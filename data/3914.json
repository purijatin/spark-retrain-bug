Perfect for portable devices if you don't mind looking a little geeky with it's 80's styling. The next step up would be Grado SR60 or Sony MDR-v6 (which i own) but those are a lot bulkier and more expensive.It has very strong bass for its size. The only thing I would change is a better quality wire that lasts longer. On the plus side, it does have the Koss lifetime warranty (just pay the shipping).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great portable sound while they last.", "unixReviewTime": 1175385600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2007"}
