Its easy to forget that you're wearing these because they're comfortable and adjust well. They don't squeeze on the ears and head like a lot of headphones do but they stay put comfortably. I also like the way the headphones fold into such a small size, they fit in a coat pocket or computer case pocket. While they look like they might be a little frail, they seem to be pretty rugged. I have a few different sets of headphones and these became my instant favorite.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Sound and Value", "unixReviewTime": 1220313600, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2008"}
