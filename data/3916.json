These are my favorite headphones - that's not to say they're the most detailed, accurate, or will fool you into thinking they're a set of Stax or anything (they are, of course, astonishingly accurate and detailed).  No other headphones combine this level of comfort, soundstage, openness, and plain excitement into such a compact, durable, and CHEAP package.  These are tiny tiny tiny, but rock out with authority.There's been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the Sennheiser PX100.  I bought a pair of those Senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans, I guess, but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange.  They're also bland and cold.  Beyond sound, they're not even as comfortable as the PortaPros, as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you're walking around.  Finally, the Senns are not only less durable than the PortaPros, but the warranty is only two years vs.  Koss's incredible NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That's right, you never have to buy a set of headphones again, until you die.  Just incredible.  If you want to demo this sound t a lower price, try out the Koss KSC 75 ear clip model, but be warned they're nowhere near as comfortable.  Buy with confidence.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Just Great Portable Headphones...", "unixReviewTime": 1206662400, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2008"}
