They are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type. The sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too. As far as style goes I've heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking. I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers, not much you can do in the way of \"style\". If you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the SportaPro. For the money these are hard to beat. The sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best sounding portable headphones I've heard", "unixReviewTime": 1346630400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2012"}
