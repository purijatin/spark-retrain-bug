That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Airplane headphones?", "unixReviewTime": 1376352000, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2013"}
