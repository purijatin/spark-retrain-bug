The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Useless for internet", "unixReviewTime": 1322784000, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2011"}
