The verdict? Not bad at all (for the price) but I'm not sure they deserve such high praise.Pros....1. Obviously, they're very affordable and they sound pretty good2. Compact and very portableCons...1. Sound can be a bit muffled at times. Sometimes there's a bit too much bass. This is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you're listening for it at all.2. The touted feature that's supposed to make them more comfortable doesn't seem to do much at all for me.3. The cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours.I'd buy them again if I had a tight budget and needed a set of compact, portable headphones. But I'd think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if I could spend more.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound but maybe just a tad overrated.", "unixReviewTime": 1348617600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2012"}
