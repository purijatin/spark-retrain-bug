This is an average sounding headphone by comparison. nothing to write home about. I got the Sony V6 and those are very good, glad I got those, would like to try the Audio Technica m50 one day. I also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like $5.87, those also suck, the JVC Gumy earbuds sound way better. I think those earbuds represent a good value like the Pinnacle PN8+. I know that's not an earphone but the Gumys really are  that good of a value at 7 bucks. anyways I might give these portapro another chance...probably not though.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "not good, might try again later", "unixReviewTime": 1355616000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2012"}
