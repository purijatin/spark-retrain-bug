I discovered Jazz about two years ago and listen to much Bill Evans and Miles and Tord Gustavsen. I own Grado 225 headphones, NAD CD player, and a nice Yamaha-powered music setup with Paradigm speakers. What's my favorite listening experience? My iPhone with these Koss Porta-Pros! On my second pair now and always keep a spare pair in the study in case I ever lose these Porta-Pros. Bass is fantastic and mids perfect. I would boost the treble a bit to match the purity of my Grados, but nothing can touch the bang-for-buck experience of these Koss 'phones. Greatest experience for rock music. I'm loving them more every day. Not just great portable headphones -- they are amazing headphones, period.
