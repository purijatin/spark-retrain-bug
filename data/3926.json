Then they jumped the price to only a 10% discount. Now, it's a 15% discount.This is a bad business practice and Amazon is doing this more and more. It lessens the ability to purchase a product. I was ready to doit, but not when they suddenly jumped the price. I like the phones but not price jumps when I show interest in something.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Why jump the price?", "unixReviewTime": 1375142400, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2013"}
