These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Just what I'd hoped for", "unixReviewTime": 1307318400, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2011"}
