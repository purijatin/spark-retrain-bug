They were actually a full-size headphone which looked very similar to these. They were lightweight, very comfortable, and had the most amazing clarity.  It seems to me that Koss has simply miniaturized the very same Koss headphones I had years ago. They are lightweight, very comfortable, and retain the same clarity of the larger phones I used to have. These are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock. The highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full, but not overwhelming like the Dre's.  One of the things that I noticed more so than other headphones I've own is the separation of sound. You can distinguish the left and right channel clearly. It totally adds to the listening experience.  My only complaint is, as far as I know, Koss has discontinued the full-size version of this headphone which I used to have.  I would like to see it on the market again, but until then, I am very pleased with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Deja Vu.", "unixReviewTime": 1308614400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2011"}
