Well, they kind of do...They sound great and have audio design by John Bruss.  The sound imaging is pretty amazing and they respond beautifully in their frequency range at all volumes.  I wear them for ~7 hrs per day at work and they're not as fatiguing as earbuds.  The look is VERY 80s, so you def won't have to worry about people stealing your surprisingly awesome headphones.  The headband can grab your hair if you pull them on over your head, so make sure to pull them open before putting them on.They saved money on the industrial design, but spared no expense on the audio quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value.", "unixReviewTime": 1357430400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2013"}
