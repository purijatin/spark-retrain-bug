They have a bit of trouble boosting treble because of this, but they are well balanced for most recordings so it doesn't really matter.Many have complained about the headphones being too tight, but I have a pretty big grape and have no trouble wearing these on a two hour walk.I use these with my awesome Archos JukeBox Recorder 10, and they are a killer combo.  Many MP3 players sacrifice a resonable amp for smaller size, so these Porta Pros will help salvage players with diminutive amps.The only complaint with my Porta Pros is they are open ear, and people are always noticing my music, even though they all admit I'm not listening that loud once they try them on.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Loud  With Great Bass", "unixReviewTime": 1054080000, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2003"}
