Humble", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought these Koss ProPorta headphones after getting tired of the small in-ear headphones. I've had a bunch of them, including Bose and Bang & Olufsen. These are better than any of those. I was just looking for something to use with my computer at work. I don't use them a lot, but am now finding myself using them a lot more than I used to.For what I wanted these for and for the price, not sure how you can beat them. I've also had the high-end Bose noise canceling headphones, but they are so big and bulky that I just don't carry them with me when I travel. Several of the reviews commented on how hard it was to get these into the leather-like storage bag that comes with them. I did not find it a problem at all. They fold up and hook together and easily fit inside the bag. They are super comfortable (my hair is short so the hair pulling isn't an issue). The way they're built, they'll probably last forever or at least until I get tired of them.I wouldn't hesitate a moment to buy these. Hey if you don't like them, you're only out about $30. I'm not a sound expert, so they sound pretty darned good to me and much better than all the small ones I've been using.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Can't beat these for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1258416000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2009"}
