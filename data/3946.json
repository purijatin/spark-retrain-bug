I find these to be a good pair to use with my portable CD player while working at my P.C. I have numerous and sundry headphone, from high end Sennheiser, to junky chepos that I purchased because of my headphone fetish. I even own a couple of the vaunted sound canceling phone.I have always liked Koss products, especially my old PRO 4AAs.
