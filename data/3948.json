I work in a crowded (load) office, and there are days that would be almost unbearable without these headphones. I am able to crank up the volume, and the sound quality is excelent. The bass produced from such a small package is remarkable.I did have to replace one set of the cushions after a few years, and eventualy one of the speaker wires started to short out.
