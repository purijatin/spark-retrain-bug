They get shoved into my bag, ripped out, tossed around, and stuff like that. Other than the time I stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it (but superglue fixed everything!) they're just the same as when I got them last year. I tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didn't have any success. Bass and sound quality is superb. Whenever mine break I'm getting another pair!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1380067200, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2013"}
