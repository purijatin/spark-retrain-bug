Spencer", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I own 1 each of grado sr 80, sennheiser rs 65 and both the koss sportapros and portapros.  The sound you get with the portapro is as rich to me as the grado sr 80.  Its amazing that such a light headphone can produce the same rich highs and deep lows. Accuracy is no problem for the portapros since there is not much material.Between the portapros and sportapros, I think the portas sound better (The sportapro has developed a light distortion with bass, the reason I recently purchased the portapro).  The sportas metal band does not slip as much as the porta but the porta one-ups again with an adjustable \"comfort zone\" setting for the temporal pads. Design-wise, I like the more masculine look of the portas over the sportas and never used the behind-the-ear configuration of the sportas.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best portable.", "unixReviewTime": 1135900800, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2005"}
