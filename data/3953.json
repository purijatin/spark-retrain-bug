Weiser \"Unreliable Coaster\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews I'd read on the internet. I wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldn't break the bank; I will be traveling abroad for a semester, and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not much of an audiophile, but I was very pleased with the PortaPros. They are very comfortable, provide ample bass and overall sound quality, and fold up to make them quite portable to boot (go figure). The included case and 1/4\" audio adapter were nice bonuses. I am using them with an iPod and my laptop, both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros. Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in \"travel mode\" doesn't hold all that well.If you buy them, consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with (Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions). The headphones will last, but the pads might eventually tear (they did on my old Sony headphones).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprisingly good", "unixReviewTime": 1214438400, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2008"}
