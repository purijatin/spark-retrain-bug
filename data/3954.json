WOW!  These cans really pump... the frequency range was something I totally did not expect, especially when monitoring a live electronic music instrument - drums no less!  These headphones handled the pounding drum sounds perfectly and with no fatigue at all.  I was able to also hear other live instruments as well.  The only drawback is the level at which these headphones start to distort out... (now this is a level which I believe is way beyond normal listening levels - remember, this is from a band rehearsal at full volume.)So, during a solo practice session, these did a phenominal job.  However, it is a lot to ask these headphone to be the primary monitor cans during a full blown gig - the sound pressure levels are too much.But, if you're looking for great headphones that are comfortable to where for long periods and sound fantastic, then these are the ones!I highly recommend them!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Use them with my Roland V-Drums TD-10 kit...WOW!", "unixReviewTime": 1265328000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2010"}
