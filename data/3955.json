Get a volume control (also Koss) and you are all set.  Cord is a bit short, but plugged into the volume control you will have plenty of length. These are really excellent sounding phones. I couldn't believe the difference between a couple of other cheap ones I have.  Highly recommended!These have been highly regarded for many years, and I recall having had a pair maybe 15 years ago. Also you may want to buy some replacement foam pads. I use mine outside and they get a lot of sweat on them. Changing pads is a breeze.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "porta pros rule", "unixReviewTime": 1343952000, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2012"}
