I only had to buy this pair because I somehow broke my last pair (had for over 2 years).  The breaking was all my fault; nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car.  Mea culpa!  Seriously though, the audio is the best I've ever heard from non-noise canceling headphones.  I use these on walks and jogs, so I need something that doesn't completely drown out ambient noise.  They do drown out softer noises (much more than earbuds) so be careful!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I've ever owned", "unixReviewTime": 1243468800, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2009"}
