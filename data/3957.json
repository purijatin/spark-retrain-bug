I am not going to bore you..Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod...I own them both...So which one is my preference? The Sennheisers, for one reason only...People use their Ipods in malls and on the go. There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments (say, in a store or when having conversation).With the Sennheisers, I can remove the phones from my ears and let them \"hang\" around my neck in comfort...Try this with the Koss's and they will place a stranglehold on you. For this reason alone, I recommend the Senn's. Both,in my humble opinion, sound equally good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Porta Pro vs Sennheiser 100's", "unixReviewTime": 1193097600, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2007"}
