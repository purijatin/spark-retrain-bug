If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Really? SO OVER HYPED THIS IS CRAP.", "unixReviewTime": 1291766400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2010"}
