After reading rave reviews about their quality and history, I thought these would be great for listening to music and podcasts at the office. For years, I've been wearing a pair of cheapo earbuds (Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones SHS3200/28 (Black) (Replaces SHS3200/37)) that were extremely comfortable and got the job done, but I decided it was time to upgrade to something with better sound. Sound-wise, I honestly wasn't blown away by these. Yes, they offer more bass than most portable headphones, but the bass on these strikes me as muddy and overpowering. In terms of comfort, after several hours of use, my ears started to ache from the pressure of the headband even with the \"Comfort Zone\" switches set to the lightest setting. In contrast, I can wear my $8 Philips earbuds all day with no fatigue or discomfort. This might not be an issue if you're not planning on extended listening sessions (they're fine for an hour or so), but if you're planning on wearing them for longer periods, you're in for a headache.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not comfortable for long periods of use", "unixReviewTime": 1358380800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2013"}
