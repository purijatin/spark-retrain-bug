My son has managed to destroy a pair of these and bunches of others but I digress.  In every way possible these are great headphones. Portable, easy to use, sufficient bass, and fairly priced to boot. If I used an MP-3 player of any kind I'd have a pair of these. Since I'm more a full-range stereo kinda guy, my big boy Sennheisers fill my bill. I have used these headphones on occaision however and can't recommend them more highly.Da Worfster", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "You really can't ask for much more....", "unixReviewTime": 1291161600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2010"}
