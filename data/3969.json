I had tried a bunch in the process looking for headphones in the $150 range, tried Bose OE ($180), Sony XB700 ($90), Pioneer Home Theater A1000 ($95), Sony V700 ($85)... Out of the more expensive headphones I thought the Bose OE sounded the best (very clean crisp highs, and great bass and VERY comfortable).The only headphones that came close to the Bose OE (in terms of sound) were these Koss Portapros and they cost 1/6th the price!! Some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something?? Totally untrue, the headphones feel and look great, are comfortable enough for a good couple hours, and sound amazing!Even if you plan to buy some expensive headphones I really think you should have a pair of these... I actually just ordered a $350 pair of Denon d2000, but I don't regret the Portapros one bit, they are awesome, great bass, good mids and highs (albeit not as good as the Bose, but close enough considering the drastic price difference).Update (after 1 month use): Recently I purchased some Denon d2000 and Beyer Dynamic t990 (both retail over $300) I still can't believe how good the Koss stand up to them. For fun I tried connecting the Koss to my Nuforce uDac-2 HP (amp/dac) and they sound even better; mind you the Denons and Beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the Koss it's worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hi-fi headphones. Still impressed!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "In my opinion COMPARABLE to the Bose OE and beyond...", "unixReviewTime": 1302480000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2011"}
