For the price they are simply amazing.  Great bass response.  Crystal clear highs.  Wonderful for all kinds of music: pop, rock, jazz, classical, soundtracks.  I actively go out and listen to the competition all the time.  I did just order the Sennheister Px 100s because evidently they edge past the Koss headphones.  I find this hard to believe, but we'll see.  I do love the Bose Q2's and plan to get those for home and travel.  But when it comes to serious street bopping: for the Koss.  You will not be sorry!!
