The sound quality is a solid 5 stars.  They have very crisp and accurate sound reproduction, a spacious soundstage, wonderfully controlled low-range response, and mids and highs that are just the right balance of warm and bright sound.  They are clean and not sibilant at all.  The only down side is the design.  They are awkward to adjust and to wear.  They also tend to pull your hair.  The temple pads are a dumb idea on headphones that are so light and not noise-isolating.  They also will not fit into or out of their included soft case without almost destroying them. But for sound quality alone these are absolutely untouchable at anywhere near the price range.When I'm really needing a portable headphone I usually go with the soundmagic e10's.  They aren't quite as nice to listen to as these Koss porta Pros, but they also block out outside noise and are still amazing to listen to.  They absolutely trounce any other earbuds I have listened to for under $70.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound...stupid design", "unixReviewTime": 1391817600, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2014"}
