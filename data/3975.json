They have decent quality (nothing compared to a more expensive brand, but still better than in earbuds), and they are strong.  I have sat on them and squashed them, yet they still stayed together and kept their shape perfectly.  The problem I had with them was the U shape of them would always get caught on other cables and chords and trust me, that is SO frustrating!  Also, they always close automatically so you have to resize them every time you put them on.  Didn't mind either of these things the first few months, then they eventually start getting to you, trust me on this.  Overall, for this price, they are good, durable portable headphones with good sound, but those gripes I have lead me to not recommend them to constant music listeners...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "2 years, still going!", "unixReviewTime": 1380067200, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2013"}
