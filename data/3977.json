I had about 5 minutes to sample the awesomeness before I had to go to work, so I fold them up (neat design, by the way)and fit them into the tight (as in physical, not fashionable) carrying pouch and set them on my dresser.The next day, I have more time to actually use these guys, so I pull them out of the pouch. This is where I need to warn buyers before getting these headphones.THE POUCH IS TOO TIGHT, WHEN YOU PULL THE HEADPHONES OUT, NO MATTER HOW CAREFUL YOU DO IT, ONE OR BOTH OF THE EARPIECES WILL SNAP WHERE IT SWIVELS.[...]UPDATE: NEVER MIND THE WARRANTY IS AMAZING!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Are you kidding me...
