They may just be the best headphones I've ever owned- they're not perfect, but they have proven sturdy, they travel well, and they sound great. No kidding; the only headphones I've used that sounded better were the expensive Bose noise-cancelling sort, so I consider this money well spent.Drawbacks: A little pricey. I bought the first pair for under $25 on a competing site, so you might do better with another vendor. The steel band can be a little uncomfortable, but hasn't been for me.Bottom line, these are a great buy and I look forward to using them for a long, long, long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love 'em.", "unixReviewTime": 1322611200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2011"}
