If there is a short, a problem (and there have been about 4 over the years), they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones, and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling.  I recommend any KOSS headphones not just because the sound is really good, but because they stand behind their product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great product, and a lifetime investment", "unixReviewTime": 1068681600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2003"}
