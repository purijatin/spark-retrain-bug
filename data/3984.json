They're SO UGLY!Needless to say, I stopped worrying about how good they looked as soon as I heard how good they sounded.  They have amazing bass and the highs and mids are clear without getting distorted or drowned out.  The construction seems flimsy, but as others have pointed out, there is a lifetime warranty on these (although you have to pay for S&H;).  They're light on the head and I can wear them for hours without any fatigue.  However, they are a good amount of sound, so I wouldn't recommend listening to them in quiet areas like libraries or on a commute.  All in all though, I hate to sound cliche: but this really is one of the best headphones for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cliche, but it really is one of the best headphones for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1385942400, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2013"}
