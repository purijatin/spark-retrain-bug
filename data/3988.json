I was interested in this because it is in CNET's top 5 and so many good reviews in Amazon. So I don't think one more elaborated review is not necessary but I want to focus on some issues specifically.1)comfort: I bought a sony MDR-XB500 (for it's extreme comfort and good sound quality) after I buying Koss PortaPro thinking that Koss is pressing my ears too hard because, my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours. Afterwards I noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from KOSS. If you listen at little less volume it shouldn't be a problem.2)Mechanical issues: There are glides on the Headphone for light and Firm wear but when I put them in light mode they just don't stay there. They come to firm position once I touch the phones. One more thing, unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse. This is not an annoying problem for me because I have a big head. Slowly my ears are used to this, and I can listen for longer times and I am listening at low sound levels. So I changed my decision to return these and I am keeping them.Just to list the Pros and Cons I experienced.Pros: Best sound quality, light weight, portable, extra bass (you love it),Cons: Design not up to the mark, Mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position. Extra bass (You can hurt your ears).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best bang for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1283644800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2010"}
