Jacques", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Probably not fair to compare these to my last set which were PX100s and cost considerably more, so I won't do that, cause PX100s they're not. That said they are decent enough for the price. I was a bit spectacle on how comfortable they would be since I shave my head and these have no pads, but they fit fine, stay on my head and are comfy enough.They produce decent sound although somewhat muddy and not as crisp as the PX100s for sure. But since they are mainly for the time I spend on the stair master at the gym, the sound quality is more than adequate. They block most of the background noise, but I can still hear a bit of what's going on around me which is not a bad thing.As for portability, they fold up small enough, but not small enough to fit easily in the carry bag that is provided, which is pretty much useless. Without it, it's a pain since I keep them in a pocket of my gym bag and without some sort of small carry bag the cord easily gets tangled. For some reason it wants to maintain the original coiling it had in the packaging. Hopefully over time it will straighten a bit. Not a big deal though and I can make do with some other bag for storing them.How well they hold up is yet to be seen. I'm pretty hard on my headphones and have yet to have a pair last more than two years. They look solid enough but I have my doubts. For the price though, it's not a big deal.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would say the rating on these is about right.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1294790400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2011"}
