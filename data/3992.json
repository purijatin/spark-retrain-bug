They are small, what you would expect from a cheap portable set. However, the sound blows me away. I hear every little nuance of the music. The bass is very present, the highs are crisp and clear. Well done Koss! They are comfortable to wear, easy to get a good fit with minimal adjustments. They do seem fragile, only time will tell. Get a pair, hear for yourself. I'm quite surprised and very happy with mine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sonic Bliss", "unixReviewTime": 1241913600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2009"}
