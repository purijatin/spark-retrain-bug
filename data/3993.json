The sound quality was great. Wonderful bass--the only phones with  better have been phones that fully cover my ears--and aren't really &quot;portable.&quot; These stayed comfortable for the excruciatingly long flights from SoCal to northern Norway, even while wearing glasses. They fold up nice and small, easy to tuck away. They also performed adequately while watching airline movies ... more than saved the price of the phones over several trips!I have two complaints: 1) hair easily penetrates the &quot;speaker grill&quot; and makes irritating noise against the actual speaker membrane. 2) The speaker, while reproducing sound well, can develop tears in the membrane easily. BE CAREFUL! Nothing is more annoying than a buzzing speaker at 33,000 feet (well, perhaps sudden cabin depressurization ...)!My second pair wore out about the same time as my vintage walkman. I replaced the setup with a Nomad II MG &amp; a pair of noise cancelling headphones--they make a _huge_ difference!Five stars for sound quality. Five stars for comfort. Five stars for portability. Five stars for durability. If you're not going to spring for noise cancellation and you need a folding pair of phones, then get a pair of PortaPros.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Travel", "unixReviewTime": 989712000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2001"}
