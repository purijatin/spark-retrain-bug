Loupas", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I own 9 pairs of headphones and several more have been and gone.By far, the PortaPros are my favourite for portable music. Long walks with the dogs, bike riding, train travel, plane travel.The sound these little babies pump out belies their size. Truly excellent acoustics for such a small package.Not many companies these days offer a lifetime guarantee. Says a lot about this product.Some people are unsure of the retro look. I for one love it. They're unique in that regard, but at the end of the day, it's all about the sound and that's where these headphones excel.Do yourself a favour and get some.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "By far the best portables headphones around.", "unixReviewTime": 1260403200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2009"}
