I'm speaking directly to Longevity now.I got Koss PortaPro phones ages ago, I think I got mine in 1998. Seriously: I bought them specifically for listening to FTP- begotten MP3 files before I found Napster.These were the best phones I ever found, for these three reasons:1) They aren't monitors, so I can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name. Ear goggles would not allow that.... When my kids are sleeping, and I need to hear any cries in the night, this is critical. Also I could use them at work.2) They provide excellent response range, and I assessed this in my 20's, when I could still hear over 20MHz.3) And now, I swear to you FOURTEEN YEARS LATER, I'm listening to the same phones, and still loving the sound quality.  I've had to replace the pads, I've long since lost the case, but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when I want good sound quality with my netflix streaming. The metal has not even a blemish.... FWIW, I have not had to replace the temple pads. For some reason those have not deteriorated. I don't get it, logically they should've.Anyway, whenever my kids break these, I will buy another pair, with unreserved exuberance.aside: Koss also OEMs some of the headphones for Radio Shack. I had a much less favorable experience with those phones. You should stick with the brand-name version. Apparently even the Koss factory is capable of producing crap for an OEM job.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Longevity", "unixReviewTime": 1327968000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2012"}
