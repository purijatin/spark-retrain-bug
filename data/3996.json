However, they NEVER retain the tension setting or head band size that you set for best fit between uses (even when not folded) due to design limitations.  They also tend to become uncomfortable to wear after a short period of time at any setting.  If you do NOT need portability as your overriding choice factor, you can do MUCH better with other Koss headphone models or other top rated brands... so keep looking.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Portable But Not Comprtable", "unixReviewTime": 1276992000, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2010"}
