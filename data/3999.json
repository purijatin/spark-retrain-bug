Williams", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I've been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under $100. That might not be correct, though... You may have to go up to $250 to find cans as good as these. For the price, they simply cannot be beat. They are light, super-comfortable, and they sound great. The only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently, the cord *will* break. It's not even a matter of \"if\", it's a matter of \"when\". I've gone through 4 or so pairs of these things. They're cheap though, so it doesn't bother me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best headphone under $100", "unixReviewTime": 1330646400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2012"}
