Great sound, cheap, lifetime warranty.As an example: I sometimes use these when I edit movies, while others usually wear these really big and expensive ones from Sennheiser or Sony. One day some guy came over and almost laughed at me for using such small head phones, so I let him give it a try, and he was really impressed.The sound is nice and crispy, plays low mid and high tones equally well. I listen to black and death metal and these work really well for that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best head phones out there", "unixReviewTime": 1353024000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012"}
