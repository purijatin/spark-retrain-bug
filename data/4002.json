I've had a pair of these Koss PortaPro headphones for several months now, and used them on PCs for games and on an iPhone and an iPad for games, music and video.  These headhones have great sound with all the devices.  I like them so well that I just ordered 2 more pair.  It would be hard to beat them for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones, great price", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012"}
