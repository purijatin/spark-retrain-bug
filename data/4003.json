They do not have the best high range, but decent.  Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style.  They performed so well, that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his.  When I called him out on the retro style, he shrugged and said &#34;have you heard these?&#34;  Enough said!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "amazong sound for price", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}
