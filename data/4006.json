They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1139443200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2006"}
