I needed a pair of headphones to replace a pair of old sony MDR 20s...similar to sony v100s.Ok the speaker diaphrams on the Koss Porta Pros are very good.The problems I have with the Koss porta pros is the comfort.  The ear pads are smaller than most peoples ears. So the ear pads rest on the inner ridges of your ears, combine this with a spring headband that naturally wants to curl up will provide just enough tension to irritate your ears within 2 hours.The position locks on the sides of the headband do not LOCK in any way, you pick up the headphones with one hand and the earpieces flip to the inside of the headband.The cable is a little short and quite flimsy.Summary...sound good but not too comfortable.BETTER Choice  Sennheiser HD 201...full cup, great sound $20", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sound...so so comfort", "unixReviewTime": 1265241600, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2010"}
