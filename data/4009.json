Travel Durability: Abysmal. Like, I went on one trip and one of the earpieces broke off at the cheap plastic pins that hold it on to the frame. I had a pair of Sony's that I owned for three years and went on twenty trips with no problem. Eventually the cord got frayed and I had to replace it with this piece of garbage. Maybe I just had bad luck. Probably not though. On my flight back, sitting between fat hick who decided to invade my seat space with passive aggressive knee touching which doesn't work with my crusty former Marine mentality (I turned that row into a warzone with that idiot) and a neurotic aged Woody Allen type who had diarrhea of the mouth and couldn't shut up I reached for my trusty noise killers. Only to discover to my horror that the cheap P.O.S. had broken. If somebody's little Damien had been wailing behind me like my last trip it would have been unbearable.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Broke after one trip", "unixReviewTime": 1354233600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2012"}
