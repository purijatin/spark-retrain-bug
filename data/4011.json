Very portable, very sturdy, and very cheap. 5 star worthy on that alone.Lots of bass, not the best bass but it is fun to listen too sometimes. The low end is definitely exaggerated but not like other reviews would have you believe.Mids are good, a little lifeless but very god to listen too on the go. Accuratish, and they aren't over emphasized.The highs, ehn. Well again they aren't great but they really do sound nice, if that makes sense. They aren't perfect and at times sound a little slow but these aren't $200 can either, they can be had for $25 if you know when to buy.Value:  10/10 Nothing in this price range competes.Build Quality: 8/10 Very well built but not indestructible.Sound Overall: 7/10 There are better portable phones.Sound Value  : 10/10Overall rating: 9/10I can't give 4.5 stars so I give it 5.On a side note my pair weren't like the picture, more like the best buy pair in one of the buyers note pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Changed design but still good.", "unixReviewTime": 1320796800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2011"}
