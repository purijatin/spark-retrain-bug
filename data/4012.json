These were around 30 dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money.  Granted I think the Sennheiser were a little better, but you cannot beat these at this price point.  They defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well.  Where I think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange, and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones, but that's expected at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sounds Great", "unixReviewTime": 1376784000, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2013"}
