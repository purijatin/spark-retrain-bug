From the moment you have them on, listen to music and think you are using a $350 pair of headphones. The sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price. I just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review - they are that good. They do leak a bit of sound so I would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral (the look may also be a bit of a giveaway) but other than that - they are simply unbelievable. Highly recommended. As far as the comparison to the PX100 - my wife has those (these were a replacement for my pair that I gave someone as a present) and the sound quality of the Koss is far better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding", "unixReviewTime": 1308009600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2011"}
