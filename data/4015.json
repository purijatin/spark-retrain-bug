I carry these with me for my travels where they serve as movie and music headphones and they do a great job. Would I want to take a more audiophile approach I would turn to a pair of HD 598's or similar, but these do just what they're supposed to do.Really like 'em!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Neat sound in compact format", "unixReviewTime": 1376611200, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2013"}
