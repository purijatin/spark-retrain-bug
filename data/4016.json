But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great, cheap headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2011"}
