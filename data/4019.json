At first, they may sound a bit bass-heavy compared to other headphones, but once you get used to it, it sounds great.  Powerful and full sound.  I find them super comfortable on the firm setting, but I have a narrow head I think.  The additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level.  They fold up fairly small but it's hard to fit them in the leather bag provided.  I wish they came with a hard case for true protection while traveling.A great product which I would definitely buy again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing sound for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1275264000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2010"}
