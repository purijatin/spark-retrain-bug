Petersen \"Broadcast Professional\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "My very first set of headphones (purchased in 1970) were a set of Koss Pro 4AA.  They were heavy, rugged and sounded great when plugged into my Kenwood receiver. Thirty-six years later, the 4AA's still sound great, but are not at all portable.The earbuds that came with my iPod sound allright, but lack bass response.  I tried a set of Sony EX-51 earbuds.  Better bass, but uncomfortable.After much research, I decided to give the PortaPros a listen.  Actually, I would have loved to have found a retailer who carried the PortaPros so I could listen to them before purchasing, but having no luck at the local \"big box\" retailers, I decided to purchase the head phones via the internet and audition them at home.No dissapointment.  These are a quality set of cans.  Great sound, great price, and a lifetime warranty as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality From a Classic", "unixReviewTime": 1164758400, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2006"}
