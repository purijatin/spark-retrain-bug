I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound in a small package", "unixReviewTime": 1269388800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2010"}
