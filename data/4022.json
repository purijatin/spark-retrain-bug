Could be a bit crisper and have more presence.  If you like bass, this is your set- awesome (too much for my taste, really).  Nice not to have to stick anything inside your ear. Pops open too easily when folded up.  Sometimes pulls at your hair when resizing it on your head.  An earpad has popped out of its socket a couple of times, but it pops right back in- seems fragile but is more durable than it looks.  Adjusting tabs on each side reset when you take if off your head.  Consider whether you would rather have noise-canceling or inline volume adjuster before you decide. If not, it's a good choice and a good value.May 2010 update: I had one of the cords pull out of the earpiece and sent it back to the company for a replacement- only paid shipping. They sent me a new unit. It's cheap, it's good, and it's a keeper in my book, even 5 years later.Feb. 2012 update: Still going strong.Mar. 2013 update: keeps going, and going...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value", "unixReviewTime": 1128902400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2005"}
