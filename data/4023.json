And let me say that I have tried them ALL. Everything from earbuds to on-ear, and even over the ear headphones.A friend of mine suggested the PortaPros to me. At first I was turned off because of the way they looked, but I decided to take a chance. Once I got them on I think they look cool, and my fianc&eacute; calls them my 'Tron' headphones. I have actually grown to like the retro, 80's look.But on to the sound.. They sound AMAZING. I won't even say 'for the price'. They just sound great. I needed a headphone that were 'open air', that way I can still hear my coworkers around me. These are on-ear, 'open air' design, but don't let that fool you. They have GREAT bass response and sound crystal clear, no matter what the volume is. Keep in mind I work in a pretty quiet environment, so I am not sure how they'd hold up on a busy city bus.The fit is also GREAT. They are SO adjustable. It took me a few days to find just the right fit, but now that I have I will never go to any other headphone for day-to-day use. I have a great pair of Sony 7506's for podcasting / studio environment, but these are so great for work and travel. The way they fold up is genius, and Koss even included a nice little pouch to store them in.All in all, I give it an A! The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is because that the cord is just a BIT too short. Other than that, these headphones are a completely solid investment!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "So great that I bought 2 more pair for xmas gifts!", "unixReviewTime": 1387238400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2013"}
