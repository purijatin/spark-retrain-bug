They were created in the 80's, and because they got such a great response, the company hasn't changed anything about them - including the design. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing. For the price that you're paying (about 30 bucks), these things are 100% worth the money. They appear a little flimsy, but it's pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in. They also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it, which was really convenient for me since I got to use them for my keyboard which requires a 1/4\" stereo plug instead of a 1/8\". Furthermore, they're really not that fragile. I accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones, but it just snapped right back in and I haven't had any problems. They also have a lifetime warranty in case anything DOES happen to them, which is always a plus. Definitely a great investment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WOW.", "unixReviewTime": 1269216000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2010"}
