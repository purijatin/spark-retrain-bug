I just simply bought this since they looked very portable, light-weight, cool, and contain some bass. Apparently, this headphone almost sounds as good as my 200 dollar Beats by bull(___) HD.For a price of 40 and the incredibly small size, this headphone is simply amazing. Bass is reasonable enough, though some House music, metal, or dubstep can make the bass sound all mixed-up and rather disgusting than clear; however, if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around 300-400 or even higher :). Other than that, I didn't find any part of its sound quality less than I expected. Besides, I didn't even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphone!I use this whenever I am doing some exercise, and so far I find no need to buy another earphone or a light-weight-on-ear headphone.Great job Koss, I just simply love this.
