It's the best in its class and beats many other headphones that are way more expensive.This headphone require some breaking-in period (at least 40 hours), otherwise you may find the bass to be overpowering and fatiguing, as I did at first.  I put the headphone in continuous play through an amplifier for over 40 hrs non-stop at med-high volume.  Now they sound better-- less fatiguing and more \"laid back,\" as the audio geeks would say.If you want more portability, try the cheaper Koss KSC-50.  They are clip-ons but sound almost the same as the PortaPros.  I said almost, because the PortaPros are punchier and have more defined bass.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a reference headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1104537600, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2005"}
