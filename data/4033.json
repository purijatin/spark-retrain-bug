But the annoyances didn't take long to appear. And they all have nothing to do with the audio quality of this product.The headphones will pull your hair, no matter how short it is. I trimmed my hair down to half a centimeter and the bands still manage to somehow yank on it. Very annoying! So as long as you are bald or intend to use these over a cap, you should be fine. Otherwise, stay away.Secondly, I have an issue with the durability of the cable/cord on the connector. I used this on my ipod touch for not even a whole month and the rubber had tore off. I had to use some electrical tape over that part to keep the cord from further damage. Although they have an unconditional lifetime warranty, I have not gotten around to sending these back for a replacement yet.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Hair nightmare", "unixReviewTime": 1265500800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2010"}
