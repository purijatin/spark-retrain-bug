These FAR outperform anything that says BEATS on it, at a tiny fraction of the price (our very brand conscious son actually bought and immediately returned a $300 pair after using these).The sound is, again, spectacular.The comfort, however, is less than stellar (the steel band hurts the top of their heads after a while), and they do cause some pretty ugly hair tangles for the girls.  For intermittent use, they're fine - but in long sessions, they have been associated with frequent whining.The only real downside we've found is that the cords are outrageously frail.  One yank (trip or snag related), and they're toast.  The conductors are SO tiny that repair almost requires microsurgical procedures.  It can be done, but you'll need a jeweler's eyepiece, tiny fingers and a lot of patience.Forewarned is forearmed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent performance for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1379030400, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2013"}
