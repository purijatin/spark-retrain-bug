I had a set of in ear bugs and although they were great my ears would hurt after wearing them.  The Koss phones are very portable and have amazing sound for the price.  Many people said that the bass was to much but I found that for the music I listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music.  One problem is that when they retract or pull apart, your hair can get caught in them.  These are also not noise cancelling phones so that you will hear a lot of external sound.  For me I wear them sometimes when driving so that works perfect for me.  I would recommend them as being really a good buy for the price if you are looking for a portable non noise cancelling headphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1224806400, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2008"}
