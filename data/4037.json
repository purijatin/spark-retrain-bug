They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?  You will be very happy with the PortaPro.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "KOSS PORTAPRO IS A WINNER", "unixReviewTime": 1121212800, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2005"}
