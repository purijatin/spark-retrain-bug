The bass was ok I thought, until a really heavy bass note hit and these things showed a little more power, and much deeper bass. The build could of been better, but for a pair of on ear headphones I wasn't expecting the heaviest build, these are about just as durable as most sets of on ear. However these come with a life time warrenty. These do start to hurt my ears eventually, I keep the comfort setting to light, so I can get more hours out of these in comfort. I can say I have a set over over ear headphones which sound better then these, but also cost 4 times as much. For walking around, on the go, these are great, they sound good, light weight, but dorky looking. None the less i am a college nerd, so I guess it works out for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sweet", "unixReviewTime": 1317686400, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2011"}
