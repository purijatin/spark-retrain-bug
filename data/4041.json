The amount of richness (esp base) was surprising - i couldn't believe my laptop (usually very sub-par sound) and Rio Karma (as compared to the Sennheiser MX300 earbuds) could output such quality tones.  My brother recommended these (he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me), as he uses these during his commute instead of his Grado SR 125's which were getting beat up and aren't nearly as comfortable as the Koss PortaPros.  Though obviously not anywhere as 'elite' as Grados or Beyers, I find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his Grado's. Additionally, the tension adjustment is a really nice feature, and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses.  Additionally, they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accents.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1106611200, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2005"}
