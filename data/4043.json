For a sub $40 price, you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price. But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200.The bass, which was great by 80s standards, can't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones. Otherwise, there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive. I did hear many sounds (mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music) which I couldn't hear with my inferior iPod headphones. But again, the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior, then this headphone is great. Unless you want to look retro 80s, however, you may want to wear them inside.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent for the 80s. Just good by today's standards.", "unixReviewTime": 1238457600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2009"}
