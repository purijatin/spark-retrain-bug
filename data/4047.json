I bought a second pair to keep handy in my basement with my home theater system for when it's late and I don't want to wake up my wife while watching a loud movie. These are very comfortable to wear (as opposed to earbuds, which I can't stand and are generally weak on sound), and I haven't owned or used a pair of headphones that sound as good as these, including some $100 closed-ear models. The sound is clear, with the right balance of bass and treble. A lot of headphones do not have enough bass, or if they do, the overall sound is muffled. These find the right balance, and sound great for music or movies. And at this price, I doubt you could beat it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best-sounding headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1354924800, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2012"}
