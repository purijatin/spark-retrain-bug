Not much else that can be asked for from a set of headphones at this prices range.The sound quality and comfort are both fairly exceptional, although it should be noted that they let a lot of sound leak both in and out courtesy of their design. On the other hand for a traveling headphone of light build, that isn't always a problem. The lifetime warranty should be noted as well. I had to use it once because one of the sides went dead, but they replaced the set and I'm back to enjoying them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A goo set of headphones at the pirce", "unixReviewTime": 1365552000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2013"}
