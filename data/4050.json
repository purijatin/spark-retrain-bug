Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Excellent sound, superb comfort, lacking low-end bass.", "unixReviewTime": 1285891200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2010"}
