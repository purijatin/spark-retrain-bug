I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I do have a few pairs of expensive and sophisticated earphones with super-sonic so and so and ultra-isonalting this and that. They're great and have their uses, but if all you need is a pair of earphones that you can carry in your jacket pocket or laptop bag, you won't find a serious competitor to the PortaPros.They're compact, sturdy, and of reasonable quality. Will you get the same quality as a pro set of headphones? Of course not, but you likely don't need high fidelity if you're on the metro, studying, watching Youtube, or perusing your podcasts.If you need a pair of nifty, retro, collapsible, and decent quality headphones, pick these up.Note that the phones themselves are about the size of an average ear. They will not cover your entire ear.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun, retro, decent quality", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}
