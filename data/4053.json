I have used the Koss lifetime warranty several times in that period, and every time it's been just fine.  On one pair I had even soldered on my own replacement plug, and I called Koss to make sure they would still be covered.  The man on the phone said, \"You could chop them up into a million pieces and mail the pieces to us in a bag, and we'd still send you a replacement set.\"  Now that's customer service!Sound Quality:  You will not find anything in this price range that even comes close.  The bass is deeper than you would expect for such a small device, and the highs are clear.  The sound is not fatiguing at all.  I listen to them at the office every day for up to 8 hours and they are brilliant.Comfort:  Since they are open-ear design, they don't make your head sweat.  The metal band can snag your hair occasionally but it's not a major problem.Looks: 80's tastic.  I think that's a plus, your mileage may vary.Value for money: unbeatable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing deal for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1320796800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2011"}
