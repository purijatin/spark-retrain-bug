I've invested thousands in high-end headphones, DACS, and dedicated amplifiers and I consider myself to be pretty picky. You can trust that I would give a negative review if it was warranted.For the money, you would be hard pressed to find any headphone that sounds better. Good bass without being overstated, highs are clear with good extension, and mid-range isn't harsh (my biggest complaint with headphones under the $200 mark). These have a similar sound signature to my beloved Sennheiser PX100's (not the sub-standard PX100 II (two's) that have replaced that discontinued model) at a similar price point.For anyone looking for good quality sound on a budget, you can't beat these... trust me, I've tried them all!Don't expect much in the way of isolation (blocking outside noise from coming in, or keeping your sounds from coming out) with these, and the sound quality is much more apparent in quiet environments.These don't really need an amplifier for normal listening, but I do find that they require a little more power than my Zune will put out if I'm on an airplane or train.I'd buy these again if lost or stolen.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great travel headphones for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1360540800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013"}
