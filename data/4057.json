I have to &#34;repair&#34; it a few times..now I am extra careful when removing from my head...3) the cable is way too short! only about 0.5m I think...I am using in on my PC..lucky I have front speaker jack...definately will not be able to fit the back panel speaker jack..", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "good sound, but lotsa design flaw in this..", "unixReviewTime": 1386460800, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2013"}
