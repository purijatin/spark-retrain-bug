Cord just the right length so that I can put my minidisc player in my pocket.  Just one thing that keeps me from giving them 5 starts.  Every time I take them off the metal bands slide so that I have to readjust them every time I put them on again.  A set of headphones like these that stayed the way I set them would get 5 stars.Added in edit:  Amazon lets you edit your reviews, but not your star-rankings.  I'm not changing a word of the text, but having to adjust the headband is proving to be an annoyance.  Lower my star ranking to 3.  From what I gather, there are lots of good headphones out there.  I wouldn't buy another pair of these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If only they didn't readjust every time they're removed", "unixReviewTime": 1152662400, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2006"}
