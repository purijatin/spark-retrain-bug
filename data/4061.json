They never wore out, outlasting the radio by more than a decade, and I eventually misplaced them.  I was thrilled to discover they're still available after all these years.  They're comfortable and durable, and they sound great.  Lifetime warranty, too. Very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century. The Koss PortaPros are tried and true, and still relevant. Imagine that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tried and true!", "unixReviewTime": 1211155200, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2008"}
