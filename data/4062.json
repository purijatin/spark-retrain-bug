Smerda \"Just the Facts, Ma'am\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Awesome little headphones, some of the best sounding set I have ever owned. They're a little rough to look at, but I am very glad I gave them a try. These sound terrific, and adjust for your ears with lighter pressure, if you so desire. The only drawback I would see for these has to do with their higher impedance, at 60 ohms, as opposed to a lower impedance for most portables out there. The higher impedance means that batteries would empty quicker when used with mobile gear, but well worth the money for the sound. Amazing product, I will buy a second pair as a back-up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "PortaPro is a hit!", "unixReviewTime": 1288569600, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2010"}
