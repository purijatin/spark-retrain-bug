They sound great, and they fold well for easy carrying.  For a non-audiophile (please note that before any other comments)  I didn't hear much difference between several other more expensive sets.  They have a rich sound and I have yet to listen to anything they don't play well.  However there is one HUGE thing that isn't stressed enough here although I did see it mentioned before I purchased mine.  I bought mine to study with and no one will study with me anymore due to the leakage.  These leak a lot.  My wife can hear me listening to lectures and my study partners can hear my music three seats down.  They are great but should not be purchased to listen to in a library.  The hair pulling happens occasionally, but you get past that by putting them on carefully and it isn't a huge hassle.  A little hard for me to get in the carry case also.  I am purchasing another set for study, but let me be clear, I AM KEEPING THESE for all other uses.  I just want to make sure you don't buy these for quiet surroundings.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Awesome EXCEPT for Libraries", "unixReviewTime": 1334016000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2012"}
