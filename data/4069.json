Johnston", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I've tried out a number of portable headphones and these are the best I've found so far.  This is the second pair I've purchased since I liked the first set so well, and wanted another for my laptop bag.PROS:Good sound quality, lightweight, comfortable, fold up easily into a carry bag so it's portable.  The folded set fits very nicely into limited laptop storage compartments.CONS:Kinda flimsy feel, although I've had the first pair for over a year with no problems.  They also look a bit dorky but, eh, whatever.Overall I think this is a nice choice for the price.UPDATE:  I had the wire to the right phone short out after just over 1 year.  This pair doesn't get folded that often (and these are foldable, travel type phones), so I don't think that reflects well on the unit.  I've downgraded to 3 stars based on this issue.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice sound for the price - Durability So So", "unixReviewTime": 1346284800, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2012"}
