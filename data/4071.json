Feldman", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "With all of the hype related to these headphones, I was expecting to be let down in some way at the very least.  However, after many months of use at the office, I've come to believe that these headphones are really something special.  It's hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensive/lightweight product.  They are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone, but they really shine when plugged into my laptops(with beats audio and without).  Solid, but tight bass, rich mids, and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that you've been listening to for years.  Do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair.  You won't regret it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Cans", "unixReviewTime": 1343692800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2012"}
