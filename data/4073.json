Moore", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Hands down the best sounding headphones I have ever purchased.They really should be broken in for optimum sound though; hook them up to an audio source and let it play through them for about 24 hours.  After breaking in they will sound amazing.I've read quite a few reviews about how some $10 pair of headphones sounds just as good/better and I can tell you that it's crap.  Some people can't tell the difference between bass and quality.  If all you want it bass with no fidelity you'll be sadly mistaken but if you want bright, clear sound with a good range and great clarity, these are awesome for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best sub $50 headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1385769600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2013"}
