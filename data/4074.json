As I wrote in my review of the PX-100s (http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6FUMDQJ2RW/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), I found them uncomfortable, and lacking in bass.  These PortaPros fix both those problems: I can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore, but this is a big improvement over the Sennheiser PX 100s, which started hurting after only about an hour.  Bass is good enough, though perhaps lacking slightly compared to high-end headphones.  But, for $40 these offer a great bang-for-buck in sound quality.The only negatives are the retro look (if that bothers you - I don't mind it at all), and if you have long hair (I don't), the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands; I know when this starts happening to me, it's time for a haircut :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than the Sennheiser PX 100", "unixReviewTime": 1350604800, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2012"}
