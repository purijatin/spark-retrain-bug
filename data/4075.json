Moving around much?  They have a tight grip on your head.  Durable, I once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and I simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened.  Short cord for people who don't wander 20 feet away from their audio player (laptop, mp3 player) like some other headphones have.Cons:  I've heard people say how comfy they are, but my hat size of 7 1/2 says very different.  After a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache.  And that's whether I have sound running through them or not.  On occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them.I use these for my laptop and iPod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming.  Base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough.  Mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as I like the 90 deg ones much better but it works regardless.  I'd recommend these to other people. The only drawback I can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours.  Maybe if you have a smaller head you'll be ok?  They can seem flimsy, but I've had them for 2 years and have traveled with them so I couldn't justify and claims of them being \"cheap\" headphones.  And with a lifetime warranty I say go to town.  I don't use the case at all either, used to, but I deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere.  No regrets on that.I would give the product 5 stars but the headache thing really detracts from them.  I still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones I'd go with these again any day of the week.
