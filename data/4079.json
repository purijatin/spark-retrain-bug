I can understand why, they sound full, open  and music sounds great.  Also comfortable, although I have not worn them for an extended time.  I would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth.  Others may have a difficult time hearing you.  Very please!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss Portapro phones", "unixReviewTime": 1366675200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2013"}
