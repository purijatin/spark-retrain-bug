The NC is a fabulous, if a bit heavy, device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box.  Root the thing and it becomes an android tablet, giving you access to a lot of functionality.I have no issues with reading on the NC.  Adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and I've read for hours with no eye strain.  I'm more than satisfied with it because unlike the Kindle, I can read almost anything (and rooted even Kindle books using the android Kindle app).  Works with library lending, free ebook sites and the Calibre tool helps expand what you can read even more.Hands down, it's the best device out there at the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It ain't a Kindle and that's good!", "unixReviewTime": 1297555200, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2011"}
