Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The sound is simply the best", "unixReviewTime": 1279152000, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2010"}
