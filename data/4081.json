I have owned 3 of them and the plug will short out in 6 months or less if you use them often. I have purchased 3 because I see them as disposable toy junk. I have not found a better sounding phone for 25 dollars so I see it as 50 dollar per year deal. I have Grado 60s and  Sennheiser's  HD 280 pros, for 10 years with no problems, but they are bulky and heavy for travel and exercise.I have owned Sennheiser's 100s and 200s and they sound as good but no better, and they cost 2 times more and the last 6 months or less as well or snap like a rotten twig.I may buy the Koss pros again and tape the plug area to reduce the stress, but I know that 6 months or so they will end up in the trash. Buy them, but no one I know has had a pair last longer than a year with light use. If they are lost or stolen you will not feel bad as the person who steals of finds them will get the honor to throw them away. It's a shame, but Koss has destroyed their once good name because their quality has been lost and I wonder how they can compete with other companies who make phone with fashion and style and the durability to stand the stress from younger folks who wear phones for hours everyday. I guess a week tops and they will short out.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Short out in 6 months", "unixReviewTime": 1387670400, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2013"}
