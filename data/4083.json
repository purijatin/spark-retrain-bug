For several months I was happy.  The sound quality is right up there with the PX100.  However, I use headphones pretty much everyday for running, exercising, walking, etc.  I need them to last and take a beating.  I am constantly pulling on the cord by accident or even dropping my mp3 player detaching it from the plug.  Now after maybe 6 months of use I have lost sound in the right ear.  It sometimes drops in and out but this is mainly due to the cable being loose inside the earpiece.  It is pretty much unrepairable.  The Sennheisers also cut out in this same manner but they lasted 2 years.  I guess one way you can look at it is that you can buy 3 of these for the price of 1 PX100.  I'm not sure if I will try to buy these again yet.  It seems that the part where the cable enters the headphone is the weak link in a lot of portable headphones. . . or maybe I am just too rough with them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not durable at all", "unixReviewTime": 1260144000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2009"}
