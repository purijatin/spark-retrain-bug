This price is 1/2 of the MSRP!  I have owned Porta-Pros for nearly 30 years. Just recently, I had the chance to compare them with super high end 'phones costing $350 and $1350(!).  Both were over the ear models.  While these pricey 'phones delivered superb sound,  the difference from the Koss 'phones, in my opinion did not justify spending 12 to 40 times as much money!  More importantly,  the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable, in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head, and so severe  that I had to reach for the bottle of Motrin.  By contrast, the Koss 'phones, with adjustable ear pressure, are supremely comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without any problems.  Finally, Koss stands by their lifetime guarantee- no questions asked, even if you mistakenly sit on them.  In summary,  you absolutely will love this headphone.  Even the Stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible price/performance ratio of this stellar product.  Unconditionally recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The headphon bargain of the century.", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}
