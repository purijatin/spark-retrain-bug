The bass isn't amped, but you don't want it to be if you're producing music.For what it is, plus the lifetime warranty ($6 for shipping) - I've suggest these to many a person.P.S. - It's been over a year of heavy use, and even losing them once in a moshpit, only to later find them sweaty, but unharmed!These things can take a hit, and the bass is still better than I thought it would be.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the money, can't be beat.", "unixReviewTime": 1320451200, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2011"}
