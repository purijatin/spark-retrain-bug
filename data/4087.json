And I felt like I got a brand new one back in the mail.  They even replaced the cushions.The sound quality of this headphone is very VERY good.  Lets just say that it has its own style.I can say for sure, that...  Highs are clear, and the base is on the heavy side, and it has just enough surround sound.  But the sound quality of these headphones are so unique that you just have to try them out for yourself.If you are an audiophile, you got to have one of these just because it's worth having it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They stand by their Lifetime Warranty", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}
