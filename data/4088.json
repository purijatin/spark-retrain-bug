I went through two pairs in a few years but was absolutely bummed when I heard that they were no longer producing them. Instead, they improved on the design but I didn't want to spend the extra money and the reviews weren't as promising as the original models.Instead, I looked around and settled on the PortaPros. The sound is awesome, the storage is very good (not as great as the PX100's), they are very durable, the cord length is perfect, and the 1980 throwback design is just a bonus. Once I wear down my current pair that I'm using right now, I will definitely have to buy another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "PX100 Replacements", "unixReviewTime": 1358553600, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2013"}
