First time I tried them on it was unbelieveable how well they sounded.  Even the low end is pretty good for such a lightweight headphone.Previously I had a set of Altec Lansing UHP304 Headphones which I paid well over $80.  They sounded very good, but after less than a year of use a short developed in the cable and one side kept cutting out.  I returned to Altec Lansing and never heard anything from them.  No more Altec Lansing.  These Koss headphones at less than half the price and equal sound quality, and with a lifetime limited warranty can not be beat.  Had them for over a year and still sound great.  The sensitivity is also excellent which means I do not have to turn up the volume as much as with some of the cheaper headphones.A quick note about Koss, I had a set of Pro 4AAA (I think) headphones that I bought in the early 1980's.  I started having problems with them.  I wrote a letter to Koss and sent it with the headphones to them and in a few weeks I had my headphones back repaired and working perfectly.  And this was around 2003.  Still have the headphones, even bought an upgrade version of them.Good company, good product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1293321600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010"}
