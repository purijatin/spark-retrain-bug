They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2014"}
