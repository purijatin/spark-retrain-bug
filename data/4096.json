They sound basically as good as pro studio headphones. Totally effortless, full range of sound that is completely clear. And since they are open, you can still hear things around you, so you don't walk around with that sensory-deprived \"living in a cloud, disconnected from the world\" feeling.Also they're totally comfortable. Cannot go wrong with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Completely amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}
