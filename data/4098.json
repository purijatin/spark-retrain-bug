Sound as good as my Grado SR60 at about half the size and cost.  Seem to be very well constructed but I've only had them a few days.Stayed in place on my head through a sweaty 6-mile jog this morning.  First time I've had my tunes along on a jog and I highly recommend it.I run on a busy highway so I wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety.  I could hear the traffic and the music.  With no outside noise, the music is just incredible.  I use 320kbps mp3 mostly and, although I have a pretty good pc stereo setup (M-AUDIO, Kenwood, Bose), I heard not only new musical nuances but words which I had not previously recognized.I don't pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but I've been into music a long time.  We're into SACD, DVD-Audio with Klipsch and Polk speakers so I think I've heard some pretty good music.  I was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones.  Oh, I've tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a Sansa Clip player.  Both sound terrific.They don't look as hip as the little buds but they don't look totally dork either.  Cable is plenty long enough for me.  Now, I did hear a slight click with each jogging step which I think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself.  It may begin to bother me and if so I'll try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didn't detract from the music at all.I think most people will really like these phones.  I definitely do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Glad I bought these babies!", "unixReviewTime": 1226188800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2008"}
