These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best headphones you can get for less than $50", "unixReviewTime": 1381017600, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2013"}
