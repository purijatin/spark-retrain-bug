They sound phenomenal for the price. The only negative is the weakness of the cords. After a year or two of normal use, one side or the other may break its connection and there's no way you can fix it yourself (many tiny strands to solder). I have returned mine twice to Koss (great lifetime warranty) and they have replaced them for a small $6 shipping charge. It takes about 3-4 weeks. That's my only complaint.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound, weak cord", "unixReviewTime": 1265932800, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2010"}
