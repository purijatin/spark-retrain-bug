But I bought them for playing electric guitar, piano, and violin thru them for prartice. The extra ohm \"60\" makes the diff over the 32 ohm ones on the market. I didn't want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour. These are feather lite and really can't even tell they are on your head. You line 6 Pod users or other multi effect users, well lover these. the extra ohm does make a diff in tone. No ice picking or high shrill. Rich bass and tone through out. Very pleased with them. As well as the tone for MP3's. Very rich tone all the way around. At 60 ohm you won't notice that much of a diff for mp3's. But for playing musical instruments thru them, the extra ohm makes a BIG diff in tone.Well be using these with my Line 6 Pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long. They are not like my Marshall Stack, but they excellent.I know my neighbors well love em..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent in everyway!", "unixReviewTime": 1240531200, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2009"}
