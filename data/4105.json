Lion \"kimbawlion.com\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "Ok, I went on a headphone buying spree, so I'm comparing these PortaPros to headphones that cost many times as much (Sennheiser HD595), headphones that cost a bit more (Sennheiser PX100) and my old Sony headphones. Well, my Sonys are history. I never realized how smeary they were--no detail.These Koss PortaPros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones I mentioned. Good detail and the frequency balance is excellent, far preferable to the PX100s and even comparable to the expensive phones. Very pleasant to listen to. If I had never heard those expensive phones, I would be happy to have these Koss PortaPros as my only phones.What I've learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as \"soundstage\". With the Koss phones, everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears. Not unpleasant, and you won't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself, but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic. I know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison, but I just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid for.So the bottom line is, I am in love with the sound of my expensive HD595 headphones and at the same time I am very happy to have these Koss PortaPros for portable use. As a bonus, the PortaPros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones. And, unlike some folks, I wouldn't say they are ugly at all--just different.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value. Very pleasant.", "unixReviewTime": 1178841600, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2007"}
