Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the &#34;standard ear-buds&#34;.  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound for an inexpensive set of headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1368057600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2013"}
