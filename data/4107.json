The reason being that they got it right the first time. The sound quality is great for open design headphones, they're easily adjustable (both the headband and the firmness with which the ears &#34;grab&#34; the head), very light, and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issues.They fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag. If mine get damaged, I will buy another pair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Classic headphones with Retro design", "unixReviewTime": 1393027200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2014"}
