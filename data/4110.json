Mine came with a drawstring pouch that was difficult to insert the phones into (I lost it when I sent them back for repair the first time).  Koss has some hard cases but one of the comments was that the case was way too big - not conducive to travel.Overall Grade - A for sound, B for comfort, C for sturdiness, the missing volume control and case, and the minor annoyances.Overall I'm pleased with these (would not have kept them for ten years otherwise) but perfect they ain't.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Koss PortaPro Headphones - Still looking for the perfect travel headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1241222400, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2009"}
