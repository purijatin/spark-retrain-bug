They sound incredible, and are best for working out/walking with an iPod.  NOTHING compares. Not the ipod ear buds, not $300 isolation headphones that go in your ear (i wasted big time and money on them)...nothing.  If you only buy two headphones in your lifetime, but these for your ipod and a pair of Grado SR60's/80's for home ipod/stereo use.  YOu will be happy you did.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Porta Pros Rock", "unixReviewTime": 1141344000, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2006"}
