The sound is, especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit, clear with a more than adequate amount of bass.  As a bonus, the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful.  Bottom line...a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience.  Try them...you'll like them!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Listening is Believing\"", "unixReviewTime": 1387497600, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2013"}
