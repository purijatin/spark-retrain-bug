Hoffman", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "I bought these along with a similarly priced set of Sennheiser headphones about 9 months ago.  Not until I recently purchased a Zen Micro did I decide to test all my headphones on this MP3 player.  Needless to say, other than the Bose QC2 set, which is essentially in a league of its own, the Koss beat out every other set I own.  This includes both Denon and Sony closed systems.I guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase.  So, they were relegated to the bookshelf until the Zen player arrived.  I have to say that the goofy looking design is just that.  However, the sound quality (clarity, separation, tonal balance, etc.) is exceptional for an open ear system.  Nearly every bit as good as the Bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I found great sound now that I'm using them", "unixReviewTime": 1127088000, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2005"}
