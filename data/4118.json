Busch", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewtext": "I really like these headphones, but as others point out, they are not very durable. My first pair broke after a year -- and I am very careful with my equipment. I only use them at my computer, they don't travel or get abused. They fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot. Anyway, the sound was great -- very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs. They sound nearly as good as my entry-level Grados, but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. But buy two pairs now, or plan on replacing them later.-edit-Several years later, I am back to say that the two additional pairs I bought are both going strong and they are still the best quality/comfort/price combination in the world. I have more accurate in-ear phones that cost $200+, but for comfort and long listening sessions, these can't be beat. I hope they are never discontinued. The design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head, but once you hear them, you won't care.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great while they last...", "unixReviewTime": 1085184000, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2004"}
