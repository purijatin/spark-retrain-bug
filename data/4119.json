Coleman", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I listened to several non-earbud headphones from $10-$100 and these are the best between them. While I haven't listened to headphones over $100 I believe it would sound better than many of those too (possibly the best ever). Good clarity with good bass.Very good construction too. Can adjust to a lighter setting for more comfort.Only 1 minor issue. If the earpads aren't centered on your ear or if you have big ears then sometimes the edges of the pad can press uncomfortably on your ear (only felt if you leave them on a while). Probably KOSS should offer a larger size (keeping the speaker the same though) or make the original pads at the edges (outer radius) slightly concave away from the ear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones under $100", "unixReviewTime": 1202688000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2008"}
