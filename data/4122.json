The quality of sound reproduction, they do deserve a high rating.  If you aren't using them a noisy environment--they have no real passive or active noise blocking.  You can't be dissatisfied with the quality of sound reproduction.I was surprised by the light build and somewhat small size of them.  They certainly don't make a satisfying thud when you toss them onto a coffee table -- which probably isn't that good of idea anyway.  So, this lightness and somewhat small size I can just as easily viewed as a plus as well a minus.I really expected headphones which has been manufactured for decades to come with an RCA phono-plug rather than a modern one.  While I find it probably handier to have a modern type plug on the headphones, I really think they should have included a phono-plug  adapter with it.I'm not going against the years' of reviews before mine.  The sound from these headphone are clear, crisp, and has a fine frequency range.  I seriously doubt you're going to find anything  better than these headphones when they're on sale. The quality of sound reproduction was what I expected, I was just startled by the small size and heft of them.  You might find that a very pleasant surprise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}
