The collapsible band has two plastic pieces which press into the top of my head. There is no way to keep them away from my head without having the headset so loose that it falls off. Maybe I just have a small head or not enough hair but I like my Sennheiser PX100s better. They have a padded band which is very comfortable and I never feel the headset pressing on the top of my head and the sound quality is just as good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sound but uncomfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1158969600, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2006"}
