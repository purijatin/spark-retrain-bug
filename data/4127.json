Sure, I could understand four, but two stars? These things are amazing! The only two cons I would have are that 1) they could be more portable: the \"earpieces\" don't rotate, so when you compress everything down to its most portable size, it's still more of a sphere than a circle. 2) Yes, I know that open-backed speakers are known for better sound, but I've had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song I'm listening to because these things \"leak out\" so much sound. The main problem with this (other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you) is that they don't work very well for plane riding or anything where it's loud (It was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week). Other than those two things, these things are great. Speaking of folding flat earpieces, one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers, (I probably spelled that wrong) and he used to lend them to me for a long time until I got these, but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead! So overall, I recommend these to anyone who just wants a cheap, yet VERY high quality pair of cans (but check out the Grado sr80i/60i, they may be a little bit less portable, but they're that much more amazing!).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "simply: NICE!", "unixReviewTime": 1271462400, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2010"}
