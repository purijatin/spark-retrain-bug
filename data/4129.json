Great sound, lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores. Unlike earbuds, they stay in place. They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them, you will break them. But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "for the price, you can't beat the quality", "unixReviewTime": 1325030400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2011"}
