She really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months. Then I decided to root it and turn it into a full Android tablet. Now it's sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she can't live without. Performance isn't bad on anything we've installed. Rooting takes some tech skills, but isn't too bad. I would highly recommend the tablet even if you don't root it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1324166400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2011"}
