There is an emphasis on base but that's OK, I'm using this set with my FLAC player when I want music to wake me up and get me excited. I'm very happy with the purchase. If however you're looking for the perfect balance of sound and frequencies spend more money! For the average listener who just wants to get pumped, this is the set to buy. Besides, If you're listening to an iPod or any MP3 why would you want to spend more on a headset? There is only so much improvement that can be made considering the supression of the sound coming out of the device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow", "unixReviewTime": 1388102400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013"}
