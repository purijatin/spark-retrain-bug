I had to find some that were cheap, as my Turtle Beach TBS-2052 Ear Force Z2 was damaged. I'm glad I listened to the good reviews I found.Surprisingly, the bass is deep, despite the size and type of headphones. If you like or not, that is a matter of personal taste. In my opinion, I had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound.One more thing: these headphones are not pretty, but its quality and durability are excellent.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality Product", "unixReviewTime": 1312934400, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2011"}
