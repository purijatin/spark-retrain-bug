Dickson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "The first thing I will say is that when I got these headphones they were a lot smaller than I envisioned.  The retro look reminded me of some old headphones I had that were much larger.  I suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portables.Pros:The sound quality is great for portables.  They sound even better than some of the lower-end, ear-covering studio headphones that I have.  I have always liked Koss' attention bass response in their headphones.  The cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about 3 feet.  Don't get these if you like longer cords.  They fold up very nicely and compact.  It comes with a carrying case and 1/8 to 1/4 adapter.  They are pretty light and comfortable, though a little tighter on wider heads.Cons:They feel somewhat cheap and I imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time (the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit).  My head is on the larger side (while not huge) and I find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting.  They don't seem to cater well to larger heads.  I wish they had some kind of padding on the top of the headband.These are really good portable headphones with great sound quality, as long as your head isn't huge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sounding portables though design could be improved.", "unixReviewTime": 1318204800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2011"}
