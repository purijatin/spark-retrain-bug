These are the headphones I've been using for the past four years: Great sound quality and as important, very light and comfortable on the ear, so I can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable. If you want to look like a pro, these aren't for you. They look like what a teeny-bopper would wear. But if you want an amazing combination of sound quality, comfort, and low cost, these are great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Doesn't look professional but sounds it AND is super comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1351555200, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2012"}
