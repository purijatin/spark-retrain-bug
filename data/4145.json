Burdette", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Highly recommended on their own, and especially if you're wanting to spend less than $60 on open-air headphones (in fact, these are a LOT less than $60, almost half that).I ordered my Koss PortaPros from Amazon after having to admit the Sennheiser HD 202 phones I ordered in August 2010 were not comfortable and had muddy bass.  I wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed, and I really wanted to LOVE the HD202s.  The reviews were great, the price was great, and they are \"Sennheisers\".  All to naught.  I should have listened to my gut and heeded the few reviews that commented on the boomy bass.I had a pair of the original Koss PortaPros back in the mid 1980s and remember them very fondly.  These current PortaPros are simply great headphones.  They are clear, free from distortion, the bass is all there and punchy, not boomy or muddy in the least.The best thing I can say about headphones is that they don't just \"sound good for headphones\", they produce a very good sound.  And these Koss have great sound - really, very excellent.To be objective - I don't think I'd be quick to let a child use these.  While the build quality feels good, these aren't made for rough handling.If you want some incredibly rugged excellent-sounding budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers, mp3 players, portable DVD players, etc, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones.  I buy these 2-3 pair at a time and always have a pair or two still in the packaging ready to bring out as needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones, incredible value", "unixReviewTime": 1305849600, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2011"}
