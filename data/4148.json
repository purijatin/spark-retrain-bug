When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them.  I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.  Reading the Sportapro review, the plug seems to be a weak link and I'm afraid that the Portapros have the same issue now.  It's really a bummer, they used to be GREAT.  Not sure what to replace them with.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "2nd time is NOT the charm", "unixReviewTime": 1357776000, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2013"}
