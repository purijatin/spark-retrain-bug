HOWEVER, they are the best-sounding portable headphones i've ever owned, period.  simply powerful, deep, clear, intense bass, clear highs, and fantastically accurate midrange.  and unlike many bass-heavy phones, they don't suck the lifeblood out of your poor little iPod.i've been through all sorts of earbuds and cans and found these after experiencing great sound on a previous set of Koss earbuds.  (i've never had any luck with the awkward fit of earbuds, but i can also highly recommend The Plug by Koss if you have no problem with them -- excellent bass and highs.)  anyway, after comparing and contrasting these PortaPros to the other 5 pair i've bought over the years, there is absolutely no contest when it comes to sound reproduction.  sure, they take up a bit more space than earbuds, but they do fold up quite nicely in the provided faux-leather sack.i use them every day for two hours on the subway and they've gone thru the ringer.  no cord problems, no sound problems. the foam rips over the pads after awhile, but with the lifetime warranty, no worries if you have any kind of problems.  $5 in shipping gets you a brand new pair, no questions asked.lastly, yes...okay, they look mighty dorky -- my coworker saw them and told me to get out of the eighties.  but really, it's all about the music, right?  those hipster dorks who shop at American Apparel wish they had this kind of style!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "bought 5 pair before these, and these are by far the best", "unixReviewTime": 1148601600, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2006"}
