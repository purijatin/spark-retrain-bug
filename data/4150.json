I traded in my Ludacris Soul SL99's and some Sennheiser CX310's for cash and I purchased these. LOVE THE SOUND! Totally worth the deal it took to get these. Tight, but not overpowering bass, and crisp mids and highs. I hear all the details in the music, plus the energy exhibited in these phones is just phenomenal for the price. I bought these based on their being a top 5 value pick on CNET, which ranked the Klipsch S4's as the top value headphones. i own two pairs of those, and the Koss Porta Pros, and they couldn't be more accurate. Retro look yet classy. compact. tight fit. tight sound. great price. no complaints.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great over the ear phones! worth the money! CNET top 5 too!", "unixReviewTime": 1348876800, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2012"}
