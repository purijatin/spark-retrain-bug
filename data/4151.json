They are the best headphones I've tried, particularly at this price level, for sound quality.  On an airplane, they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones I've used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound I've encountered with noise cancelling headphones.  Because of the low distortion, I've been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise.  Also, there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level, the passengers next to you won't be bothered as much by loud music.  The headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use.  At home, the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself.  I highly recommend these headphones.  If asked about the negatives, I would say there are 3 things:  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved; the cord is shorter than one would like; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones, which deteriorate over time (but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on Amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace.  Look around on the net for reviews and you will find these are very positively reviewed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best portable headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1327104000, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2012"}
