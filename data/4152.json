The lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase. The headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head. The metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it didn't receive 5 stars for comfort. This style of headphone by design doesn't have very good noise cancellation, which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments, but the portapros still do a decent job with the task. Sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price. These are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos. Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "80's Style with great quality no matter what decade you're in.", "unixReviewTime": 1309219200, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2011"}
