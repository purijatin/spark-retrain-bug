Getz", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I was looking for a small light over-the-ear head phones to use in my office at work. Still need to hear somethings going on around me. I didn't want an expensive set that I would have to lug home with me. Researched the ratings on Amazon and thought I would take a chance. Hadn't really considered Koss in many years. I have a few different Sennheisers that I love but again wanted a small less expensive set. Right out of the box I was wowed by the sound. I am sure they will improve once they are &#34;burned in&#34;. These are very light on my head and I have been wearing them for hours without any discomfort. There is a setting on the side for light for firm pressure (the small blue tab shown in the picture just below the band). Not sure I can tell much of the difference but I set them on light. These things fold-up very small and can be stored in a small leatherette bag (not a &#34;case&#34;) and then fit great inside my desk drawer. Again these had great sound and more bass than expected of something this size and cost. Just a little tweeking with my sound settings on my SIII and I was off and running.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small, Light & Great Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1363651200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2013"}
