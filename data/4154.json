These were bought as a walk around the house headphone. The big thing is: How does Koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone? I wish Koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer, but if you need the best for what these cost, go no further!!! Be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band. They're light, comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressure.I love em!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "How can you pass these up?", "unixReviewTime": 1218240000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2008"}
