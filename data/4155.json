I read good things about them in my online research and was particularly interested in the fact that they were said to have excellent bass for portable headphones.  In fact they do, as part of an overall rich, nicely balanced sound. I also find them to be comfortable and convenient (they fold up into a small circle and fit into a handy pouch.)  They appear to be well made and I anticipate using them for a long time.I also bought a pair of the cheaper Koss PRO1 phones in a two-fer Amazon deal when I bought these, and they're excellent sounding portable phones as well.  The metal construction of the PortaPros likely give them an advantage in durability; the sound quality between the two is comparable.  If you're interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs, mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones (enough low end so that you won't need to use the annoying, sound-sucking bass boost found on most portable players), with good construction to boot, I highly recommend the PortaPros.  They'll definitely sound much better than the phones that come with most Walkman-style devices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Portable Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1168214400, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2007"}
