Was quite disappointed.Like others have said, these units have changed little since the mid 80's but have fanastic range, thump and boom.  Light weight comfortable and affordable.  Highly responsive coils and foldable design.Highly highly recommended as (in my opinion) being the best portable, non-noise cancelling phones on the market.Will make your mp3 player, walkman or discman much more robust sounding and gives very little ear fatigue,'cept after 4 or more hours of use.Getting another pair ASAP!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4.5, actually.
