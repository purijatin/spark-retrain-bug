You can fold them up and put them in my pocket.  I'm generally satisfied with them and would make the purchase again.  My only gripe is that the earpieces tend to detach from the frame.  There's only a small notch and groove holding them together.  Reassembling them when the earpieces come off isn't a huge hassle, but it is annoying.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Only one gripe", "unixReviewTime": 1146787200, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2006"}
