Ferioli", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This must be the 10th pair of headphones I've purchased in the last 5 years.  But I've finally found the one.  I read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound.  And it's great!  I am amazed at how much bass these things produce!  They also fold up well and clip together.  It should be easier to find the cord around them but that's just a minor annoyance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big sound, little package!", "unixReviewTime": 1308268800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2011"}
