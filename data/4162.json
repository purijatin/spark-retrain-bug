They have the puchiness and crisp sound I want! You can hear and feel drum beats as if you were right there with the band!The treble is also quite good, you can hear everything. the voices  are smooth and not high pitched, everything is balanced pretty well. But I feel the treble could be a touch higher.I don't know if the bass is intentionally enhanced, but it sounds a lot louder on these then any other headphones I have. But I like it, certainly makes my music sound more alive and in your face.Also worth noting, these have a nice soundstage, or stage presence if you will. Mostly because they don't cover around your ears.It would be great if Koss made a version of these in an over the ear Circumaural design. It would be nice to hear how it sounded.For a small portable headphone where sound isolation is not required, these are my babies.Here is what I own as of this review, to show you to what Im comparing from.Onkyo TX-SR500 recieverKoss UR29Koss the plugPanasonic RP-HJE50Koss Porta pro (of course)Audio-technica ATH-PRO5V", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best!", "unixReviewTime": 1155168000, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2006"}
