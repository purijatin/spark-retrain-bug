Jiang", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I have been having Grado Labs SR60 and SR80 for a couple of years, but Koss Portapro always rings into my mind as they are much cheaper, and they are supposed to be really good with a sound signature somewhat similar to my Grados.Okay, I finally pulled trigger two weeks ago. My initial impressions are (only burned in for about 10 hours).- Bass is a little too much (that's expected and is a selling point for Portapros). But with EQing, I can make it a bit better to my taste.- Sound is not too clear overall (comparing with Grados of course), but this may improve over time with more burned in (based on my prior experiences).My sources are very decent MP3 players and laptop with external sound card. No external amps were used in any way.In the end, Portapro lives within my expectations. I like them for their compact shape, portability (which Grado lacks), comfort (slightly worse than Grados). I think these are not as good as Grado Labs SR60 and SR80, if a straight comparison has to be made. Value wise, I would go to SR60 if you can buy used. If you only buy new electronics, then these are really good values.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Finally tried Koss Portapro", "unixReviewTime": 1280275200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2010"}
