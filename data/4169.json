Kamplain", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I am very fussy about my music and the headphones that deliver that music must be good.  The sound from these headphones is  crisp and clean.  I sometimes feel like I am in the recording studio because I can hear every little nuance.  The bass is present but not overwhelming.  They are VERY comfortable to have on over long periods of time.  They cover the ear but don't keep you from hearing what's going on around you.  I don't like earbuds but didn't want huge headphones either.  These are just right in size.  They are adjustable both in length and in pressure against the ears.  They fold up for travel.  I have bought other headphones and keep coming back to these as my favorite.  I think the price is incredible for the quality.  I highly recommend them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My all-time favorite headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1392249600, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2014"}
