Yes, I got my hair snagged the first couple times.  Once I figured how to take em on and off it's been no big deal.The sound quality is fantastic.  Bass is present in spades.  Highs are well defined and haven't gotten tinny on me.  I'm not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows I want.  Comfy too.  To the point I despise putting buds on when I workout.  May get a 2nd pair just for working out.  This is one product where the reviews on Amazon are dead on.Can't recommend these highly enough.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible", "unixReviewTime": 1328832000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2012"}
