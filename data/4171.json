I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good headphone for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009"}
