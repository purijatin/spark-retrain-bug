Although not as clear as Bose noise-canceling earphones, you cannot beat these earphones for the money. They work very well with an iPod. The bass is especially good, and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal iPod earbuds. These earphones are well worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Something so good they did not have to change the style", "unixReviewTime": 1232582400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2009"}
