Being on a tight budget, I researched various budget-priced Bluetooth speakers and bought the JBL Flip.  The difference between the laptop speaker and the Flip was, needless to say, outstanding.  So I started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that I could turn up the volume quite high on the Flip without experiencing any distortion.  Unfortunately, my wife wasn't as enthralled as I was with my late night listening habit.  I tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low, but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details I could hear at a higher volume.  Still being on a tight budget, I researched budget-priced headphones and bought the Koss PortaPros.  I can't believe how much better the music sounds on the PortaPro compared to the Flip.  All the raves you read from other reviewers are true, but can you see my dilemma?  The Flip sounds better than the laptop, and the PortaPros sounds better than the Flip.  I'm now thinking that I will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level.  For the time being, however, I'm extremely satisfied with the PortaPros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume I want without irritating my wife.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bad, better, better yet", "unixReviewTime": 1376092800, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2013"}
