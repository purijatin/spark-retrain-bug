SOUND GOOD.I have owned these about a year now.-Well Made-Good frequency response-comfortable-fair price for quality-allow external sounds to be heard (this is good for me, but maybe bad for others)-lifetime warranty with registrationI have a pair of Bose triport headphones, ultimate ears stuido3's, and Shure e2c.  I pick up the portapros every single time by preference.The in-ear type block out other noises if you want that, but for me this is one of the nice features of the portapro.  I can turn the music on medium and still hear if somebody is driving up behind me, trying to talk to me or trying to kicking down my door.  If I set the music low I liken it to having a conversation with somebody and the music is in the background.  As somebody that is very critical of everything I buy, I can say these exceeded my expectations.I thought I would like the in-ear type, but they are uncomfortable and if the seal in your ear canal is not perfect they have very poor frequency response.If you are looking for a nice pair of affordable headphones quit looking and buy portapros.  Once you get them go to Koss' website and register them for a lifetime warranty.  Bam... you are set with great phones for a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Excellent Excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1287792000, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2010"}
