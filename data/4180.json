I have to choose one of them because of limited budget haha. I chose this one because of my friend. He has Koss SportaPro which produces great sound and incredible bass. That's what I want. I'm very pleased with PortaPro. Very nice high and mid-range sound and impressive bass. I didn't say that this headphones are the best because some people still like Sennheiser or AKG. I think it is not much comfortable even if you adjust it to comfort mode. Moreover, even if you fold it, it's still bigger than pouch included in package. However, I chose PortaPro because of sound (and price). If you like powerful bass headphones and very nice high-range and mid-range sound, PortaPro will make you happy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Portapro", "unixReviewTime": 1186963200, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2007"}
