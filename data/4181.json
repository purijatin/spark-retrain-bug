You won't find better sound for this much money. Even if you upgrade to something better, these are good to keep around for working out, doing chores around the house, etc., since they're lightweight and fit pretty snugly. I've owned mine for a year now and they still sound great.UPDATE: I've owned these for more than two years now, and I've treated them like crap -- wearing them when I work out, when I'm doing chores, working on the house, etc. They're INDESTRUCTIBLE, and they still sound great. I've gone through at least three pairs of in-ear headphones in the same amount of time. Buy these -- they'll last you years. You do have to get used to having a line imprinted on your head after using them for more than five minutes at a time, but I guess you can't have everything.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Cheap Headphones Around", "unixReviewTime": 1250553600, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2009"}
