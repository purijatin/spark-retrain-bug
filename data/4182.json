Don't be alarmed at the style of these headphones because they are not the size of those big, closed back reference/Monitor earmuffs. These are the smaller &#34;Walkman&#34; style. I was surprised at the size, because the photos make them seem large. Good bass and treble response, but I can see how they could get broken easily. Just take care of them and they will be OK. A little weird trying to fit on your head for the first time.The package depicted (plastic clamshell) is not the package I received. I received a very nice upscale black box packaging with a photo of the headphones on them (in the style of iPod packaging).Pros - Lightweight and comfortable, even for people with glassesGood soundGreat priceCons- A little flimsy (mostly because of the metal band)Compared to my larger Audio Technica AT-30's they match up well. The main difference is in the bass response and loudness.It takes a little more power to drive the AT-30's so the Koss is louder The closed back of the AT-30's provide a little less treble and more of a &#34;surrounding&#34; live sounding bass compared to the Koss. But it is just a matter of preference. The AT's are also heavier and glass wearers will be hurting for sure. I'll keep the AT-30's for the studio and the Koss for general listening. You can't go wrong with the PortaPro's.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1386460800, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2013"}
