Ingersoll \"Nelson\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "These cans are not as good as my Grado SR80s; however, they are very good.  The bass is realistic.  The highs are crisp.  The midrange is balanced with the bass and highs.  I don't transport them very much; however they do fold up and store quite nicely.  One thing which I consider a real plus is the metal band across the head.  The band makes it absolutely simple to adjust the width, between ears, of the drivers without damaging the headset.  For a set of sub-$50 cans these are a great choice.  I've heard that the KOSS Sporta-pro isn't as good as these KOSS Porta-Pros.  If that is the case I'd stay away from them and get the Porta-Pro instead.  Unlike my Grado SR80s these drivers do not require additional amplification when used with my iPod or iPod Touch.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not great; but very good.", "unixReviewTime": 1264723200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2010"}
