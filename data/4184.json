Im not an audiophile but i really notice the difference, which is big, between these and other headphones. The music played by these can be played at low volumes and i can tolerate. Very clear. One thing though, music is leaked really bad by these after bout 40% wich is bad cuz u know ppl can hear what you hear, and to me i dont like. Its plastic and aluminium, not the most durable of materials but hell with a lifetime warranty whos complaining. Its either these or some 100+ headphones. take these. Your wallet, and ears will thank you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Godsend", "unixReviewTime": 1248739200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2009"}
