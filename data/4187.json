After maybe an hour or so, they begin to really hurt my ears. People rave on here about how comfortable they are, I don't get it. I have an average size head, so I don't think my ears or dome piece is the issue. The circular foam pads around the speakers are very thin and the round speaker pieces underneath have hard edges that press through the foam and onto your ear. After a while it begins to hurt... not like make you bleed and cry hurt, but just slight dull pain from pressure. I have had these for about a year and use them daily at work. I still haven't gotten used to them, I doubt my ears will develop defensive callouses. Other than that, these have good sound and look cool for the money.Edit: I've had these for about a year and a half. I am so-so about them and definitely don't love them. They have not stopped hurting my ears, but I've gotten somewhat tolerable to it. FYI, back then I purchased the Grado SR-60s at the same time, and found them to also have the same super-cheap, extremely uncomfortable padding so I returned them. I kept the Koss phones since they were cheap and didn't require a headphone amp or purchasing an additional plug adaptor.I have been looking for on-ear headphones since then, so if anyone has any recommendations on an upgrade that's COMFY and sounds amazing, I'd love to hear from you. Happy shopping.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great sound for the price, look retro and cool... but...", "unixReviewTime": 1282780800, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2010"}
