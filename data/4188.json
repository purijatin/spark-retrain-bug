The wide metal band is durable but at the same time awkward because it is so wide.  There were only two problems.  One is that it hurts my ears a little.  But that is livable.  The other is that it advertises that it comes with a \"case\" which is actually a cheap plasticy bag that is slightly smaller then the headphones.  I really need a carrying case so I will have to find something else stronger and a little large so I can carry this in my pack without destroying it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value but don't believe the \"case\" it advertises", "unixReviewTime": 1286755200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2010"}
