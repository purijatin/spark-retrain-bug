The midrange is excellent, with instruments apparent I didn't know were there. They are also very light, so if you're confident enough in how they look, you can wear them around.the main point of my review was to say they are iPhone FRIENDLY, atleast the ones I got from Amazon directly.Would definitely recommend if you need something under a hundred dollars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT sound, comfort, and iPhone friendly!", "unixReviewTime": 1229385600, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2008"}
