Hunter \"capandjudy\"", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewtext": "I bought a set of the Koss Porta Pro headphones based on reviews for my Creative Nomad 2C MP3 player which I also got from Amazon. I don't think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the MP3 format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use. Although they are not as accurate as my Grado SR 60 phones, they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go. For small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed. They bass is very good. So good in fact that I turned down the bass EQ on my MP3 player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby. The treble is very clean sounding. If you got an MP3 player, do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these. I am pretty picky about sound quality. The Koss Porta Pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight, portable and delivering a musical experience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For Portable Music Listeners---These  Are A  Deal!", "unixReviewTime": 1060041600, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2003"}
