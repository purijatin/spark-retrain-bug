Yes, they look like a futuristic design from the 1980s--and indeed, they are from the 80s.However, for the price-range (under $60 or so) there is no comparison.  Still none.  These things have been on the market for ages, and folks still rightly rave about them.I remember using these babies on an old Sony Sports Walkman (tape) and the sound was amazing--big, fat bass, and loud.  These are unmatched for bass, period, in portable headphone in this price range.  They put the others to shame.Yes, they are bizarre-looking, and slightly awkward to fold up, and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two.  But if you're more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a Discman or an iPod rather than looking cool on the street with cooler-looking (but inferior) headphones, these things are perfect.  Highly recommended.  No accident that Koss (an American company, no less) hasn't changed up the design of these in ages--they don't have to.  If you want something a little 'sportier' and smaller, try the SportPro.  Not as powerful, deep, or loud, but excellent in their own right.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Blast from the 1980s future", "unixReviewTime": 1110844800, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2005"}
