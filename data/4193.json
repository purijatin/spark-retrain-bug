My biggest complaint is adjusting the fit is tedious.  The \"Comfort Zone\" switch always pops back to the tightest setting unless you first get the headphones situated and then carefully slide the switch while being careful not to bump the pivot point and pop the switch back to firm.  Also, the adjustable headband fights against it's own springiness and it's hard to make it hold at anything other than wide open or completely closed.  Finally, if you slide the headband adjustment while the headphones are on your head, you will almost inevitably pull hair into them.  If you don't plan on folding them up much for transportation, I would recommend looking at a different pair.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great sound but hard to get the fit adjusted right", "unixReviewTime": 1353888000, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2012"}
