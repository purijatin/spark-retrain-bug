Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.PROS- Sound is great, bass and all.- iPod/iPhone friendly plug.- Lightweight and comfortable.- The price is right.CONS- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good.", "unixReviewTime": 1278288000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2010"}
