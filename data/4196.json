Good bass and mid-range sound;  very pleasant sound quality.  Crank up the power and they do not over drive or distort.  These are not sound expert headphones, but they sound as good as or better than the Bose over-the-ear head p[hones I have tried.  They fit comfortably on the ear but will slip some if one moves the head too quickly.  I like the durable head band molded into the plastic.  They fold up very nicely for storage in the bag.  Cord length is sufficient without being too long.  I like them but they were purchased for my grandson; now we will see how durable they are.  Great value for a reasonable price from Amazon.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good sound", "unixReviewTime": 1359849600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013"}
