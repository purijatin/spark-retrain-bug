The sound quality is amazing, clear voice, nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering. To the people saying they feel cheaply made, mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one. They are fairly comfortable for what they are, they fit great under a hoodie, there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level. I highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing Sound, Amazingly Durable!!", "unixReviewTime": 1390176000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2014"}
