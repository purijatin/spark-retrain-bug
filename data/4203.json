They are lighter and smaller than the picture led me to believe, which is a good thing. The side foam pads, for your temples really help keep the pressure off your ear. But this pressure is also adjustable by sliding tabs on the tops of the headphone part. So you can get just the right amount of pressure. The sliding metal bands allow for a large range of size. With the sliding metal bands and a hinged earpieces the unit folds up to a compact size. I really like these but I never give five stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very comfortable, good sound", "unixReviewTime": 1278892800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2010"}
