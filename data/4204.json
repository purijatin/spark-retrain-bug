I read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so I gave them a try.  Wow, the sound that comes from these headphones are great(no static/noise).  The fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size.  I thought the metal would bother me( I shave my head) but no problem here I do not feel them.  If you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound and fit!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1386460800, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2013"}
