My one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as I would like.  Works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit.  Also, wish the headphones were a little more portable.  They don't really fold up as small as I would like.  Lest I sound like too great a critic, I would purchase them again.  In fact, I sent my son-in-law a pair for Christmas.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "very good and short of excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1230163200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2008"}
