The sound's great and they seem to last forever. The other 2 pair? My wife got one and my daughter got the other. They're especially good if earbuds don't work for you ... like they fall off your head a lot.Sennheiser MX-100s have great sound, too, but I had 2 pair of those and in both cases, the sound on one side went out. The first time, I got another pair of MX-100s, but the second time, I got the Porta-Pro. Can't imagine you'd be disappointed with these ... except maybe aesthetically. They do look a bit utilitarian.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Porta-Pro - Always a winner!", "unixReviewTime": 1263081600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2010"}
