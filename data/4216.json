Let me count the ways:This pair of headphones is my favorite pair of portable headphones I've ever owned (just barely edging out my Sennheiser headphones I owned for years). They're highly compact and yet still pack a punch, providing rich full sound and, *gasp*, decent bass output as well (something severely lacking in most headphones). The semi-hard case is also wonderful. I very, very rarely leave the house without these headphones. They fit snugly and are barely noticeable, even after hours of use.My somewhat trivial gripe with this product is that, as a male with short hair, the retractable metal band will pull out a single hair every now and then. Very painful and somewhat frustrating, but not worth taking a star away,My family's been using these headphones for well over 20 years now and I've yet to find much better for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Let me count the ways", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}
