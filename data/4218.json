They will not insulate the surrounding noise like the in-ear type phones, but they sound perfectly - very balanced (enough bass, clear highs and enough mids) and are comfortable to wear. I am finding myself preferring them among the 5-6 sets of different headphones I own for anything on my laptop and on my portable when I am listening to music evenings at home. Highly recommended for any purpose at relatively silent surroundings.edit: One earpiece easily broke when they fell from the table on the floor. Way too easy. Not that durable at the end.
