Sony is not bad, but sounds a little dry and boring. I was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a PC. Bass sounds more natural (not over emphasized as woofers do), and mid-range sounds fuller. Yo-Yo Ma sounds better with this compare to Sony.Even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones, I still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while. I think it is the case for almost any headphone.However, this is not the best for conversation. I prefer my cheapo ear bud for Skype, which sounds a lot clearer. This is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud's frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources.By the way, I got a chance to try a Koss TD-80. This Portapro beats TD hands down in sound quality. If you enjoy music, but not on an AM radio or very compressed files, give this a try.Update: to improve the clarity in conversation (Skype) or vocal, I cut a hole in the center of the foam pad. Now everything works beautifully. By the way, its cheaper to order replacement pads through Amazon. Koss charges $5 for a pair, while Amazon sells a pack for the same price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for the price, realistic reproduction of sound", "unixReviewTime": 1217548800, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2008"}
