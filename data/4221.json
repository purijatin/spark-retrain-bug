They sound really good. The bass isn't overly punchy or  overwhelming but sounds really nice. The whole sound is very clear through the Linkin Park, Incubus, Pendulum, Bonobo, and some other tracks that I've listened to with these headphones.My only complaint is that they feel a bit flimsy and I try to be really careful with them. So far, I've dropped them once and they're fine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect but feels a bit flimsy", "unixReviewTime": 1357516800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2013"}
