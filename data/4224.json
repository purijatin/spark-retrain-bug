A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound", "unixReviewTime": 1140998400, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2006"}
