I bought one years ago - and they worked fantastic until one of the side gave out. That was when I discovered the no-questions-asked lifetime warranty from Koss!I mailed them the piece - explaining what was wrong and about $8 s/h. And sure enough in four days they sent me a new unit!For the one I gifted, I was on the fence about beats, sennheisers, and bose on-ear. Tried them all out and personally I think the Koss ones sounded way better (and looked cooler too). I know the bose fans will hate this - but if they closed their eyes and didnt know which ones they were listening - I bet they would agree Koss sounds better or at least as good as the bose on-ear phones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound and legendary support", "unixReviewTime": 1375660800, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2013"}
