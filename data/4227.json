They were my first good pair of headphones and I still have a pair today.Back when I first got them I thought these were a god send. They simply blew me away. I had never heard a pair of cans with such deep detailed bass. But then again I was used to listening to the cheap stuff that came with Walkmans. So the Porta Pros were a big step up the food chain. More then twenty years later and about five different pairs (the thin wire constantly breaks)they sound a little bass heavy to me now. I now do most of my listening with a pair of Grado SR60's. Much better all around but twice as expensive. My first pair cost me about $50 and that was as in 1980's dollar's. So if you take into account their current price these head phones are a real steal. And remember folks they come with a life time guarantee. The last two times that they stopped working I sent them in. The first time they were repaired. The second time I got a new pair. Not bad. But what they should really do is improve the quality of the wire. Even if it means an extra $5. I would recommend these to most but not to the very active or to folks who tend to break things, like my daughter.Love you honey.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very Nice Cans", "unixReviewTime": 1284940800, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2010"}
