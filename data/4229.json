They've served me well. I purchased them in Circuit City (one of the only local places where one could find them eight years ago) and they have traveled from iPod to iPod, served in some mild studio work, and have basically been the best set of headphones I've ever had. They sound great, they're comfortable, and they are durable.There's not much more to say. They're starting to wear out just now, and I guess I'll be forced to buy a new set from Amazon (or invoke Koss' lifetime warranty) within the next year or two. It's good that they're a bit easier to acquire now, and the price is about right.I'm no audiophile, but I do believe most people will find the Koss PortaPro headphones to be superior to just about anything in the same price range.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Love My PortaPros", "unixReviewTime": 1238889600, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2009"}
