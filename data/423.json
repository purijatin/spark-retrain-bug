My color ebooks look so great on it. The only problem I have is with playing youtube videos. I'm using the link B&N; put on my bookmarks.Other than that though, its awesome. It works really well & haven't had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE:After playing with it a little longer, I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked (such as Sony Touch, kindle and a few others which are all newest models) and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages (ex: google.com) & tap a text box to type something in, my keyboard will dissappear & I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case, I still LOVE it. The color is AMAZING & I can use this for hours! No eye strain trouble here & it is able to read EVERY ebook I load onto it. I haven't had to buy any B&N; books yet because I already owned so many", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love My NookColor!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}
