I can't compare their sound quality to those headphones costing $5-600, because I don't have that sort of cash laying around.  What I can say is that these have a very wide range of frequency response, giving clear resolution to both the highest and lowest tones, and good clarity of vocals.  They are very light weight, and do not exert much pressure on my ears, or anywhere, making them very comfortable to wear for long periods.  And, although built lightly and compactly, they do not appear to be too fragile.  They actually do easily fold up and fit inside of the included 4.5&#34; x 5.5&#34; drawstring bag, making them highly portable.  They are just what I had hoped they would be.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones...", "unixReviewTime": 1384646400, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2013"}
