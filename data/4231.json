Lowe", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Got a couple of these for $25 each and my wife and I use them to watch Netflix and such. They are very good for what they are. Comfortable: secure without being tight. Easy to fold up for protection. Open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching (not possible with higher quality earbuds we have.) Especially if you find them at this price, go for it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sweet", "unixReviewTime": 1395446400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2014"}
