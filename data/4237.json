They're comfortable, and they stay on my head while working out and doing chores that require a lot of repetitive bending, like laundry. But I only bought the pair in Nov 2012. Now here it is June 2013, and one side just died completely. I don't have the \"paperwork\" so the warranty is useless. Lesson? Next time, keep the \"papers\" and register the headset so that if they break again, I have some recourse. Also, the price is now about $5 higher than when I bought them last year.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great sound, my favorite headset, but didn't last", "unixReviewTime": 1370649600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2013"}
