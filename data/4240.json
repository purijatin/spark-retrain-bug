Harke", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "For sound quality, you would be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range. True, there's a few products out there (some Senn earbuds come to mind) but you could spend a lot more and get something that doesn't sound this good. Don't expect any isolation though, these are open to the air (as most of the best sounding headphones are).For comfort, they are so-so. They're not the worst I've used, but the band isn't particularly comfortable. The design is also prone to catch hairs (I have short hair so it doesn't bother me so much, but once in a while it catches one and rips it out).The styling is very 80's, which, well, makes sense, since they were designed in the 80s. I guess that is good or bad depending on what you like.Oh, the &#34;case&#34; they come with is useless. You'll never get them to fit back in the case. I think the bag itself is physically large enough to contain them, but the opening is not.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound quality, so-so comfort", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2013"}
