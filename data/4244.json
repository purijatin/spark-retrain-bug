For the reasonable price, I don't think you will be disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. Also, they can be compactly stored (designed to fold together) and carried within included case.Okay, the bad...They're not the most comfortable \"over-the-ear\" headphones with a pretty tight feel and a bit difficult to adjust. Also, the metal/plastic headband slide has grabbed my hair a bit without following through with a kiss.When I first started using headphones (over 40 years ago now) Koss was the brand to get. This still seems to be true today. Overall, these are very good sounding headphones for a reasonable price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Sounding Headphones with Strange Design", "unixReviewTime": 1333584000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2012"}
