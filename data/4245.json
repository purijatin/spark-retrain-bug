OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible sound.", "unixReviewTime": 1239753600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2009"}
