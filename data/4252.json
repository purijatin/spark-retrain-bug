They are great sounding and quite durable.  They feel kind of cheap but even my 12 and 15 year old sons couldn't break them (they break or lose almost everything i get them).  The most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them. I use my pair with a zune mp3 player.  They blow away the standard ear buds, as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones I bought.  The only complaint I have is the styling.  Since I'm not trying to make a fashion statement, I have to give them 5 stars.Jan. 31, 2012: I have owned these headphones for over 4 years now and I have to say I love them as much today as when I got them.  They have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord.  Where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed.  I remedied this with my hot glue gun.  I was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didn't feel it was worth the shipping costs.  I just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point.  Everytime I go to the store to sample headphones I come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display.  Ive tried the sony's, skullcandy's, klipshe, etc.  The only ones I like better are the more expensive (over $200) sennheisers, bose, bowers and wilkins, and audio technica.  I haven't heard the grado or beyerdynamics headphones so I can't comment on those.  For portable use you would be hard pressed to find a better headphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1255651200, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2009"}
