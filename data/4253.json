Earbuds aren't an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears, and these are just perfect.  The folding design works well in a gym bag, too.Plenty of bass, and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap MP3 player.  I wouldn't mistake these for my dearly-departed Grado SR60s, but they're half the price and much more portable.I had a pair of these in the early '90s, and loved them back then too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect exercise headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1171411200, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2007"}
