I've never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again.  They technically still work, but I broke the connection between the headphone and the head band.I've been using SennHeiser 201HD's at work for a few years now.  BUT the bass was never terribly pleasing.  I had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old Koss Headphones over Christmas.These things are amazing.  The base response blows the Sennheisers out of the water (and yes, I know they are twice as expensive) the comfort unbelievable.  I have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better (TO ME) than the 249.99 Beats they had on display.I gotta say, these things rock. Frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Long time no Koss", "unixReviewTime": 1357689600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2013"}
