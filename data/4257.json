This is by far the best sounding of the group (by far!) and I find myself using them the most often.  As a matter of fact, they sound better than my studio headphones (Audio Technica) that cost about $100 more.  The only problem I have is that they can get uncomfortable after an hour or two of use, and they stick to your hair.  If you have long hair (anything after a 1950's crewcut) they will stick to your hair and pull it when you adjust them and take them off.Totally worth it -- great sound and all -- as long as you don't mind the problem with the ouchy hair...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sound great but a little ouchy", "unixReviewTime": 1049673600, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2003"}
