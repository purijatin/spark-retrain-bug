They designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you're jogging.The sound quality is simply amazing for their price. The design looks sort of dated but that's because they've been produced without change for more then 25 years now.I've bought the same model now to replace the broken once.Highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Proven great quality", "unixReviewTime": 1299110400, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2011"}
