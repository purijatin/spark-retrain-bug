I mean for the money you spend I feel you get more quality sound then not. All ranges sound really good. The low end I felt was really nice to hear. All ranges come out good. About the down side. Well, I don't feel I have room to complain. They have a lifetime warrantee. You don't need any RA#, you mail them to Koss and they either repair or replace It. This was a large part of my deision In buying these. They have short wires and the wires are thin. Would of been nice If they made them with an exrta couple feet of length. You do need care to handle them cuz they seem a bit fragile but so long as you take care they should last.Would I recomend them? Yes I would!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great sound.", "unixReviewTime": 1361491200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2013"}
