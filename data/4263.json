Block", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Bought my first headset by Koss (KTX/PRO) Titanium at least 8, maybe 10 years ago.  Got it at a drugstore for about $15.  It finally failed a week ago.  Not completely, just wore out foam ear covers and developed a spotty wiring problem.  I was faced with replacing the best headset a picky, PICKY audiophile like me could find.  I spent a lot of time reading reviews and bought this one.  And BOY am I a happy camper!  Don't waste anymore time.  Get this headset.  Rich, deep base, clarity, no distortion of sounds in background.  I cannot imagine a headset that could sound better than this one.  It's extremely comfortable.  The wiring is a lot thinner and I may worry about damaging it.  Only disappointment was the \"case\" included.  It's not a case but rather a black bag made of a synthetic material.  I folded the headset to try to use the bag and stopped.  I don't want to cram like crazy and damage the headset to get it in the little bag.  I'll use the bag for other electronic gadgets. My old reliable Koss headset came with a volume control, and this one is missing that dandy feature.  That's the ONLY thing it's missing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Approved by Picky Audiophile", "unixReviewTime": 1256515200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2009"}
