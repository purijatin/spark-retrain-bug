It does output strong bass, but overall sound is muffled. The high is very weak, barely audible. I prefer the Koss KSC75 and Sennhauser PX100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the PortaPro.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not Impressed At All", "unixReviewTime": 1387843200, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2013"}
