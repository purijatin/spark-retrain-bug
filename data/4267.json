These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great choice to replace earbuds", "unixReviewTime": 1213920000, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2008"}
