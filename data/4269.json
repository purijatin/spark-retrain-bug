But they might be the most comfortable.  And the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small.  They are easy to carry around, and I have found them to be surprisingly durable.By comparison I also have the Sennheiser PX 100s.  The Sennheisers are OK, but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled.  I always go back to the Porta Pros.  In fact, no matter what ever headphones I try I always go back to the Porta Pros.These have been around a long time, but no one has yet made a better portable headset.  Usually I don't like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review.  But these headphones are that good, and I recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp3 player.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stand Up to the Test of Time", "unixReviewTime": 1190764800, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2007"}
