However, it is incredible with the new upgraded software that came out at the end of April 2011. You can do email, there are apps, videos are super!!! And there is flash. I also like the fact that I can adjust the brightness of the screen to prevent eyestrain.You can have multiple email addresses on the email account, which is great for me as I have 3 separate email addresses. In an effort to protect my computer from emailed viruses, I am opening my email on my Nook. That way if a virus sneaks in, it takes out a less expensive device than my computer.I also like the idea of being able to subscribe to magazines that are photo intensive and I can actually see the pictures in color.That said, I still like my Kindle ereaders very much for reading books.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible with the software upgrade", "unixReviewTime": 1304899200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2011"}
