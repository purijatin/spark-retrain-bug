But, I have to pay shipping there, and shipping $6 back. So for a $30 set of headphones I have to pay a third of the cost to get a replacement.That said, great bang for the buck with audio quality. Good bass, but clear, not boomy like cheapos. However, the cord frayed within 2 months, and I'm hearing occasional audio go out. I think the quality of the build is a 2 out of 5, but the audio is 5 out of 5. Be aware you are getting a cheaply made product that outperforms the price. I'm personally going to look to switch over to grado's or something that seems more durable.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good product, but beware long term durability", "unixReviewTime": 1278806400, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2010"}
