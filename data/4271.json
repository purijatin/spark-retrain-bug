I use it to listen to itunes on my laptop and it sounds far better than the laptop speakers. It sounds especially decent when listening to jazz, classical music and ballads. DJ/Dance Hall music and the like sounds good too but would sound even better with more bass. The head phones are a very good all rounder. Go ahead and get it if you are on a budget.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of the very best at this price point", "unixReviewTime": 1257033600, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2009"}
