The cord for one thing is a lot more flimsy and thin and there is more plastic.The photograph is showing the OLD model Koss and does not depict the newer version of this same model which is not made as well and was quite a shock when he got them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOT the SAME as Pictured...
