The sound is bright, crisp, undistorted and they are also very comfortable while wearing eyeglasses.I was tempted by Vintage cans like the Sennheiser HD414s but the used prices are a little hard to justify when compared to the Koss PortaPros. The HD414s also need a powerful amp for them to shine and I'm just plugging into my Mac and iPod most of the time.The Koss PortaPros are the ultimate in retro chic and for the price you'd be hard-pressed to find another set that rivals their sound quality and design.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great cans!", "unixReviewTime": 1341705600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2012"}
