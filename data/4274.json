It's firm and light. Solid headbands(metal).Pros :-Cool-Firmness is great! Firm, mild, and &quot;did you see my headphones?&quot;-Portable-Light designCons :-Cheap cord(ask me for a pic)-The plastic on it may seem solid, but drop it once and it breaks! (ask me 4 pic)-Plug in form of &quot;v&quot;. This makes it easy to tear off. (ask pic 2 see difference)-Sound slightly above average, but no competition against PanasonicI really hesitated when I saw it, I knew that it would break. And I was right, a fall of a meter and there's my money flying by. I highly recommend to people who are careful and one last tip, fold the headphones so that it doesn't break! Don't fear breaking it by folding the phones close to the metal bands and bending the thing like a metal bar. I like the design, but I wished that the body was metal only, not plastic!The three stars missing are for the bad cord. It's cheap. You're supposed to be careful and not dropping it once and it's over... otherwise it's a must buy!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Beware : for non-abusive consumers only", "unixReviewTime": 977184000, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2000"}
