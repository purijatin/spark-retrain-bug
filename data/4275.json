Honestly, I think I'm done buying low-priced sets with their fragile construction.  And by this, I mean that (in 100% of the broken cans I've had) it's the wire connection to the plug.What bothered me the most about this set was that I never really used it in any aggressive manner.  It's just time and movement of any kind has weakened that connection.  It shouldn't be the case.Regardless, I'm late to the game on reviewing this product, so I don't expect to change anyone's minds.  If you're in the market for a cheaply made but decent sounding set of headphones to get you through a short-term period, this might be recommended.  For my part, I think it's time to spend more and shoot higher.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sound, poor construction", "unixReviewTime": 1376179200, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2013"}
