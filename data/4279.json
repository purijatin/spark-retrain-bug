They can be used for any genre you can think of. Excellent sound all around and they aren't even burned in yet. Highly recommended for comfort and sound!Update: I am returning these unfortunately. Although they are great, they are not so good for exercising. I didn't even attempt it but if you get sweat inside the ear cushions, it will go straight to the driver. They are great for portable use still as well. They also were a little tight on my head, even with the light mode on. The light mode also wasn't working very well. I have a bigger than normal sized head though. If you have a normal or small head, these would fit great. It just clamped too hard for me. While I still recommend them, they are just made way too cheaply and hurt my head.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent and beat many other headphones in it's range", "unixReviewTime": 1360627200, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2013"}
