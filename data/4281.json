They were extremely popular. Now I know why!The sound quality on these things is amazing, comparable to $50+ headphones. The only headphones I have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive Sennheiser headsets. The bass is really booming, and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange.They are extremely portable too. I can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up.Pretty durable cable too, and it doesn't twist.I highly recommend these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love them!", "unixReviewTime": 1307232000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2011"}
