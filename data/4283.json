After years of loyal service I finally abused my pair to death and I wouldn't order any other headphones to replace them.  They're lightweight and I often forget I'm wearing them. They do great bass simulation and I can hear instruments I can't detect on other headphones.  There are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers.  It has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80's design is kinda ugly.  They have no noise cancellation, so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume, and for something called the Porta Pro, they aren't particularly portable.  They fold up, but they don't fit in your pocket.  Still,  you can't find a better lightweight pair of  headphones in this price range. They work great and except for the occasional hair snag,  they're comfy,  but best of all they won't break the bank to deliver a quality sound.  Take the Pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets.  You'll see there's a reason they've earned a cult following.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Favorite Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1264377600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2010"}
