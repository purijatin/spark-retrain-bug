I got these to listen to music and podcasts and found these handle the full range with out being too bass-y compared to Dre Beats or other high-end headphones. I have found that many high-end headphones bill themselves as such because they can produce a lot of bass, but end up sacrificing range and clarity. I wanted a pair of good headphones and were looking at some sets that were &#62;$150 and decided to take a shot at these.These work for all types of music which I have tried classical, hip-hop, rock and roll, and dub step.I used them at work and a couple of times at the gym with no issues in either arena. They will block out the background noise of the gym and the pads don't soak up sweat like other headphones I have ruined in the past.Two issues are the looks and the comfort. The looks are something you will get used to. I have found that these can get uncomfortable after wearing these for a couple of hoursProGreat soundGreat bassGreat rangeGreat priceConLooksComfort", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1368144000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2013"}
