These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Want to hear everything as intended - then buy this headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"}
