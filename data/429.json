I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the \"color\" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Get a Kindle Instead", "unixReviewTime": 1306627200, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2011"}
