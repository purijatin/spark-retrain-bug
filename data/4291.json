Most of my music I hear is lossless format on IPOD (converted from CD using EAC software). I am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality. I am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones. The bass is well defined.The headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well :-)I will definitely recommend these headphones to friends.Lastly the price just blew me away ! Koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a Music Jedi :-) May the force be with Koss.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clear sounding and very comfortable to wear", "unixReviewTime": 1315958400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2011"}
