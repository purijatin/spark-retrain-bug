I'm amazed that PortaPro are just $30. I own a pair of V-moda in-ear phones that costed me more than double the price, and a pair of Seinnheiser PMX60. I can safely say that PortaPro are FAR superior sounding than the other two. The best part is their bass. Mids and Highs are great as well. Pretty comfortable to wear. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is their 80's look. But headphones are for listening, so I'm over the looks. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1288742400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2010"}
