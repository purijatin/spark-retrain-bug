The sound is phenomenal... I make my friends that have the \"Beats\" and \"Soul\" studio headphones (who also paid $200-$400) listen and they are jealous of the huge sound! Unless you just want to blow your $$ on those to get a rapper's brand name, get these!Summary:PROS:-HUGE soundstage-- great bass, but not overpowering. Good clarity in mids and the highs can sparkle if you want them to, even with bass! Brings music to life--hear it like never before.-Interesting design, get lots of questions/compliments.-PRICE -- are you kidding me, $40 for this high quality? thanks Koss!-comes with decent case and headphones are collapsible to easily carry in a backpack or pocket even.CONS:-cord seems a little short, but not bad. about 4 feet. I'm used to longer cords on studio headphones.-keep in mind these are \"on ear\" therefore let outside noise in a little. Also keep in mind you can turn these up REALLY loud. lol.Highly recommend these little headphones. If you are in the market for anything under $400, get these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1341532800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2012"}
