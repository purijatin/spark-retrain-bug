They are very good and yes they get better after a break-in.For this money they should be on your short list.It appears people have luck with these lasting for years and are a product really worth the price for once.Update 07/2012Holding up and sounding great!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Well done for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1297382400, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2011"}
