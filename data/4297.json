Anderson \"ELECTRONIC GEEK\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I was due for a new set of headphones, and as I despise earbuds, I searched carefully, and found these superb phones from Koss. They are not expensive, yet if you are particular about your music, your  ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce.  I can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the 70's.  They fold closed and come with a leather-like bag.  The bass is clear and not muddy, the highs are clean and not painful to the ear.This model has been in production continiously since 1984 without change!  Koss hit it right with these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Last Headphones you will ever buy!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1279152000, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2010"}
