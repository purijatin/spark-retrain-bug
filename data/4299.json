Yes, they aren't exactly stylish - the design dates from the 1980s and it shows.  But there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years.  You don't survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for it.They aren't perfect for all occasions - I wouldn't go running with them because the old-school foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty.  You could use them on a plane, but they don't have any sound-isolating/noise cancelling features and they don't isolate your ears.  But for like commuting on the subway, at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep, they are perfect.  Good base response, but nicely balanced throughout.  Crisp, not muddy at all.  They hold up well if you don't abuse them, I had a pair years ago and they lasted a long, long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just stop looking and buy these", "unixReviewTime": 1360368000, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2013"}
