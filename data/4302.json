The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Big Sound for the Buck", "unixReviewTime": 1293753600, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2010"}
