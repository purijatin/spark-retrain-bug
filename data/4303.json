I am a fan of really high end headphones (Sennheiser 595s) and, although my Koss phones aren't quite up there with them, they really do satisfy.  Great bass, great presence and you could run over them with a car and they'd still work.  When I bought these (more than ten years ago) the dealer (whom I trusted) said \"these are the best.\"  He was absolutely right.By the way, I recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as Koss Porta Pros.  Happily, Koss hasn't changed a thing.Tom Hurley", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the gym", "unixReviewTime": 1211673600, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2008"}
