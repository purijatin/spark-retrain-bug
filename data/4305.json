I also have a pair of Koss Portapro2s, which are identical to the Portapro other than lacking part of the adjustment mechanism.Despite all this high end audio goodness around, I still use and enjoy the Portapros.  They offer maybe 60% of what my other headphones have, for 1/5th the price (and are much more portable, of course).  I've owned and enjoyed several pair over the years including the Radio Shack iterations, and have always been wowed by the sound quality.  They were my introduction to \"better than stock earbud\" sound.I think they would be a better deal at $20-$25, but they are still worth the money at close to $50.  The bass can get a bit overbearing at times (I'm no basshead), but otherwise they are excellent.  Also, note that they are completely open, and perhaps not the best choice for noisy environments like on a plane or bus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent, a little pricey...", "unixReviewTime": 1136160000, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2006"}
