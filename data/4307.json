Very fold-able / portable. Love-Hate wear procedure - bit of a nuisance: Because of the thin, spring headband, you Must spread out the earpieces all the way (you can't just slip them over your head and ears); wear the headset; and Then tighten the head band and click-adjust the Comfort buttons to get a good fit.  Great $ value with KOSS' Lifetime replacement warranty.  Appeared flimsy on first blush, but on the other hand, it is very flexible and should survive most abuse.  However as mentioned in other reviews, the cable insertion points at the ear pieces do appear vulnerable-fragile and Should have strain-reliefs which is present at the plug-end of the cable (Note for KOSS).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sound is great; Extremely lightweight; Construction durability remains to be seen.", "unixReviewTime": 1379980800, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2013"}
