I've been hearing all my old favorites, songs which I've heard THOUSANDS of times, and in many of them I notice sounds and instruments I never picked up, not in my JBL speakers, not in my old crappy Dell speakers, not in any of the other various headphones I've owned.It is very comfortable to use, very adjustable (it has adjustments on both arc length and speaker angle) and looks durable too, even with all the folding it needs to perform to fit in the small bag it came with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I wish I got one of these when I was a kid", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013"}
