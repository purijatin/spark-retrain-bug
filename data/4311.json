I compared them to a dozen brands they had, including full ear \"professional\" sets like AKG and Sennheiser. As mentioned previously, these have the most incredibly tight and full bass. The tweeters put out crisp, clear highs -- especially brass. I bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day I accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones. I sent it back to the factory with $5.00 shipping and had them back, good as new in less than 2 weeks. The earphone mounting design, while comfortable, is not very sturdy. The earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course.  Well, I broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so I sent them to the factory with $5.00 and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly, good as new.  Bottom line, when Koss says \"Lifetime Warranty\"...they mean it.  I still have them, actually I'm on my third set now and if these wear out, I'll buy them again. Oh, and did I mention they sound great too!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply the best headphones in their class", "unixReviewTime": 1249171200, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2009"}
