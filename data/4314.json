Had my doubts with the Koss brand as I never believed it was a premier brand. The sound is very nice and balanced. Good bass and not overwhelming. The design is a little outdated but I grew up in the 80's so it is fine with me. In fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Amazon Instant Video. Good bang for your buck and definitely a true value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "True Value", "unixReviewTime": 1345161600, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2012"}
