The PX-100s were great, but with the success of that product Sennheiser changed the headphones somewhat and jacked up the price so I figured it was time to tryout their Koss counterparts. I'm a big fan of the PortaPros, they have punchy bass, mid-range is good and the treble is not too piercing. The result is a very good product, though I have to admit I don't like the sound quite as much as the Sennheisers. I think that the main problem is the bass, it's good, but the Sennheisers had a dynamic, fat bass sound that the PortaPros can't quite reach.  I'm a fan of a variety of music, and in rock and jazz tunes this slight deficiency is not apparent at all. With electronic music and, in particular, hip-hop, the limits of the bass show up. I should say that I do have perhaps an over-fondness for low-end sounds so it's possible that you'll like the fact that the bass isn't as strong with the PortaPros.  I will also say that while I don't like these PortaPros quite as much as the PX-100s, I don't think that the PX-100s are worth their new $50 price tag and I would purchase these Koss headphones again if giving the choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Headphones for a Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1347580800, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2012"}
