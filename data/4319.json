I can wear them for hours without problems.  The bass is surprisingly decent for those few songs that need it.  I like the open ear design for use at work as I can hear when people are talking to me.  The whole package is much smaller than it seems in the pictures with the ear pads just barely covering my ears.My biggest complaint is with the portability, or rather the compromises made for that portability.  They fold up decently small and very easily.  This ease means that all adjustments that you make are immediately reset when you take the headphones off your head, even for a second.  Since I use these at work, I just keep them at my desk and don't need them to fold up.  I'd rather that they didn't so I could adjust them exactly how I want and never have to bother again.EDIT October 2013: I've had these since July 2011 and they still sound great, but I have run into a few issues.-They tend to unfold in my bag if I take them with me.  Not a big deal, but it tends to tangle the cord when that happens.-The plastic pieces that hold the two halves of the metal headband together started to unsnap and fall apart.  It was annoying to keep putting them back together, but some superglue has fixed the problem.-After 1.5 years, the cushions have fallen apart.  They're pretty thin to begin with, so no real surprise, and replacements are under $5 for three pairs, but kind annoying.Still, I'd buy another pair if I had to.  Maybe a non-portable version.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Value", "unixReviewTime": 1311552000, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2011"}
