I listen to death metal, classical, jazz, classic rock, trance, ... and these do all of them justice. Mid-range guitars don't sound muddy, bass is punchy (could be a bit bass heavy for some) and highs are not screechy at all.The thing is, the design hasn't changed a whole lot since the 80s when they were first introduced. They are open-air headphones, meaning that they leak sound...both ways. So don't wear these on a subway or in a loud area, as they do not block out sound at all.The adjusting mechanism hasn't affected my hair as much as others here, but it is still an issue. Extend the phones beyond your head size, then adjust down. This way your hair won't get pulled out as often.The cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them; I've knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and haven't had any problems.With regards to comfort, I wear glasses, and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face. Not comfortable at all. These, thanks to those weird-looking comfort pads above the &#34;ear&#34; pads, don't.Other headphones tend to make my ears heat up. Not these.Overall, a great pair for the price, and the portability just makes them that much better. 5/5.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Portable Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2014"}
