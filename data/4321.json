I compared it to my full size Sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great. When playing various styles of music you'll find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music, but it was no slouch on the classical side. It really brought my laptop to life, whether it was music or a movie. I would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair, but that wasn't too diffucult. My son tried it and he wanted to trade the Sony's I gave him, I told him he was out of luck!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1271289600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2010"}
