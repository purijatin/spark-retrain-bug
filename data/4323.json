So used, when I asked to borrow them to verify sound issues or find some resolution to the issues mentioned, they have not been produced so I can assess what's up.  If they sounded that bad and were that annoying, then I would have handed them to me for a return the first week.  She hasn't even managed to give them to me to check them out and now I can't return through Amazon.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not living up to the hype", "unixReviewTime": 1359590400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2013"}
