They are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time.  Dislikes;  I don't like having to adjust them each time I put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts. The cable is a little short for me but works. I would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connector.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You won't believe these Headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2013"}
