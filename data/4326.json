I didn't find PortPro very comfortable, they press against ears a bit too hard for my taste, so I couldn't wear them for too long. But! The drivers can be easily detached and attached to KSC75's clips! This combination turned out to be very comfortable. Why not just buy cheaper KSC75 then? Well, the sound of PortaPro drivers is a step up. Unlike some other reviewers state, as far as I can tell, the PortaPro drivers are the same as KSC35 and NOT KSC75. They do sound different (to my ear), with PortaPro/KSC35 being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich, warm, bassy (is there such a word?) sound I like so much about KSC75. You may also consider KSC35 which is basically PortaPro drivers with clip-on instead of headband (as far as I can tell Koss only sells them directly from their website).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}
