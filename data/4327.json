They are still great.Bought a pair for me in October 2013, and they are trash.Koss changed the molded connector from a strain-reliefed right angle stereo mini plug to a straight one.The wire insulation separated just outside the molded strain relief.If yours arrives with a straight connector, SEND IT BACK.We are very easy on there... use them to listen to iPads in bed. That's it.Very disappointed with new production.So I read that Koss has a warranty; just send them in WITH $9!$9 for return shipping?That covers the total production cost including return shipping.The connector overmolding is no better than a $1 set of ear buds from epay.I'm replacing them with Sennheiser PX 100-II. Thanks Gizmodo.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "New production is crap... changed connector style... insulation separated.", "unixReviewTime": 1390608000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2014"}
