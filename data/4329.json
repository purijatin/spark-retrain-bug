From AKG, Sony, B and O, Bose, Senheiser and among others (such as the overpriced Beats by Dr. Dre)  After listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality, price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point. For less than $50 including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to. With the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources. I don't abuse headphones so these will last me a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sonic quality on a budget!", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}
