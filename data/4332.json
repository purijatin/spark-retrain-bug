After reading so many positive reviews and saw it on sale for under $25, why not? I am so glad I did, the shipping took longer than expected, about 2 weeks but it's worthy of the wait. IMO, this little headphone sounded better than Beats and Sol at a fraction of cost. I am a little picky about audio sound and wouldn't buy a car without a great audio system, skipped Bose, went  for HK Logic 7 for my car. Love this little Koss and highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "amazing little headphone!", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}
