I have had a pair of PortaPros since 1998. I use them everyday to go to work on the trains. I literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use. The great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something, they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to Koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6. I have done this about 5 times in 9 years. Try that with Sennheiser!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Porta Pro Rocks", "unixReviewTime": 1245456000, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2009"}
