You should be using these for a study, or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place. These are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud, and hurt your ears. But anyway, these are nice. Found em via Cnet. Easily fold up, but don't realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it. As for comfort, you can't even tell they are there. As for sound- great highs, and not bad lows- all around goodness. Lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about 10 or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on. Just 9 or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven't had to do it yet, but it is there when i need it. All and all, awesome.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sounding and comfy", "unixReviewTime": 1348185600, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2012"}
