They are durable.-I put them in my backpack with huge math books every day for school.-I have spilled coffee on them.-I have kicked them, and pulled on the cord with my feet by accident.-My fat friend stepped on them.-They have dealt with volume spikes and loud sounds.After all of this they look and work perfect.2. They sound great!-I own a pair of 8\" studio monitors, professional stuff. These don't sound quite as accurate, but I still choose UR20's over my monitors a lot of the time, and enjoy the UR20's immensely.They are durable and sound great, what more could you want? :DPlease rate this review as helpful, otherwise, leave a comment letting me know how my review could have been more helpful.
