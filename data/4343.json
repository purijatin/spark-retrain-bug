I bought a pair of audiotechnic m50s after reading all the great reviews, and guess what?  I like the Koss UR 20s BETTER.  I was shocked.  Yes, the audiotechnics unquestionably separate the different instruments better, give a crisper sound overall with a slightly punchier base and cleaner treble (for $100+ more they ought to, but the mids are quite recessed and the music more sterilized and not really more enjoyable to listen to, and more than anything, they weren't even close to as comfortable as the Koss ur 20.  They began to become uncomfortably hot like an ear sauna after about 15-20 minutes, and the overall enjoyment of listening wasn't $100+.  I sent them back immediately and am listening to music right now on my Koss ur20s.For $15...  and needing them for just listening to music or movie watching, I just can't even think of a reason not to have a pair of these for around the house or at the computer.  So comfortable I could sleep in them, sound is good with these huge cans, and no ear sauna.  While true audiophiles may need to look elsewhere, They are great for everyday listening and use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SHOCKING value, comfort, and quality sound", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}
