I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these. Other than that small inconvenience, I would highly recommend these phones, particularly to people who don't place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound. As a matter of fact, I am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Bass and comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1128729600, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2005"}
