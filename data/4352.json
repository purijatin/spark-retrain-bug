It is light, and you can wear them for hours without feeling pinched.However, it is made out of cheap hard plastic.  The first pair broke after a year, and its replacement just broke again.  So on average each pair lasted for about a year.  Both time, the plastic pieces broke and the headphone practically flew apart.Good thing is Koss offers lifetime warranty, $6 for each repair.  The downside is shipping it back to them is not cheap, and you will be headphoneless for 2-3 weeks.  I think I will use the cheapest US mail to ship it back this time.I will use my PRO4AA while the R80 is in the shop.  The PRO4AA is heavier, but also much more durable, the parts are all aluminum.  Unfortunately, it does not sound as good and it pinches my ears quite a bit for long duration listening.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sounds good but it is made of cheap plastic that breaks often", "unixReviewTime": 1166659200, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2006"}
