Mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding sounds.I have been using mine at work every day of the week. They are just as good as the day i bought them.  I have dropped them a few times but they don't seem to care.If these ever break i will buy another pair. Good value for the price.(Updated)I have now had these for a few months. (Using them right now as I type) I use them everyday at work, I drop them regularly, and they look and work as good as the day I bought them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Look funny but work good", "unixReviewTime": 1355443200, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2012"}
