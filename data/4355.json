Great Bass,sound quality was above standard for the price. But I cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the faulty construction. The plug-in bent almost right away distorting the sound almost the first week I got it. I didn't have an option at the time so I used them tell I found my earbuds. Then they broke again completely severing the right side of the headphones from the rest of it. Don't buy it. Oh yea, went on vacation forgot about the return policy time (my fault) then boom. I got stuck with broken headphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "These are adequate with faulty construction.", "unixReviewTime": 1318291200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2011"}
