I was ready to order a Kindle, sight unseen, because anything that sells that well with so many rave reviews has to be good. Then I went to a local \"big Box\" store that carries the Kindle and the NookColor and seeing the fantastic color screen of the Nook sold me on that one.  Nothing against the Kindle but the NookColor brings childrens books (I have a 4yo granddaughter) and magazines to life.The Nook has a few quirks but none are deal breakers.  If you can, take one for a test drive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The color screen sold me", "unixReviewTime": 1302048000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2011"}
