I bought this for my nephew to use with his Christmas Kindle HD. I chose this due to reviews and because it seems durable for a child (which it really is). Very flexible, comfortable, really long cord. Sound sound is good for the price just don't expect something outstanding for the size. But for simple video games and movies/music that you don't plan on playing at ear bursting levels...this performs very well. I will easily recommend over cheap earbuds. Something to travel with that is comfy, sounds decent, won't break, and you won't cry over if lost/stolen.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Hey, it's $16", "unixReviewTime": 1389312000, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2014"}
