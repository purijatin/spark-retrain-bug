The over-the-ear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in.  Perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of Bose, but eminently reasonable for hanging around home.  A great bargain to boot!  Thanks Koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2014"}
