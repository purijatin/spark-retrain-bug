The drivers are huge, and so are the headphones themselves. These are insanely comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use.Audio quality is the major problem here. These sound very sub-par compared to other headphones in this price range. I would not recommend these whatsoever.If you are looking for headphones in this price range, I would go for the Monoprice 8323. Best headphones you can get under $50.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good, but there are much better headphones in this price range.", "unixReviewTime": 1351555200, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2012"}
