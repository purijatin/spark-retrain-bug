I have to say these are way better than one would think. They live up to the Koss name all I can say. Oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong. The bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum. The only thing I don't like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my taste.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super clear and good bass!", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}
