The sound is rich, full, and clear. The bass is deep, the treble sparkles, and the noise-cancelling pads keep everything going in the right direction. You can really enjoy the music while those around you are going about their own affairs.Unlike so many lower-priced models, the volume is more than adequate. I'm using them right now, and I've had to turn the sound down three times since the music began. With other sets in the same price range, you can crank the sound up as far as it will go, and it's still barely audible. The Koss UR-20 really gets the job done.The headband is comfortable, and the weight is not outrageous. You're always aware that you have them on, but it's neither unpleasant nor distracting. The one downside is that over time (and I've had mine for years,) the pads shed a bit, tiny black particles of vinyl flaking off. Once they're completely gone, the cloth beneath still holds up well. It's actually more comfortable without the vinyl coating.I use these headphones every day, sometimes for hours at a time, and they are still going strong. I couldn't be more pleased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Sensational Sound for the Money\"", "unixReviewTime": 1376006400, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2013"}
