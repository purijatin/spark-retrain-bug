They are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit. Although I have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where it's out of the way. These are EXACTLY the same as what other retailers offer, but without the camouflage, for $30 less. Oh, and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly, windy weather. The only negative I can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesn't get stiff in cold weather. If they did that, I'd give them 6 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Metal Detecting Phones for the MONEY!  (.)", "unixReviewTime": 1387584000, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2013"}
