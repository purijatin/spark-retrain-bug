The headphones are well made and the sound is ok, but the fit is poor. They cover my entire ears, but they don't fit snugly against my head. They're loosest at the bottom of the earcups, at the bottom of my ears. A little adjustment of the width is possible, by bending the two wires seen at the top of the image, but it doesn't affect the tension, which is the issue.As such, now I have music, with just as much hacking and coughing and snorting and throat clearing and other mucousy sounds.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok sound, poor fit on a smallish ladyhead", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2013"}
