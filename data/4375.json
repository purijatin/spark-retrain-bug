I was tired of my son breaking my expensive headphones and decided to try these as they looked industrial strength.  They do the job and didn't cost that much.  You will have to adjust the equalizer settings on your PC or whatever you use these for as they don't seem to be quite right with the neutral settings of most devices.  I like the wire on one side only, but I don't care for the constant adjusting that is required; they seem to reset to shorter way more easily when I set them down than when I try to lengthen them when putting them on.  I also don't care for the bulkiness; it would seem that they would be somewhat noise canceling just by the size, but no such luck.  For the money though, they work as well as could be expected.Update August 30, 2013: So much for durability; used them today and they broke. The size adjustment things on the head band broke.  I am careful with my usage of anything I buy and am very disappointed with only 2.5 months of use.  A close look at the adjustment fittings show that they are of low quality.  Definitely will never buy Koss again.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Upon further review", "unixReviewTime": 1377561600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2013"}
