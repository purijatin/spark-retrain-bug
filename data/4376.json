Unless this is user error, I dont think I need to tune my comp to sound right.....however on a plus for these, they are very comfortable to wear, and they are BIG headphones, also the bass is pretty, good. After all I guess you get what you pay for. I wish I didnt have to edit the sound, it sounds like im outside of a techno club listening through a wall, the sound doenst sound like im right there so to speak. I had to tune the 16khz up pretty much and the 1, 2, 4, and 8 up a bit, to make it sound right. The lower end just a touch for a tad more bass. Other then that theres my review 3 stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "They Are Ok", "unixReviewTime": 1304899200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2011"}
