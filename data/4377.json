I don't notice any ear fatigue at all. They are tuned for a little extra bass which some may not like, but this is one of the reasons I chose Koss.  Essentially they always have the &#34;loud&#34; turned on.  I don't turn the volume up very loud, but I still want to feel the kick drum and bass guitar when playing music.Additionally, the other frequencies are still heard.  Voices are easily heard.  For $15 these are excellent headphones.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the cord maintains the shape it was in from the box too long.  It doesn't forget that it was folded and that is easily forgiven considering the price paid.  They are big but I listen to these at home when the kids are asleep and I don't want to wake them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Koss UR-20 headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1357430400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2013"}
