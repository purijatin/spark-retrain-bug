Gross Georg \"imgeorg\"", "helpful": [77, 91], "reviewtext": "I've had mine for three years now, and I find the UR20s indispensible, since I live in an apartment and can't turn the TV up to a decent level otherwise. There's reasonable bass; you would expect so for the size of them. Always look at the specs. The low number is the bass, the high number (usually in the tens of thousands) is the treble. This set's bass is 30 Hertz. That's That's not a bad number; 20 is average, 12 would be phenomenal. The treble is set at 20,000 Hertz. Theoretically, only dogs can hear frequencies above that, but I think a headphone with a figure over that just seems to sound brighter in the treble, which is what I like. I hate unclear treble and muddy, distorted bass. Another number you look at is sensitivity; the better ones are always over 100. So, I guess based on the specs, these 'phones are about average.The cord length is excellent at 8 feet. I can be a reasonable distance away from the TV without straining the cord; I've even slept with them on without ear fatigue.These headphones make movie watching a whole new experience...you get surround sound without the expense!I've had a great experience with the UR20s and I recommend them for use with home theater, even if you just have a 20&quot; portable like mine. You need an adapter to plug them into a home stereo, and there's plenty of cord where you can be either reasonably mobile or you can sit in your favorite chair some distance away. I think they're great. The only thing that would make them the best is better specs, and that's hard to find at this price range.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Stereo TV/DVD watching", "unixReviewTime": 1071014400, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2003"}
