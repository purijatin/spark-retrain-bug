You can't beat this quality of this headphone for this price. I have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can't match koss. I love them and yes I would recommend!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "EXCELLENT HEADPHONES R-10", "unixReviewTime": 1322006400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2011"}
