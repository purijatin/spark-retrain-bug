Good volume and tone, extremely comfortable ear cups and head band, blocks out background noise very well. You'd have to spend double or triple the cost to get a better sounding pair.The only change I'd make is a better adjustment mechanism. The present design &#34;locks&#34; into position when the cups are spreadapart, as soon as you take them off they're free to slide out of adjustment. My solution was to twist tie the top of the plastic yolks tothe two wire bars so there is always tension on the locking mechanism. A spring loaded &#34;T&#34; shaped bar could do the same and be adjustable for a small cost increase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value!", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}
