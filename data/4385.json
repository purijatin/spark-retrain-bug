Lail", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "I read one review that said \"Koss Warranty a Joke\"I am not sure how the warranty is these days, but it used to be great.I bought a pair of \"Sear's branded\" Koss headphones so many years ago I can't even remember what decade it was. When I bought mine, there was a one year warranty.After several years of hard use, the cord messed up, one of the ear pieces had broken loose, and a couple of wires had broken from the ear pieces. All of this was my fault. I couldn't bring myself to throw them away, so I stuck them in the closet.Several years later (probably 15 or more years), when Koss announced the change in their warranty, I sent these things in (at my cost - didn't cost but a couple of bucks) hoping they could be fixed.Within a few weeks, I got my headphones back in like new condition. Koss paid for the return shipping. My headphones have to be at least 30 years old now, and still going stong. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "30 years old and still going strong!", "unixReviewTime": 1359331200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2013"}
