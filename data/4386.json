Seriously, the picture does not prepare you for how large they are.  But, their large size helps to the be very comfortable.The sound is not as good as I was hoping.  Things tend to sound a little mushy through them to me.  But, for under $20, you won't find anything better.  Based on prior experience with Koss earphones, I'm expecting these to last a very long time.Their large size and lack of audio isolation makes them best for use in the home.  I use mine for computer games and watching movies on my laptop.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1383264000, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2013"}
