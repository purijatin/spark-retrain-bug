I use them mainly to listen to movies through my audio system.  I'm not an audiophile, but I like the sound I get out of them.After only a year or so, the plastic frame that holds the ear cup cracked and broke.  I put some epoxy in it and kept using it because the speakers still sounded fine.  After a few more years, the \"leatherette\" padding started flaking and leaving little black specks on my ears.  Fast forward a few more years and the smooth coating had completely flaked off, leaving a comfortable, fuzzy fabric.  Koss should have used this fabric to start with.  I didn't have any more problems from them until the right speaker started cutting out a few days ago.  It's now time to use the lifetime warranty and get them replaced.  Oddly, it will cost almost the same to mail them in and pay the $9 processing fee as it will to simply buy a new pair from Amazon.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Solid performer with early durability problems", "unixReviewTime": 1375574400, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2013"}
