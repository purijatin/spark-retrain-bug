I can assure you that the item which Amazon just shipped me does not have a detachable cord.Amazon's description also suggests \"and 6.3 mm (1/4-inch) screw-on type adapter\" is included.  It is not in the product.  However, that is not a deal breaker; I have a few of these laying around.Sound quality is good, and the fit is good for my large head, and does a good job (but not excellent) of isolating outside noise.I'm still debating whether to return these to Amazon because of the cord not being detachable; it was one of the primary reasons I wanted to purchase this set of headphones.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "OK full size headphones.  Cord is not detachable.  No 1/4\" adapter in package.", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}
