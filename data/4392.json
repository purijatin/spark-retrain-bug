The problem with my HD202's and many other headphones (I owned many) is that I would lose sound in one of the ears after a long period of time. (usually after 8-12 months) I found out that due to twisting wires (I would wrap my wire around the headphones after use) it could damage them and the special coating inside them.This is one of the reasons I love these headphones. There is a coiled wire, and it's only attached to one side. Very clever indeed Also, the wire isn't a ridiculous 6ft. long. The construction of them is plastic, so it doesn't feel the strongest. (My first pair arrived damaged and I had to get a replacement)Sound quality is usual. Nothing outstanding, but it's not terrible, believe me, it has quality sound. Just don't be expecting Bose quality.It fits my head nicely. For the price, I recommend these to anyone who wants some great headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Quality Cans", "unixReviewTime": 1340496000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2012"}
