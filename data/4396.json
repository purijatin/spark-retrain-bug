He loves to listen to music at a crazy volume, and these protect his ears while muffling the sound for those of us working near him.  Plus, the cord is long enough so that he doesn't have to sit right next to the stereo, and he can move without fear of the bit being ripped out.  Can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My dad LOVES them!", "unixReviewTime": 1358640000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2013"}
