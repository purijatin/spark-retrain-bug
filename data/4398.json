Bought these for him for the computer....he LOVES them.  I tried them, too.You can't hear anything else (like the kids - YAY!!  - LOL)  but your music and the quality of the sound is excellent.  Are these as good as $200 headphones?  No, probably not (I can't afford to even try out a pair of those) but for the money I'd say you can't go wrong with these.My husband says anything made by Koss is great, and these prove it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My bass playing music freak husband loves them", "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012"}
