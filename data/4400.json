I totally recommend them, just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok, if all you want is to listen music, or just watch movies with these, they are great..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013"}
