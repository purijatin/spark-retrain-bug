I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big Ear Cups", "unixReviewTime": 1399766400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2014"}
