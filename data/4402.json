Cortez \"Vintage Hi-Fi\"", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewtext": "I recently purchased a pair of the Koss R80 and all I can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones. The problem is the cord was defective on both pairs I ordered (I had to replace the first pair), the right channel would cut in and out. I wish I could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but I can't. I would avoid the Koss R-line of head phones and look else where.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Great Sound too bad they're defective.", "unixReviewTime": 1263859200, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2010"}
