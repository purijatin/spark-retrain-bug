Not only do they sound great and block a large amount of ambient sound, the single cord on the left side is nice and thick.  We don't have to worry about the chair rolling over the cord.  The chair could probably roll over it a few dozen times with no fear of breaking.  For the price, this is a wonderful sturdy set of headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome for our 7 year old.", "unixReviewTime": 1355788800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2012"}
