The sound is pretty good, but I personally feel like the Bass is lacking. It's ok I guess. I love the cord length. My previous headphones had a real short cord, so this cord is a WELCOME change (I think it's 8ft). I kinda wish that the cord came out of the right speaker, but that's just splittin' hairs. It's good at blocking out most outside sounds (when my mp3 player is turned all the way up), which is great, cause my house is like American Idol...People singing ALLLLL the time. It's SO annoying!! So I bought these specifically to block them out. For the price, I guess I can't expect much more. These headphones are pretty good.Some things I wanna add to this review. The cord is thick. I don't know how important that is, but there it is. These headphones are kinda annoying cause you have to readjust them every time you're about to listen to music.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "For the price, I can't really complain...", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2011"}
