Years ago you had to pay a lot to get a descent set. As the products got better you have ear buds that sound incredible and you can buy a cheap set of headphones for 6 dollars that sound really good but there overall range is limited and they are not very comfortable to wear.  I have owned Sennheiser wireless headphones that I paid 120 dollars for and I don't remember anything that sounds as good as these and are as comfortable to wear.  As far as I am concerned anybody who can't appreciate the quality of these headphones for 3 times the price is just being picky.  I would recommend these Koss UR-20 to anybody.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT DEAL!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "UNBELIEVABLE", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014"}
