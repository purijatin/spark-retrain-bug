I bought them for my teenage kids, but have swiped a pair since they block outside noise great and the sound is just awesome.However, they are huge.  I didn't think they would be that big and that is the one reason my daughter doesn't much care for them.  They are quite comfortable and don't seem to give me a headache like others do.  If the size (covers whole side of head) doesn't bother you, they are great. They could adjust a little more, as in the headband part could go a little taller and then they would be just perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Huge but good!", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"}
