I got them in 2 DAYS!!! And they were worth every penny! These R-10's are amazing.This is what I wanted for a pair of headphones:-Good bass-Comfortable fit-Not bulky (I hate headphones that pop out of my ears 4 inches)-Cheap but awesome.The R-10's fulfilled all of these. The only complaint I have is They're sound is a little muffled... But don't let that intimidate you! You get used to the sound quality in 2 hours of use. They are excellent and look very nice around your neck. Also a little tip! Wear them around your neck and turn up your audio. There! You can even use the headphones when they are not on your head! These are a wonderful buy on every level. And I should know, I am a music producer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss R-10's rock!", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2012"}
