Here's why:* The bass/mid/treble balance is off; low midrange is a bit quiet* The seal on the headphones is not good at all, so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing* The flexible design does not always align itself properly* They require quite a  lot of power from portable devicesSo, there you have it. These are good headphones in their price range. However, if you're willing to pay a bit more (perhaps some $20-$30 on Sennheisers or Sonys), you'll get much better bass/mid/treble balance, better build quality (not necessarily better sound quality, though), and generally a better seal around your ears. Also, you're almost always going to get better bass with in-ear earbuds at this price rangeStill, if $15 is the max you're willing to pay, these should do the job pretty well. Just remember, these are not professional-quality headphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1280016000, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2010"}
