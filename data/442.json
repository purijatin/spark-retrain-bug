I tried to help him use the product thinking that i'm a reasonably educated person.The main problem that we had was trying to read Google ebooks in pdf format. I tried different methods. Downloading directly didn't work. And they will tell you this too as their help desk told me. And downloading it from a pc and transferring it.Even after going to a Nook kiosk, they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support. Apparently they just don't work.This whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustrating.Other huge negatives. Not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesn't doo much for you and isn't that simple to use.My advice. Get a refurbished iPad. You'll be happier for the small price premium over a nook color. It does so much more and is worth the price.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Why would you get this.", "unixReviewTime": 1308700800, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2011"}
