You can't find anything else that sounds this good in this price range. Koss does stereophones right!I have had my UR-20s for more than a year. They still sound great and have been stuffed into my backpack almost every day since i bought them. One of my size adjuster clips has broken, but it is no doubt due to my reckless use. Even broken, they fit comfortably on the head.The ear cups are big enough for anyone's ears. They cover your ear completely and do not &quot;crowd&quot; your ear like the smaller UR-29s do.The bass is amazing and the insulating ring makes such a close seal with your head that you will not hear anything while you have these headphones on. I don't like listening to music while I sleep, but I have used these headphones as noise reducers (without playing any music) on many occasions and bus rides.Note that these headphones are larger than most. This is probably why they sound so great. I especially like that the headband is made of rubber coated metal to keep the phones close to your head, with a cloth balancing strap below that to make it comfortable in any situation.Koss is the king as far as affordable, amazing stereophones go. Buy the UR-20s and you'll be glad you did. I have had no problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1074816000, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2004"}
