They're EXTREMELY comfortable, but just a tad lacking in the sound range.  I wouldn't recommend them as a primary set, but as a backup to go mobile with, they're not bad, if you don't mind the size.But I just can't say enough about the comfort.  They're awesome.  I guess I've got big ears, because most headphones mash them against my head.  I can put these on and they sit AROUND my ears, not against them.  Good and comfortable for long listening periods and while it the cups don't completely block out background sound, they do allow you to focus on what you're listening to fairly well in a noisy situation.For a sub-$20 set of phones?  I'm happy with them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Incredibly comfortable, just a tad lacking on sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}
