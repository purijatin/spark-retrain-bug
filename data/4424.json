But im the type of guy that goes for the best quality at the best price and these fit the bill. Produces nice clear sound and actually has some bass to it. the phones cover my ears entirly which is what i wanted since im using these in my bedroom to listen to tv while my girlfriend sleeps and theres normally fans or a air purfier on. Work great. I did use them on a plane ride and found that the small earbuds the plug your ear canal shut out way more engine noise. So in that case make sure the device you are using can out out some high volume or you may not be able to hear clearly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Glad i bought these and not some super expensive pair.", "unixReviewTime": 1356480000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2012"}
