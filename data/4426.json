It actually doesn't sit on my head right, but I think it's either because I have an oddly shaped head or because I stretch the cord out really far when I listen and it's like tugging on it a little bit.  Just a little.  Great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly.  I drop them a bunch too, so they're pretty sturdy.  Also they are the color of black which reminds me of space, which is cool.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hedfone", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}
