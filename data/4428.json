Superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise.The 8-foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups. After more than 15 minutes of wear, cups tend to go sweaty inside. It would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Superb Bass Response", "unixReviewTime": 1124064000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2005"}
