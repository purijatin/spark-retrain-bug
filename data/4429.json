These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design. The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head. It has a coiled cord which can be removed. The cord is connected like a phone card.Right when I put these headphones on I heard immediate sound difference. I use these on my computer through my Audiy 2zs. Very nice strong midbass and low bass. It hits the notes clean and clear. Never thought how great these would sound for the price. A very clean sound and strong bass. It's also very light. The only thing I dont like is the shape of the earpieces. The design needs to slim the headphones down a bit. For the price this is one nice headphone that will LAST. My Koss UR20 still work after 4-5 yrs of abuse. I just needed to replace them. Get this Koss R-80 and you will be glad. Super fast Amazon free shipping also!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1153699200, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2006"}
