I was not expecting a super audio performance out of hphones, especilaly listening to a portable MP3 source.  However, the sound quality blew me away.  The bass response is tremendous, and there's absolutely no reason to increase the bass boost on the player.  It's an awesome little product.The only downside is the design - in trying to retrofit the Portapro to an updated \"behind the head\" fit, the Sportapros are a bit cumbersome to wear.  It's best to wear them in a traditional over the head fashion.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sound is awesome, but fit is awkward", "unixReviewTime": 1053648000, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2003"}
