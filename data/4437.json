Borges Jr. \"ajb\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic sound and great quality", "unixReviewTime": 1346025600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2012"}
