They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads.  I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 972691200, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2000"}
