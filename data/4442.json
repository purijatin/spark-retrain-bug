They are basically the Porta Pro's but the &#34;gym/sport&#34; version. The lows frequency is strong, and the highs are adequate, the way I like it. Sometimes they can get a little bass heavy but it mainly depends on what your listening too. Since I am listening to mostly heavy music, I don't have to face the bass issue much, but can enjoy the great highs that come with the package.As far as comfort; using these in the gym when I first got them, was a bit of a hassle, mainly due to the fact that I was wearing them wrong. I watched a video on how exactly the headband actually clips backwards behind your neck and tightening the temple cushions to situate the headphones. From that point the comfort level was perfect for me to enjoy these headphones while I work out.The only issue I have with these headphones is the foam cushions start to feel uncomfortable during the end of my workouts. They start to get soggy and make my ears itch while I am trying to finish the last 30-45 of my workout. Other than that, I love wearing them in the gym.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality Koss Sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1369267200, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2013"}
