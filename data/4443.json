I've purchased several in-ear headphones, some designed for sports, and either the cord would transmit feedback when it would hit my body, or I was constantly fiddling with the buds staying in my ear canal. If you can get past the dork-factor of these Koss, they'll give you trouble-free runs. Also noteworthy, they sit on top of your ears, so you can still hear what is going on around you. I never really liked running with my ears in isolation from the rest of the world. Call it a safety factor, but I prefer to hear what is going on around me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for running", "unixReviewTime": 1382659200, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2013"}
