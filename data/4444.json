Compared to much more neutral HD580, bass is a little on the heavy side, and treble has a little more sparkle. But, these headphones are very enjoyable and quite detailed. The emphasis on the bass is largely due to the part of the headband where the drivers snap into. That round and concave surface right behind the divers amplifies the bass notes quite a bit. I took the drivers off the headband and put them into KSC75's ear clip (effectively making them KSC35) to see how the sound changes, and it confirmed my theory. Once off the headband, the sound signature became very similar to KSC75's with a little more bass and a little less sparkle in the high frequency range. Then I put KSC75 divers in sporta pro's headband, and well KSC75 became a bass monster. So by switching the dirvers back and forth, I can have for different headphones, sporta pro, KSC75, \"sporta75\" and KSC35, all for less than the price of KSC35 from Koss website.
