Harnack", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I wanted good headphones for my mp3 player and these fit the bill just fine for me.  They are the best I've found in the price range, and pretty comfortable too.  Some other reviewers found them unattractive, but I don't think they are that bad.  I'd rather have good sound and comfort than cute any day!  I like that they fold for storage, and come with their own little bag.  I am considering getting a hard shell case for them though, as the bag doesn't offer much protection.Nov. 2012 - I've had these little headphones for over 3 years now, and they are as good, or better, than when I bought them.  They are very well made, and I have since purchased 2 pair of PortaPro phones and a pair of Koss earbuds as well based on my love of these.  I haven't been disappointed yet. I have suggested these to several friends looking for good budget headphones, and have heard good things from them as well.  For the money you can't beat them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound from budget phones.", "unixReviewTime": 1242172800, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2009"}
