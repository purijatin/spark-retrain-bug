I was looking to replace the pricy Koss PortaPros, had tried the Koss KSC75 Portables but found them awkward and too fragile, as well as Koss&#8217;s &#8220;The Plug,&#8221; which yes&#8212;keep falling out of the ear. The SportPros are actually a mini-version PortaPros, same over-the head construction, fold-in ear pieces, leather case, and  plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound. Not to take anything away from the PortaPros, but  I can have two sets of these for the same price. They stay on your head, they stay on your ear, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the over-the-ear hooks of the  KSC75 Portables. Just an-all-around better headphone&#8212;nuf&#8217; said.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extremely happy.", "unixReviewTime": 1401753600, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2014"}
