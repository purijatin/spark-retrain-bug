A lot of people said this has the same drive as KSC75, so because I like to exercise and play sports and I really really like the sound of KSC75, I figured I want something that doesn't slip or fall out when I exercise and has similar sound to KSC75 (GREAT sound quality and HEAVY bass).Well when I got SportaPro the first time, I was kinda disappointed because it didn't have enough bass (I thought my KSC75 had more bass and even better sound). But after 2 months, I learned to like this headphones, and probably after it got &#34;burned&#34; for enough hours, the real sound came out and I admit that it also has deep bass. The sound quality is already good since the begining.The only thing is I don't know if this is waterproof/sweatproof or not, because I sweat a lot when I exercise, so I'm kinda afraid if it will ruin the headphone (it kinda defeats the purpose eh?).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "SportaPro and KSC75", "unixReviewTime": 1381708800, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2013"}
