Great response, great bass, clear midrange.  Gives the original Sennheiser PX-100 (another excellent headphone) a run for its money at less than half the price.By the way - The drivers are identical to the famous Koss PortaPro Headphones.  Despite what some claim, the sound between the Sportapro and the Portapro is identical.  I've owned at least 3 pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two.  Just buy whichever is cheaper.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1336089600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2012"}
