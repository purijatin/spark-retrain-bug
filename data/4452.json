Perhaps it works for them, but I hate it.  This set of headphones is already in the garbage.  Why?  The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be.  I have other headphones with much better sound, but that is not the primary reason that I dumped them.  The wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the ear-coverings, so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod.  I would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way.  Also, I like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt.  The wires on these headphones are too short for this, and with the wire-placement, the wires cut across my neck when I tried wearing them this way.  I have purchased two Koss products.  I've been disappointed with both.  There will not be a third.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Terrible", "unixReviewTime": 1298419200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011"}
