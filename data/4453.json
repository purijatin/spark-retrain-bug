While they almost have the detailed imaging of the Porta-Pros, they are 200% percent better in sound quality than my go-to running headphones, the Philips SHS5200/28.  I would give the Sporta-pro five stars, except that they aren't quite as comfortable as the Philips for extended wear. After an hour-long run, I felt that the Sporta-pros were pushing a little on the tops of my ears. The headband doesn't really feel secure the \"down\" position, so I've worn it up. Anyway, if Koss could take the ear pieces from the Sporta-pro and put them on a Philips type headband, they'd have an awesome sports headphone!!! hint, hint...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent sound", "unixReviewTime": 1320969600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2011"}
