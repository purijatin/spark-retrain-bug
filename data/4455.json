Hutchinson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have used an MP3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now. I cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when I move. I don't want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find. The Koss SportaPro is the best choice I have made yet at under 30 dollars. They sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place. The band pivots for the behind-the-head  or over-the-head style. I find the behind-the-head to be a little awkward, probably because I am not used to it, but they do stay in place, which is great for push-ups. I have read that some find them to be ugly but I could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Greatest workout headphones I have bought", "unixReviewTime": 1226102400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2008"}
