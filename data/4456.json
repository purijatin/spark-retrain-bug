They also grip the head well so they work for exercise.  On the negative side:  They are seriously fugly...like people will look at you funny ugly.  Also the 'strap' that goes around the back is NOT a strap.  It's steel.  The length is adjustable (though it can pull hair when you adjust), but it is rigid and doesn't really work in the \"around the back\" position (in the picture).  So I ended up wearing it in the \"over the top of the head\" position which worked fine but it's not what I wanted.  If you don't care how they look at all and you want seriously good sound, these are a good buy.  Otherwise I'd recommend you keep looking...I am...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "stiff and ugly, but great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1286496000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2010"}
