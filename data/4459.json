I had a pair from long ago and they are not adjustable the way this pair is.  I ordered now pads for my earpieces on the old set and ordered this one because it sounded like maybe it would fit better when I wore a hat.  While they work as advertised and God knows the price is fantastic as well as the warranty, they just aren't as comfortable as I thought they would be.  When wearing them as behind the neck, the pads/speakers seem to slip around a bit.  I still like them, just wish my head was shaped a bit different to make them a bit more comfortable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not quite a fit for me", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}
