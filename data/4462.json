Bass is full and the rest of the frequency spectrum is nothing to sneeze at.  Since statistically speaking you are like most people, you'll be plugging these into either an MP3 player full of badly-ripped, low-bitrate compressed audio tracks or else a crummy portable CD player with an extremely noisy potentiometer for a volume control.  Buying better than these perfectly respectable headphones would be a waste of money.The Sportapros fold up too, which makes them great for a coat pocket.  Also, the headband can fold in such a way that the headphones look like &quot;street-style&quot; headphones that are oh-so-popular these days.  This makes them clamp on your head a bit more, but it can't possibly be any less comfortable than any other headphones in such a configuration.  I think it looks stupid that way, but hey, if that's your cup of tea so be it.As for noise isolation, these don't offer much.  If you really don't want to hear the subway along with your gangsta rap, you should be looking at a pair of noise-cancelling phones or better yet in-ear headphones such as those made by Etymotics.  (The latter are a few times the price of the Sportapros on the bottom end, mind you.)It even comes with a fake leather bag that I keep laundry money in.  (Keeping a set of headphones this inexpensive in such a bag is just screaming &quot;I have OCD!&quot;) Bottom line, this is the best pair of portable headphones you can buy for the price.  They don't sound worse than the low-end Sennheisers in this price range, for example, and they are quite a bit smaller.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good stuff", "unixReviewTime": 1081123200, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2004"}
