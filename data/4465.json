They have strong bass, are loud, and the sound quality is great. They are pretty sturdy, I have owned 3 pairs, and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time. The only thing I suggest is buying some extra pads, they tend to get sweaty and I like to change them out so they can dry properly. I have ripped one, but replacements are cheap. Don't waste money on more expensive headphones, buy these and enjoy them for years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best budget headphones I have ever heard!", "unixReviewTime": 1256601600, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2009"}
