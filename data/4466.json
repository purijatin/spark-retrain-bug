Cordes", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Big Head People Beware", "unixReviewTime": 1327881600, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2012"}
