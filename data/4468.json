Fletcher \"Fletch\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I bought these on sale and took a chance after reading some reviews on them.  They really sound great for their size.  My main headphones are a set of Grado SR-60 which sound amazing but these sound very close.The headband is adjustable. The fit is good if you use the band over your head.  The behind the head use seems to not fit too comfortably for me and when I put it on that way the bad ripped a hair out of my head.I use these with my 40GB Fourth Generation iPod. They have a lifetime warranty and I use my headphones for working out and go through a new pair every 6 months. Save your receipt!They can sound a little bassy but I like that in a work out headphone especially since iPods really lack good bass. Excellent for almost any kind of music except classical.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Awesome Sound & Pretty Good Fit", "unixReviewTime": 1139011200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2006"}
