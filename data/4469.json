With these, there is no trade off. They sound great with excellent response and rich bass that isn't overbearing. They weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized head.As for looks and styling.. they sound great!  Then again, if your headphone purchase is based on &#34;fashion&#34;, the help you desperately need won't be found in product reviews.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound and great comfort", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}
