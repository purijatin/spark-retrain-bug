Excellent sound quality for the price -- far, far better than other portable headphones I've tried.  Excellent midrange and treble clarity, with pretty accurate bass.  A lot of cheap headphones in this price range have horrible, boomy bass.  Not these.  Sound quality degrades a bit at extremely high volume; if you want to listen to music THAT loudly, get earbuds instead.Can be worn with the band either over-the-top or flipped back in a wraparound configuration.  (This looks a little goofy, but does hold the headphones in place just fine.)  If you don't like the looks, the \"PortaPro\" model has the exact same drivers.The only real problem I've had is that after a while, the little foam pieces that help hold the headphones in place can tear off, and they're not easily replaceable.  KOSS has a lifetime warranty and will replace them under RMA, but it's a bit of a pain shipping them back.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sounds good, cheap, portable.", "unixReviewTime": 1292716800, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2010"}
