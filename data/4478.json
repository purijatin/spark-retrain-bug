Most \"mini\" headphones are lacking in either lows, mids or highs.  These have all frequency ranges covered.At first I could not figure out how they were supposed to work in behind-the-neck mode.  I tried it every which way, but they were always either awkward or loose.  I couldn't believe they promoted these as behind-the-neck headphones when they were so ill-fitting.But I did some googling, and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual:  The headband pivots.  So what you do is, put the headphones on the top of your head so that it's comfortable; hold the ear pieces in place on your ears; then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingers.This way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head, except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top.  It's very comfortable and they fit securely.  (They're actually not behind-the-neck phones, they're behind-the-head phones.)This may be common knowledge, but I didn't see it in any of the reviews I read, though I did see complaints about how they don't work behind the neck.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "How to wear them on the back of your head", "unixReviewTime": 1321920000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2011"}
