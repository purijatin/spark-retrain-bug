Smith", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The Sportapros along with the KSC35's and the Portapros all use the same wonderful drivers.  You can expect very nice frequency response in an affordable comfortable form factor that does not stick into your ear like buds (no ear canal fitting issues and you are still able to hear what's going on around you depending on volume for safety).  I have all three of the models listed above and love them all.  The Sportapros are by far the value item of the three because they sell for 50% less for the same sound quality.  I've had the KSC35's and Portapros for years with no issues what so ever.Register your phones for the lifetime warranty!  The other day my little kid busted the ear clicp on the KSC35's.  I call Koss and explained I need to \"buy\" the ear clip part because my kid was rough housing the phones.  They said \"no we don't sell the parts... will will just ship them to you for free\".  The whole call took 3 minutes of my time.  The clip arrived three days later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Koss is a great company and these are very high value phones that sound great!", "unixReviewTime": 1373155200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2013"}
