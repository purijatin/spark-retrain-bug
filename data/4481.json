High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1236816000, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2009"}
