Many over the ear phones don't allow for much adjustment for head size, but these can accommodate a wider range than most.  In addition, each ear cup can swivel independently.  I've used them for many years now, primarily while running.  They fold up somewhat for storage.  I've owned several of them, and only once did one go bad--a wire going into the cups came loose.  Hours of sweat on the foam cups hasn't hurt them.  I can't speak about sound quality, because of all the noise I generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination.  They fit, they last, they are comfortable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best over the ear sport phones", "unixReviewTime": 1325116800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2011"}
