To me, the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros, but I admit I do not hear very well. That doesn't mean i can't tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair, but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality. These however look much nicer I think, and appear as though they will last a lot longer too. Of course they come with lifetime warranty, so when they break down (which my porta pros often did) just mail them to the company on the box with $6 and they'll send you a replacement pair pretty quickly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than porta pros in build quality, about the same in audio quality.", "unixReviewTime": 1385078400, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2013"}
