The sound is incredible for something in this price range, but I feel embarrassed using it in public, even though savvy audiophiles know it's cool. So I got the SportaPro. It's sounds as good. But it's not quite as embarrassing to wear.UPDATE:After nearly a month of use, I can say that not only am I pleased with the SportaPro, I favor it over the PortaPro. While the sound quality between the two is about equal, I find the SportaPro to be more comfortable, especially for wearing for a long duration. I've addressed the aesthetics, but I'll reiterate that I feel a bit embarrassed when I wear the PortaPro, in contrast to the SportaPro.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sounds same as PortaPro, but less dorky looking", "unixReviewTime": 1388620800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2014"}
