Many of the reviews said the SportaPro offered great sound, deep bass, and wide range. Well, I have not been disappointed.Although I'm not an audio expert, I am impressed with the range of these headphones; the sound is as good or better than headphones costing $60 or more. They're pretty small, comfortable, and they're collapsible, so they're easy to carry when on the road.Some reviewers have remarked that they're ugly. I don't wear headphones to make a fashion statement, and frankly, although these aren't great looking, I don't think they're that bad either. Also, there's no longer a mute switch on these headphones. Apparently, they were causing problems (a short) so Koss removed this feature. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Product for a Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1011398400, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2002"}
