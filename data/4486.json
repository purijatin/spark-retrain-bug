Davidson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "*** UPDATE 1/21/11 ***  I've found that the design is not a problem at all with my workout.  I've change my rating to 5-star as the sound is absolutely terrific.  Compare very favorably if not better than my PortaPros and Sennheiser HD238's.I should have read the reviews more carefully and I would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like I wanted.  The picture does not indicate this at all, nor is it specified in the description.  Dual may technically be better for sound than single, but for my purposes it is awkward.  I primarily use a rowing machine which means I place my player down on the floor next to me while using, then the rower has quite a bit of forward/back motion.  The dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome, and the cord also winds up being too short, I will at least need an extender.I haven't played much with the fit, but it does seem that over-the-head is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck.  That's ok with me but I would have preferred the other.They seem to sound good, and for the price I haven't risked much, but had I known the design I would have kept looking.  I'll try these for awhile but I may not be able to use them for my purposes at all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Originally disappointed by dual-cord design - but is not a problem.", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"}
