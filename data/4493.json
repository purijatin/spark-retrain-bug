I am a big fan of neckband headphones, (don't use ear buds) as I have used Sony's discontinued G57's and Philips discontinued headphones as well.  First, these are sold to be versatile to be worn as neckbands if you want but they are uncomfortable, and are NOT neckband replacements if that is what you truly want.  I wear them over my head, and when I put them on, the metal pinches my head when it adjusts for size.The reason I kept them was for the sound.  They are awesome.  They are more bass-y but great for outdoors.  even though they are bigger than most neckbands, they are still light weight.  If Koss would get these on a traditional neckband frame, I would give it five stars easy.  My old Sony's almost had as good sound, but the neckband and comfort (light weight and snug fit over ears) still make them my favorite compared to the Koss.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1376265600, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2013"}
