Northrip \"SamN\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "We researched many head phones and decided on either Bose or Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones. While shopping on ebay we found a pair of Bose at a reasonable price. We purchased them, but even though we paid immediately, the seller chose not to ship the product. We did recover our money, but in the meantime thought we would give the SportaPro a try. I never did get to compare the Bose with the PortaPro, but these head phones give an awesome sound. Not being an audiophile I simply enjoy a great sound. They work well with a Lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card, and the sound is much better than my Sony Rack system.When I use these headphones, the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced. Recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value. You don't really need to spend $200 when you can get a high quality unit like the Koss. Am buying some more of these for some Grand Kids.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value", "unixReviewTime": 1279584000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2010"}
