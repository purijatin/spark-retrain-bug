Kanter", "helpful": [16, 18], "reviewtext": "I bought these phones based on the large number of very positive reviews here; I just received them, and am not disappointed.I got them to use with my Rio 500 MP3 player, which came with unuseable Koss earbuds (the foam coverings fell off every time you put it in your ear. They were also innefficient -- not loud enough).The Sportaphones sound excellent -- very smooth highs, efficient enough for good volume, and deep bass. My only complaint is a little overemphasis in the mid-bass, but this can be fixed with the Rio 500's EQ settings.The Sportaphones are pretty comfortable, although I can't see ever using them in the back-of-the-head position. The spring-type band forces them against your ears which will always help bass reproduction in phones. On the down side, this could cause fatigue after long periods.They fold up, quite ingeniously, to a very small package, and the leatherette bag plus gold connectors are nice extras. I don't know what the fuss is about their looks -- I don't think they are particularly ugly, and least on my head. I guess if you are ugly to begin with, the phones won't improve your looks! ;-)In conclusion, they are a great bargain for the price. I hope they hold up; maybe I'll get a spare pair just in case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Little Suckers!", "unixReviewTime": 972432000, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2000"}
