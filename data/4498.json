(Nothing wrong with the quality, just I like to have one pair at home, one pair at office and another pair stuffed in my backpack)It looks fragile and sometimes ugly. But what really counts is the sound. The characteristics of the sound are: clean, warm, dynamic (overs a wide range from low to high), very good sensitivity (very loud at normal volume setting), lots of bass (although a little boomy at times). The first time when you hear it you will be surprise for its powerful bass. I hate the mute button but I heard recently Koss had taken it off. For protable use it's probably the best in its price class. Some people complain about the comfortability issue, I have no problem wearing it for hours though.For more serious listening, I would highly recommend a pair of Grado SR60 (open style). It's about $70 and I couldn't believe how much pleasure I had taken from listening to it. The highs are crystal clear, the bass is good but not boomy at all (you can feel it), the warm, open mid range is simply seductive. The transparency and spacious of the sound stage is amazing. It stirs up your feelings and emotions when listening to most vocal, classic and pop music. It's pity that Amazon.com doesn't carry this headphone, truely a gem in the protable headphone family.Another pair (closed style, around $70-80) I could recommend is Sony's MDR-V6. Good frequency range, very good bass, very clean sound and very little coloration of sound. However unlike the grado, the sound is flat although maybe more accurate. I will describe the sound as \"scientific\" comparing with grado's \"emotional\" and \"liveness\".", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Probably the best in its price class", "unixReviewTime": 1043971200, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2003"}
