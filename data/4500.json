Solomon", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought these from an affiliate seller as I live close to them here in NYC and I was able to save a few $$.  These are great headphones but if you are expecting to block out all other noise, forget it.  The way these are designed you are still able to hear what is going on around you which here in NYC is a good thing.  You still hear the music which comes through loud and clear.  I was hearing subtle notes and tones with these even through the surrounding street noise which I never did with my cheapo Colby headset which did a good job of blocking out noise when playing music.There is good tension on the metal headband but the way this is designed with foam rests make for a very comfortable fit.  I have worn these for a number of hours straight with glasses without any discomfort.This has a straight plug which I like as it does not interfere with the case for my iphone 3G.  When a call comes in I just unplug the headphone and move the speaker off of my ear.  I do not have to worry about breaking these as they are of a solid construction.  Even if they did break, Koss provides a LIFETIME warranty though the cost of shipping is about 25% of what I paid.  If these ever do break I may just buy a different pair but who knows.To sum up, these are probably the best bang for your buck for over the head phones.  They are not pretty though so if you are more concerned with looks than with good sound go buy something else.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Sound Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1218758400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2008"}
