The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm. Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580's but those cans cost ~$200. Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time. Eventually, they start falling out a lot. Nice sounding phones but won't take huge amounts of abuse.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Sound-- A little flimsy", "unixReviewTime": 1135555200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2005"}
