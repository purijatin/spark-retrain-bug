I can't say I ever really needed to use the band behind the head trick, but for the sonic quality they deliver, the warranty they offer, the flexibility to switch the headband position, and the price you pay for the deal, these deserve 6 stars!I own these since around 2000-2001 and I just recently started hearing some rattling in the right ear channel. No problem - sent them out to be repaired by KOSS, for a marginal cost of shipping they were returned to me with new membranes, a new cord, and new cushions, plus a thank you note!These beat a lot of other headphones I've owned.Plenty of kickin bass and pure crystal clear highs. good mids too.A word of caution: the headband is not for giant heads, but should fit just fine for most.Recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Awesome, have them for 12 years!!", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2012"}
