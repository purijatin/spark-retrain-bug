The sound responsiveness is very good.  The main reason I did not rate them a 5 is they are not quite as comfortable as I would like.  I use them while I exercise, and I find that I have to adjust them for comfort long before I am done.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Headphones perform well", "unixReviewTime": 1140134400, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2006"}
