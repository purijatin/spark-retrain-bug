Still not the perfect phone, especially when I am used to the full-size Sony closed-ear MDR-V6/MDR-7506, which emphasize the treble slightly while having the full sound you get from a good headphone. My Sony's are also more efficient--they're louder. PS, I wish I could find the cans that came with aiwa portable tape players a few years ago. They were great, and you could hear the cymbals dancing clearly.The LOOK: somewhat ugly plastic form.The HEADBAND: can be bent down to go behind your head to keep your gel in style. Still stays on. I liked the Sonys for this and their great look, but their sound was atrocious and they were less comfortable.The PRESSURE: the extra pads just above your ears take most of the pressure holding them on your head, so they stay on and don't press your ears too much.The BUTTON: yes, it has a mute button on the cord, but it's too low, at the waistband if you're 5'-6\" and sitting in your chair, and when you cross your arms the music cuts out.The PLUG: has a quick-connect regular and mini combo plug.The BAG: You get a leatherette bag to put them in.The SIZE: They close up flat into a 6\" x 4\" area for storage.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the money, but get full-size for full sound", "unixReviewTime": 1033171200, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2002"}
