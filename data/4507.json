I thoight to myself, what should I expect for less then $25 a pair. Oh my God, with the correct persoonal ajustments to your MP3 player, the sound is NO LESS THEN AWESOME. THE SOUND IS CLEAR  AS A BEEL RIGHT ACCROSS THE SPECTRUM. If you are not careful, the bass wil completely blow you away. I have ear phones that cost upwards of $300 + and they do not come close. They are comfortable and stay on your head at the gym not matter what part of the circut you are on. Buy them and then buy some more!!! I am not kidding After I finish wring this review, I am going to order two more pair. Oh yes, buy the extra foam ear-pieces.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The price for the sound is much to low!", "unixReviewTime": 1282780800, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2010"}
