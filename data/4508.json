The unit is okay but has some klitches.  Currently I am running my MD player/recorder and my dual cassett deck through this unit to my receiver.  It allows me to do this because it will acommodate two tape decks as well, I might add, tv or audio visual.  These are important features if you are using last years model receiver with no MD input. You can really impact ont eh bass midrange and the high notes with this unit it has the goods what is difficault is that the buttons stick and as a consequence you have to manipulate them to make sure they are all the way in or all the way out.  Before I figured this out I thouhgt the unit was broke and put it in the garbage.  I couldn't just pitch and it is a good thing because when I got an MD recorder and realized I needed a way to attach it to my stereo I started playing around with the unit and discovered the stiky button problem.  Now I am just recording away and am pleased.  Like anything in this life there are ups and down points.  If you have some patience and want great bass or more difined midrange or aweet highs even playing with annoying buttons makes this unit worth the price", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a neceesity but with limitations", "unixReviewTime": 983577600, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2001"}
