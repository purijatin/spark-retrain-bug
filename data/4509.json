It is really alot of fun to watch your music and/or movies come to life. It is definitely a conversation starter.That said, the audio input and output to analog only. Therefore if you have digital audio, you need to get a converter.Overall, a fun purchase if you are looking for a light show.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun Optional Component", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2014"}
