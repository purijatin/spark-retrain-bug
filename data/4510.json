I was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that I've read on Amazon but I also didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on my Pioneer stereo (circa 1985).It was easy to setup and connected my CD and turntable within minutes.  I was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully I had an turn table amp that I purchased from Amazon (see that review) a few years back, connected it and records play wonderfully.I do not have issues that others have reported, like I said, it sounds great and it was easy to setup.  I would say this is a great buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good unit, great price", "unixReviewTime": 1349136000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2012"}
