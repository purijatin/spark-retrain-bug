I wanted one, especially after my old Technics graphic equalizer had given up the ghost!The sound was ok, but it just wasn't sounding like it did before the old equalizer died!With this new unit, it helps give the sound coming from your headphones and speakers that extra kick which also give a tremendous boost to the bass & highs!! The dazzling Spectrum Analyzer Display give the appearance of dancing Christmas lights!  You can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of music!My old Technics unit was good, but it didn't have the display. Just the buttons that light up in red. There are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power, Tape 2 & 2, Audio/Video, EQ Bypass, EQ Record and Line/Tape. Two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left & right channels.When the unit is turned on, the power button lights up in green. In the off position, it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back on.Getting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course! At first there was no audio for about 3 or 4 tries. Then I thought about sending it back until I hooked up the audio cables, and then, the audio worked perfectly!!All in all, I think that it's a great addition to anyone's stereo system!! I just hope that no problems develop with it.~Daquan13.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Addition to You Stereo System!!
