Anderson \"04jeepwrangler\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "This equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up.  This will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry.  Not a complaint at all though.The range on this thing is very good, also allows you to EQ recordings you make to CD, Tape or MP3 if desired.  Made the music sound much bigger and sharper.  Especially feeling my CD's were flat in sonic output.  If not desired, the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch.Mine was built a year or so ago, sat around in it's box and yes, got \"sticky\" before it was sold.  I quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out.  Not a problem since.Smooth operation that doesn't impart a \"click\" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live.  Plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell.  Quite pleased, gonna buy another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Way to Expand Range", "unixReviewTime": 1171584000, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2007"}
