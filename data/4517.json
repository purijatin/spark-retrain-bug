ART is actually DJ/real quality with unbalanced RCA jacks for home use as well as the balanced jacks for pro use.Ultra-quiet, high quality potentiometers, discrete 2-channels with output control, clipping indicators, 6 or 12 db scale select for each channel.  Ground lift select for possible source grounding problems.Just need to buy 4 rubber adhesive feet for home shelf mounting, rather than rack mounting.  Comes without feet and rack ears for 19\" rack.  Much nicer EQ than this Audio Source junk, and I've owned both.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "JUNK - Buy an ART 341 for less, much better!", "unixReviewTime": 1363564800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2013"}
