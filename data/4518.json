It is so user friendly that we purchased it for my 70+ year old parents for Christmas, and they are already using it to sell things at online auction  sites.  Resolution is EXCELLENT, ease of use is exceptional, and you cannot  beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling  up the images -- WHY would anyone waste their time (and more importantly  their money) on those digital cameras with dumb &quot;smart cards&quot;  that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software.  The Sony comes with respectable software, but I HIGHLY recommend purchasing  PICTURE IT software -- it is ideal for use with this camera.  If I had one  criticism it would be about storage space - the floppies don't hold as many  pictures as I'd like, but it's really not a big issue unless you're going  out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing  through them later (in which case you just need to take some spare floppies  with you).  Truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediately.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony MVC-FD88 Mavica Digital Camera", "unixReviewTime": 950486400, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2000"}
