This is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod).  You can then install the B&N Nook reader app and Amazon's own Kindle App (along with 1000's of other apps like Angry Birds).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Forget the reader, Root it for Android!", "unixReviewTime": 1301616000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2011"}
