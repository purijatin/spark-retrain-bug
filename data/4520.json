The first picture I took turned out great!  The camera is very user friendly which is good because the manual that Sony provides is not very well organized or well written.I find  the floppy disk storage to be easy and convenient. The camera allows you to  make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of  photos with friends on the spot.The Mpeg movies are a fun little add  on.  I am taking the camera to England in April and I think it will be fun  to capture little movie clips over there.The rechargeable battery seems  to be adequate. I am planning to purchase the more powerful one that  provides longer charge.The video and audio cables provided allow easy  viewing of the photos on the TV set.The only  negatives with the camera  are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on (but no  other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful)  Also, the light  that leaks out of the window at the top of the LCD screen.  This can be  annoying in a dark room.Overall, this camera delivered the features  that I was looking for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Camera That is Packed with Features", "unixReviewTime": 950745600, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2000"}
