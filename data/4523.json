I liked the light body - it was easy to carry around and didn't weigh down my bag much at all.  Naturally the camera got banged around quite a bit, and I even dropped it in its bag a few times.  However, even though it was abused enough for the filter to crack, and I had to re-align the view mirrors when I returned, the camera kept working with absolutely no problems, through all of the 600 photographs I took.The pictures quality was excellent.  I didn't have problems with graininess, and I'd guess that the reviewers used 800 film.  Automatic focus was plenty fast.  Actually, I ended up being lazy and using the automatic features most of the time, but with few exceptions, the results were about what I'd expect.  If I had to do it again, I'd get a lens with more zoom, but that's more personal preference than anything - the included lens worked fine.I strongly recommend using a non-obtrusive filter, to protect the lens from scratches and damage.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Travelling", "unixReviewTime": 982627200, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2001"}
