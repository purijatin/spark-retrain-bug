I used it immediately, switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything. It was exactly like a point and shoot. But when I learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed, I took even better photos. I highly recommend this camera. I took it to Alaska in August and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were. If you have the money, also invest in a telefoto lens. Sometimes 80mm just isn't long enough. But you can always add that later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love my camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1036972800, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2002"}
