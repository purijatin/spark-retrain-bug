It takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with. The price was very low considering the great quality photos I can take with it. I couldn't be happier and I take it everywhere. The only disadvantage I can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find, and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera. It works with 2  CR2 2 V Batteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely love it.", "unixReviewTime": 1373587200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2013"}
