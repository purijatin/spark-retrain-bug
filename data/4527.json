The autofocus 28-80 lens works for all but the longest shots, and telephoto lenses are readily available. It's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price. It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range. This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also), but with more features and even easier to use. A lot of &quot;Bang For The Buck&quot;!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great All Around SLR", "unixReviewTime": 1059350400, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2003"}
