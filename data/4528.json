However, at the cost, I can't give it an exceptional rating.I use this camera to take action sports photos.  If you're close to the action, the camera does a good job.  But, $400 seems so expensive to me, even if that is what the market will bear.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice camera, but expensive", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"}
