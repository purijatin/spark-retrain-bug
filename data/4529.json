One thing the STSI offers that the Canon doesn't is predictive autofocus. This can be quite useful when doing action shots. It also offers a panorama mode, which the Canon doesn't offer. I've enjoyed using this mode quite a bit on my little Fuji Tiara APS camera. Both cameras have similar F ratios for the lens and both have 1/2000th of a sec top shutter speeds. Two things the Canon offers that are nice are the 7 selectable autofocus points, which some advanced users might find useful, and depth-of-field preview. Even the Elan II doesn't offer the latter capability. One last thing to be aware of is that the Minolta camera will usually be offered with a 3rd party lens. If you want a Minolta lens you'll need to pay quite a bit more for it. However, the Canon comes with a Canon lens but doesn't cost any more. All in all, this is a pretty feature-packed camera at an attractive price, which should serve the needs of the vast majority of photo buffs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera", "unixReviewTime": 1008201600, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2001"}
