It it lightweight, takes fabulous pictures, and looks good to boot!  Having used my mom's Rebel X for years, I finally bought the 2000 in September of 2002.  I love the fact of having it!  In the bag, it doesn't break my shoulders like the X did, and takes beautiful photos.  I am into SLR, however, my first digital will be a Minolta DiMage 7i (non-SLR).  I *will* be keeping this one, though, for the long distance shots with the other lense I have for it and teleconverter.  Worth having for anybody!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lightweight!", "unixReviewTime": 1046563200, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2003"}
