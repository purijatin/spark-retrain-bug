She is very happy with the features and the light weight, as well as its ease of operation...you can run it as a point-and-shoot camera, fully manual, or any of a number of modes in between. The only negative to this camera is the standard 28-80 lens, but if you are a casual photographer you won't mind its mediocure optical performance. Remember, this is a relatively inexpensive camera and it has a lot of features for the money. If you want to spend more on the lens, get the excellent Canon 28-105 lens, or for more flexability get one of the third party 28-300 lenses (which aren't great optically but again are a great value).I own a Canon Elan IIe, which is a better camera in some ways but I would certainly recommend the Rebel 2000 to anyone wanting a superior point and shoot, a photography student, or a traveller needing light weight and do-it all capability, or even as a second body for someone with another Canon camera (I'm thinking about this myself).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great camera, great value", "unixReviewTime": 1009411200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2001"}
