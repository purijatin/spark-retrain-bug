I love the light weight and the auto focus/flash that pops up when required.My only disappointment was that when I got the unit I didn't realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you time/date stamp your photos. If I had known about  that other model I would have ordered it.Bought this camera after  having used my sisters. Can be as simple or complex to use as needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy To Use With Tons of Features", "unixReviewTime": 946598400, "reviewTime": "12 31, 1999"}
