Edelman", "helpful": [47, 47], "reviewtext": "I've been using Nikons for over 20 years, starting with my first used and battered Ftn. Over that time I've a accumulated a dozen Nikkor lenses and numerous accessories, as well as an assortment of bodies.One thing  that's been missing in recent years from the Nikon line is a reasonably  priced entry-level manual camera. The cheaper Nikons have tended to be  fully automated cameras, and the cheapest manual Nikon still being made  was, until recently, the FM2 at well over $500.If you work the way I do,  you need a manual camera  and don't have a lot of use for automation and  autofocusing. If you own an old Nikon and some old Nikkor lenses, you may  want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them. If you're a  student starting out, or an artist on a budget, you need a manual  camera.If you fit into any of these categories, the FM10 is a great  choice. It may not be as rugged as a $1200 F3 or a $2500 F5, but it's well  made and should last many years. I'm not a fan of zoom lenses for my own  work, but the included 35-70 is a good quality lens with a useful range,  and you can add more lenses if you need them.All in all, a good value  and a long-needed inexpensive entry into the Nikon system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A return to basics- with Nikon quality", "unixReviewTime": 957139200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2000"}
