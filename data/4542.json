I did a lot of reading before using it and found out that SanDisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs. They are the ONLY brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs (I had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash).I have bought almost 3,000 designs over the years and I always trust using a SanDisk Compact Flash card over anything else on the market!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SanDisk Does It Again!", "unixReviewTime": 1365638400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2013"}
