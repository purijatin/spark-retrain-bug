I picked this up (about 4 1/2 years ago), when it was state of the art & about sixty bucks or so. I still have both cards! Well over 4,000 photos & bazillions of files!! Never a read or write error! I've never lost anything with it. Unlike the Lexar!If you're looking into compact flash cards, go with who started it. I have a 128mb sandisk, & am now looking into their 2 gig Ultra card, for my new camera. Because I want speed, & need the space for 8MP photos.The write/capture function is slow, it's not meant for speed. But for swapping & transferring it's faster than from cd (with the right reader/writer)!SD cards & micro drive are inching in, but Sandisk keeps imporoving the CF (they also make SD cards).There are cheaper & less expensive cards out there, but how important is your data/photo? You can't always retrieve your files, with the flash memory programs. I know. I used three of them on my Lexar, & NEVER got all of the images. But that just may be the cards I have, who knows? There isn't any quality control any longer, who cares? Sandisk is the most accurate.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sandisks & keeping the data", "unixReviewTime": 1115424000, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2005"}
