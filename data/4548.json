The card works properly and was at a good price.  What else can you ask for?Not much, unless you find that you sometimes take lots of photos.  I guess that includes me.  In which case you'll wish that you purchased a larger card.  I bought the Viking 128mb card, and now feel completely prepared with the combined cards providing enourmous storage.  Unless you are going to be away for an extended period, I can't imagine needing more space.The bottom line is that this card works, but you need to really consider what your storage requirements will be so you can select the right size.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works, inexpensive, what else can you ask", "unixReviewTime": 972259200, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2000"}
