This card will allow you to record about 50 pictures at the standard (640x480) resolution, so if you find you're not a  'power user' of your camera, it should be plenty - and the  dollars-to-megabyte ratio is right!However, if you regularly shoot at  higher resolutions such as 1600x1200 (i.e. 8&quot; x 10&quot; photo  quality), you won't be able to fit 20 photos on this card.  In that event,  you might want to think about going for their 96MB card (also available  from Amazon!)With this size card you might also want to think about  going for Sandisk's inexpensive USB card reader - it's up to 50x as fast  and a lot less hassle than hooking the camera up to the computer!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super storage at the right price!", "unixReviewTime": 961200000, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2000"}
