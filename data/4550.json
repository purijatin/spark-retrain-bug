The MemPlug module, by PiTech, allows a Handspring Visor to use a CompactFlash (or SmartMedia) card as if it were an extension of the hand held's own RAM. I made the mistake of initially purchasing a CompUSA CompactFlash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible. The SanDisk is a winner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works with everything", "unixReviewTime": 996796800, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2001"}
