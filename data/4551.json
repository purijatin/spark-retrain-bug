The price and  capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events.  **Go crazy**  and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eye!I  took 89 pictures in 5 hours at my company's &quot;Relay for Life&quot;  event on Friday, and really enjoyed not having to &quot;budget&quot; my  photos or worry about running out of film.  The image quality was  excellent, and downloading was quick &amp; easy with a digital film  reader.I'm planning a 2-week trip to Spain this fall, and am considering  an additional 32MB SanDisk memory card just in case I get **Too Crazy**.  Does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cards?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "**Go Crazy**", "unixReviewTime": 965520000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2000"}
