But after replacing it, I have had no physical problems since.This package includes a manual, the webcam, webcam software and some image  editing software. I never used the Image software so cannot say much about  it. The Webcam software is excellent, it includes the regular Video and  Image capture software but also has a motion detector program. This allows  you to capture images any time someone or anything passes the camera, great  for detecting if people are using the computer when your out.The quality  of the camera is great. 640 x 480 video capture is quite jerky, at about 12  fps average but at 320 x 480, the image is quite smooth sometimes exceeding  30 fps. The focus is a little dial on the lens, easy to adjust (Autofocus  would be nice though)This camera works well on Netmeetings and Cuseeme,  I have had no problems since. By the way, installing was quite easy, all  the programs installed from the installer, I had absolutely no  problems.All in all, this is a very decent package. I only once had to  talk to tech support and their service was prompt and helpful.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent and cheap quality webcam", "unixReviewTime": 959385600, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2000"}
