I do not know why the others had problems. Pluged it in, Win98 picked up the new device, pointed it to the drivers on the CD, cranked up net meeting, and I was off!If you want fast top notch quality video, then spend more on a better  web cam, but if you just want a basic (with some cool features like zoom) camera for a very low price, then this is the camera for you.  I do not regret  buying it, as it was a great, cheap, way for me to get my feet wet with video conferencing, among other things.Enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good buy - for the money", "unixReviewTime": 973468800, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2000"}
