Soares", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought this camera about 5 months ago and was really excited, considering this was my first web-cam.  It has worked reasonably well throughout this time.  The only complaint that I have with this cam is that  when I activate the camera software it deactivates my Internet connection.  Other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user  but also the novice.  The picture quality is not bad and for the price you  really can't ask for much more.  As for the software it was also easy to  install and to use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An OK Webcam", "unixReviewTime": 958867200, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2000"}
