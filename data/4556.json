The instructions weren't 100% in line with the choices in Windows 98. Once installed, camera works easily.  Picture is not great, but clear.  The  manual focus is not that meaningful. The web update and &quot;watch&quot;  functionality work well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works Just Fine", "unixReviewTime": 956707200, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2000"}
