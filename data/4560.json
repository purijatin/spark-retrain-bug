The picture is clear and if you set the contrast right, images look great.  The only thing I dislike about the QuickCam is that it's very difficult to set it on a table, on top of the monitor, anywhere without it toppling back or falling sideways.  The round camera comes with a rubber base to put it on.  The round camera has something like a metal hook or screw on the bottom, and the base has a slit on top.  You're supposed to slide the screw back and forth on the slit in order to point it where you want to record, but once you get the angle, the heavy cable pulls the camera back and it goes toppling to the floor.  Very frustrating at the least.  I found myself moving towards where tha camera was finally pointing.Otherwise, the software is pretty easy to use, even though it takes very long to load.  I have Windows ME.  You can record videos of unlimited length.  I've had so much fun with this thing!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One detail", "unixReviewTime": 1010448000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2002"}
