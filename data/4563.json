I replaced it because for some reason Windows XP doesn't like it and it can't be used with XP since the OS upgrade. This camera installed easy but I had to D/L the XP software off the web as the software it came with is old. I expected at least the same quality as the other since it's been years and I now have the best OS available. NO!!! The picture quality is crap and can't be tweaked. There is this total grainy appearance to the images and the DPI seems much less even though its still 150DPI. Don't waste your money.....I don't see any resolution/quality differences with the more expensive models either....good luck,Mike", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Picture sucks......severe quality drop from older model", "unixReviewTime": 1009584000, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2001"}
