The only reason I've replaced my previous two pair was because I lost them!  One in a seatback on a plane.  They're quite durable.  The winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures.  The sound is good, not great, but I'm fine with making the trade for durability and convenience.  I laid in a second set as a spare for when I eventually lose them again!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "quite durable, decent sound", "unixReviewTime": 1199923200, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2008"}
