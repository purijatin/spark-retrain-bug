This is one of the best.  The sound is THE BEST I have found no matter the price range.  I especially like the smaller ear buds.  Some of others were an \"areaness factor\".  They were so big I was constantly aware of their pressure.  I don't feel these.  They are so comfortable, I don't notice anything but beautiful sound.  Full range from highs to low with no fuzziness or distortion.  Just pure rich clean sound.The cord is coated and reinforced, so will take wear.Great item, great price.So put on Clannad or Silly Tinkers and have at it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The tops!!", "unixReviewTime": 1126483200, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2005"}
