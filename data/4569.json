I use them exclusively for working out and running.  They have pretty good sound, a nice carrying case, and have survived over a year's worth of running.  I have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out.  In fact, I use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when I run.  Despite this, no problems.This is probably the best pair of earbud-style headphones I have ever purchased.  I am so happy that I am ordering another pair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Sound, Good durability", "unixReviewTime": 1121040000, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2005"}
