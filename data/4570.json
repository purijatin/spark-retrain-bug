After a few months of moderate daily use (MP3 player in my shirt pocket) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail.  Regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and I don't expect these ear-buds to last to the end of the year.  Too bad since they produce nice sound.----------------------------------------------------Had these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on.  First tried to use the buds as they were packed - without the little spongy covers over the buds - and was totally disappointed with a loose fit, weak midrange, scratchy treble, and almost no bass whatsoever.Finally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try ... Wha?!?!  Were these the same phones?  The buds fit much better in my ears and I had a totally different experience with great mids, good treble, and very decent bass.These earbuds won't change your life but they'll make your MUNI commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commuters.Just remember to use the sponge thingys.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Use the Sponge Thingys", "unixReviewTime": 1084752000, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2004"}
