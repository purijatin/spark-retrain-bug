So I've always also just assumed that I'd never have clear sound. No more! These headphones are wonderful.The range of music I like is very much varied. These sound great for all types, and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs. I'm really amazed, actually. It's weird having sound that's as good as a nice stereo when you're walking the dog.One setback is that I need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable. It's a setback for me. Maybe my ears are getting bigger as I get older? This has never been an issue. Regardless, it's a tiny fault for the best, cheapest headphones I've ever bought.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They really are the best", "unixReviewTime": 1064966400, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2003"}
