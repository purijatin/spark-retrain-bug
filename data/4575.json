I bought a pair of Sony MDR-v900, and a pair of Sony MDR-7506 from their pro-line.The v900 sounds fine for non-critical listening, but the 7506 shows much more detail.  If you really wanna hear what's in the mix, the 7506 is the ticket.The v900 does favors for low bit-rate mp3 encoded stuff, and it's pleasant to listen to...with a bit of a bump in the 100-200Hz region, but there's just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projects.I bought more pairs of MDR-7506...that should tell you something.  There has been some talk that Sony may discontinue the 7506...sure hope that doesn't happen.BTW, the consumer MDR-v600 is NOT the same thing as the pro-line MDR-7506.  The v600 sounds much more like the MDR-v900.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1128038400, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2005"}
