These Sony Headphones do sound really good, but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great sound.These Sony Monitor Headphones are very good for home use which is what I purchased them for.  The music I listen to works well with these nicely; Meditation and Environmental Music files, also Drum Music.Sony has a great line of products, but the Construction of the cords are very poor.  If the cord had greater quality, then these headphones would have another star in my rating.As far as my recomendation is for these, Well, I can't make one since they only would last for five yrs.  I have used them a lot, but have starting using my Sony earbuds more, and even those seem to have poor cord construction.So because of the Very Poor Cord Construction, I would now suggest another brand for Headphones, or Earbuds.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "5 years after Purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1278892800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2010"}
