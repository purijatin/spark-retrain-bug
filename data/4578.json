Ricci Jr.", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I have had a variety of Sony Headphones (and others over the years - Sennheiser, Nady, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc.) including the MDR V-700, V-300, V-7506 and others.  These MDR-V900 Monitors though are the best!  I use them for monitoring music, movies, and most importantly, I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church.  They have a great \"boot'en\" bottom-end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction...they simply kick! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer, sound technician, and guitarist for our church group.  My opinion is you can't go wrong with these babies!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Sound Reproduction", "unixReviewTime": 1108080000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2005"}
