At first they were a little tight on my wide head, but after a while they broke in and were very comfortable.For recording, I found these phones to accentuate the bass a little too much.However, for ham (amateur) radio, they are excellent for discerning weak signals.A short wave enthusiast would probably also like these phones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones for ham radio", "unixReviewTime": 1227312000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2008"}
