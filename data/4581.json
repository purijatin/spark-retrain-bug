Everything sounds muted, the highs don't extend very far, the lows are almost non existent.  Their sound is anything but clear.  Dynamics?  Forget about itI'm looking for a $20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times.  I figured these might do the job...but wow was I wrong.I found the Sony MDR-XD100, which is actually cheaper, sound much better.  Did I mention the build quality sucks?  The XD100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired.  Perhaps that's just low end Sonys in general?I'm thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of Sennheiser PX100s or AKG K81DJs.My main headphones are the Grado SR-80 and BeyerDynamic DT990s...I know what good sounds like.  All my music is either FLAC or 192 Kbps VBR mp3s.I'm giving these headphones a two star because I've heard worse...and much better for cheaper.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Listening to music through a blanket", "unixReviewTime": 1197331200, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2007"}
