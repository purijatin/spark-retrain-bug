I have bought several different brands in various price ranges (all the way up to $100), and these are the best bang for the buck. I don't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced. The only problem with these Sony's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears. Would buy these again if they last a few years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are about the best sound quality you can get for under $25.", "unixReviewTime": 1381104000, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2013"}
