I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Have purchased 5 sets of these", "unixReviewTime": 1360627200, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2013"}
