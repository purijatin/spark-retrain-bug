I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones for a reasonable price!", "unixReviewTime": 1194048000, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2007"}
