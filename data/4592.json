I have a home recording studio and use these when I play. They are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end. This is one step up from the MDR-150. The only difference being the inline volume control. These also sound great with my phone or MP3 player.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1376784000, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2013"}
