I have had these headphones for years.  I wear them at work for hours at a time and can say from experience that they are comfortable. I really appreciate the volume control on the cord.  Unlike another reviewer, I have had no problems with it. I normally use these with either my computer or my iPod classic, listening to music, podcasts and audio books.  They sound pretty good for the money. They have also held up well.  Of course, they don't sound as good as my more expensive Sennheiser phones that I have at home.  They are just beginning to wear out, so I may be getting another pair just like them as a replacement.  There might possibly be better sounding phones for the same price, but I can say that these are comfortable and have lasted a long time and sound good enough for most purposes.  I don't think that you could do much better for the price.Update:I have had them for about 5 years and they finally broke. I am going to replace them with the same model. I use these at work and the in-line volume control is important to me in my work situation.  I can say from 5 years of experience that they are durable, comfortable and the volume control held up well for me.  The sound quality is adequate.  If you don't care about the volume control feature, as most people probably won't, you might want to spend a bit more on better sounding ones. For $20, I don't think that you could do very much better.  If you are after top sound quality, you probably aren't looking at these anyway, but I recommend the  Sennheiser HD555.  That is what I use at home.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Comfortable, durable, sound pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1329696000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2012"}
