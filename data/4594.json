I'd like to give them a break for only being $20, but considering the fact that these are practically unusable without a high boost and mid cut EQ, it's hard to justify the purchase.  I just do not know why these lack so much high end and boost the 250-500k frequencies so much.  After cutting these frequencies in iTunes, they don't sound bad, but you shouldn't have to run an EQ to get a decent sound.  Only thing I like about these is the inline volume control.Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a higher end model.  You'll be happy you did.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Really awful sound", "unixReviewTime": 1294012800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2011"}
