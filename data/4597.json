Lightweight, pretty sturdy, and stay on your head well. Best of all, they don't get too sweaty.Cons:- After a couple years of light use, ear pads will wear out and start shedding little bits of black crud. Replacement ear pads cost $6 to $12.- Poor at blocking out external sounds, since they don't cover the entire ear. They'd be lousy for office use, since they offer no real isolation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worth the price; they're decent.", "unixReviewTime": 1380326400, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2013"}
