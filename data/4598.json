The sound quality is superb!  My Ipod tones are much louder and richer, and I have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing I had more volume with those annoying Ipod earbuds.Please do not purchase this Sony headphone from the Apple website, or you will wind up paying about 20 dollars more for it after base price, tax and shipping.  Sony has another winner in these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "FIRST RATE HEADPHONES!", "unixReviewTime": 1166313600, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2006"}
