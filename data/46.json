Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product for a great price!", "unixReviewTime": 1361059200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2013"}
