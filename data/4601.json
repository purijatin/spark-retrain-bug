They are a nice mid-sized, not too big not too small, ear cup. They are not over ear cups, the padding will rest on your ears...but they are good enough to not be uncomfortable after hours of listening. The band is sturdy and the size does not squeeze on my head.STYLE:Nice and not overly bulky like the over-ear headphones. The ear cups swing in and up for portability, but they dont fold flat. The cord is VERY long. I usually keep mine bundled up with a rubber band so it's not all over my workspace.SOUND:These are no BOSE, but given that and the low cost...the sound is actually very good. Bass is respectable but not earth-shattering. Mids and highs are clear and seem to sound pretty good from my novice perspective. I listen to all sorts of music and haven't noticed any distortion at any range and only sometimes wished for a little more bass.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great middle price-range headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1262131200, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2009"}
