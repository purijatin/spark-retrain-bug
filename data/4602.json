The bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoe-goo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece.  That is to say, the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it doesn't move.  The over-the-head thing is taped together with packaging tap because it, too, broke when I put the things on my rather large head.  They sound fine and all, but I could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood.  Do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase.Maybe I should just glue to the earpieces to my head.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "CPC: Cheap plastic crap", "unixReviewTime": 1115856000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2005"}
