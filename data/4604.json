The Sony MDR-V300 Traditional Collapsible DJ Style Headphones fulfilled this requirement in the usual wonderful manner that Sony products so often do.As I lay in the tent watching movies with these outstanding headphones on, the audio tracks on the DVD's were played wonderfully, enhancing the movie watching experience to perfection, giving a theater style performance..  While these headphones do not drown out ambient noises completely as they're not advertised to do so, they do keep a majority of the ambient noises to a minimum making the experience that much better.For price and quality, one can hardly do better than to make the decision to purchase these outstanding headphones and I highly recommend them to any and all who find themselves in need of a good pair of headphones.  I expect to get several years of good use out of these headphones and have high confidence in the quality and high standard of performance in this, another outstanding Sony product!  {ssintrepid}", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V300 Headphones - Another outstanding Sony product!", "unixReviewTime": 1082160000, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2004"}
