He plays steel guitar, telecaster and records through professional equipment + pro tools.  These deliver an exceptional, above average sound quality that is markedly different than the lower model V150's (which we also have several of).  Over the years, my Dad wore these to bits.  The foam on the earpads was coming off completely and it was time for a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement model that is now available in the stores doesn't compare at all to these.  Thank goodness I was able to get them from Amazon marketplace.  I will probably buy yet another pair and put them away.  A great quality product at a great price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the best-- the new, replacement model doesn't compare!", "unixReviewTime": 1392768000, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2014"}
