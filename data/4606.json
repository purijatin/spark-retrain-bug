Sound quality (to my ears) is rather good and clean, with deep bass (very good for synthesized dance/electronic music or neo soul music which are usually bass heavy, but my Jazz and Rock sounds great too).Lightweight, it fits snugly over my head and onto my ears and in an office or home environment, blocks out most of the surrounding sound, leaving you to hear just your music. It doesn't block out much subway or airplane noise though.On the downside, the much touted foldability doesn't fold it down to miniscule proportions as I'd hoped, and I find I have to wind up and tie up the 3m long cord. Other than these minor gripes, I'm a happy camper!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not perfect, but very good!!", "unixReviewTime": 1192579200, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2007"}
