Deep deep bass doesn't penetrate that loudly with these phones, they still are better than everything else in their price and size range.Most suited for portable digital music  devices.  Some of the other &quot;studio&quot; headphones suck up all your  portable player's amperage, this one needs less juice to give you louder  sound.I use them with a mp3/fm player, and have found that the mdr's  long cord makes for great FM reception, (even when most of its length is  folded up somwehere).These headphones have a weak spot on the headband  where two peices of plastic meet.  I broke it on one side, duck-taped it  fixed, and then broke it on the other side as well, (just for stuffing it  in to a jacket pocket).  So don't test the plastic.  It can't take  pressure.Before you get these ones, look at the Sony MDR-501LP  headphones listed in 'similar products'.  They look like great sounding  headphones...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "meant for house- not meant for pocket- good for music.", "unixReviewTime": 958780800, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2000"}
