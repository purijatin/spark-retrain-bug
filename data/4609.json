Bass is weak.  Extremely fatiguing.I own or have owned just about every high end headphone on the market.  Overall these are better than most $35-40 headphones, but both the Koss Porta Pro and Sennheiser PX100 in the same price range are vastly more musical, lighter weight and more portable.However, the reason I keep these around is because I have never found a better headphone for TV watching or listening to spoken recordings.  I can make out very clearly with little strain, exactly what is being said.  They are quite comfortable and the long cord is nice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for TV Watching, Poor for Music", "unixReviewTime": 1233964800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2009"}
