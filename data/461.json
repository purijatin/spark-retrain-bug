You can end up paying for a Gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover.*) Dictionary is limited in its vocabulary, and you can't access the dictionary by itself, nor does it link to other words or references.This is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet. I'm sorry I bought it. I've never used a Kindle (nor will I ever) but besides the Kindles, if you want a GOOD reader, get a Sony T1. If you want a tablet, buy a real tablet.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "SubPar", "unixReviewTime": 1322438400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2011"}
