The quality of the construction is great!  For the price of the headphones, you are getting a steal!It comes with a 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; adapter, and all contacts are gold-plated.  The headphones can fold in for easier storage, and the cable is super long, just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system).I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones, and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound quality, highly recommended", "unixReviewTime": 991612800, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2001"}
