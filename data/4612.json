I am sort of an audiophile, but when i bought a $35 headphones, i did not expect the moon and the stars. Sad to say i was let down. the basic headphones that came with my discman sound clearer than these.Tried them out with my Dell Laptop, Sony Discman and Harman Kardon amp. Bad performance in every case. Allowed 20 hours of break in, still only slight difference. They sound as if the music is lost somewhere within and all you hear are muffled thuds. This is not at all expected from a respected brand like Sony. I would give a total thumbs down to this product.If all you want to hear is boom and dont care about clarity or balance in sound then maybe this is for you, else stay away. I am returning mine.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Totally Disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1111622400, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2005"}
