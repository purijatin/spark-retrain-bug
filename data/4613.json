Even with both headphone &amp; master volume maxed on my mixer (pre-amp), I find myself struggling to hear what's happening on the channel B while channel A is playing over the speakers.Kick in the extra cash and get the v700s, which outperform these in every way possible and are much better suited for live performance use.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for a set of headphones for home use, these are a reasonable consideration.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too quiet for their intended use", "unixReviewTime": 1041984000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2003"}
