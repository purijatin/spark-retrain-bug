Highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit.  Construction is really durable, I like how there's no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player.  If you fall asleep with headphones on like the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 that have an exposed cable above the earcup you'll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it.  Not so with these cans.  Also the cable is nice, thick, and it's coiled.The BAD:  It's almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite.  Even at just 50% volume on my Zune people across the room can hear what I'm listening to.  This is a big reason I don't like these.  If you don't care if you annoy people I guess it's ok.They can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions (like after 45 min or so), sometimes near the end of an album I have to take a break.  The headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head.  It's fine for short sessions.I actually had a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 before these.  I fell asleep in them too often and the problem I described earlier with the cable happened so I got these to replace them.  I liked the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them.  They were about the same price, but they were much more comfortable and sound was better ten-fold.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A bit uncomfortable, but OK sound quality, loud", "unixReviewTime": 1267920000, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2010"}
