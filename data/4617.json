Parmelee", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "After talking to my brother about how much I love my Sony MDR 7506s and even letting him try them on he told me he wanted a pair just like them but I didn't have the money to order them for him for Christmas my dad went to Best Buy and bought him these DJ V500s. While half the price of the 7506s the V500s are probably the best headphones that you can get for 50$. I won't tell them this but I think that the 7506s,V6s and even the Sony V600s sound better than these and are more durable. However since he loves them and they're cheap it seems like a good deal for him but after reading how easily these DJ headphones break I really don't think these are worth replacing with the same model once every year especially when the 7506s sound at least twice as good and can last several years longer.If the V500s break every year I may just have to convince my parents to buy him the same model of headphones I own(which I saved up for and bought with my own money).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not the same as MDR 7506/V6 but my brother loves them.", "unixReviewTime": 1263772800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2010"}
