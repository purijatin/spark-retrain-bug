My first headset last me more than 10 years. That is with normal wear and tear. Its worth it. The price is not expensive and generally can't be compared with expensive Bose headphones or the higher headset from Sony.  It perfectly price for it purpose, not expensive and works better than the ear bugs piece.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great quality headphones --", "unixReviewTime": 1306713600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2011"}
