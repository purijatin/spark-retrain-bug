I've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me. No matter how hard the bass drop, No matter how long a Trance chorus, They've never popped a speaker and never quit. If you're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these. Armin Van Buuren doesn't use them for no reason, and other Professional DJ's know where its at; Sony MDR-V700's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They never fail me", "unixReviewTime": 1350000000, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2012"}
