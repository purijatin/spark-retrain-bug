The ear cups can be comfortably moved around on your ears as well as worn in a way that lets you listen in on one piece while hearing the output on external speakers. They can also be folded in for easy traveling and are light for their size. As for the sound, hip-hop and house music sounds great although I wouldn't use these for jazz or classical. And although these cans were not introduced as noise-cancelling headphones, they do a very good job at it anyway. I've used them while traveling on flights as well as on subways and almost never hear outside noise. Plus, they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable. Overall, great product for recording/mixing or general listening purposes.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great headphones for home or professional use", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}
