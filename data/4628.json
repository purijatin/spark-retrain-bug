The fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus. The cord is a 10 foot coiled cord that does carry some weight but is not to much to handle. The ear cup design is great, most sound becomes blocked out even before the music starts. The leakage isn't bad when the cups are over your ears but it does leak if a cup is exposed. The overall construction is pretty solid. They are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty. They flip up out and in nicely making a perfect fit for one under the chin or on the back of the head if you are trying to que up. You will hear sounds that you didn't know exsisted before. I'm not making that up either. These headphones are designed for DJ's to use while playing, that means they have to hear every line in the song. I've seen some people say that they aren't good for portability but I say their wrong. Yeah they are big headphones but no less portable than the over-rated Beats By Dre that take up just as much space. I highly recommend these head phones to any one willing to get rid of their ear buds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than most $300+ Headsets", "unixReviewTime": 1311724800, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2011"}
