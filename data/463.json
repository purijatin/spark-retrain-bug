Rockett", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The Nook Color is a reasonably priced device that will allow you to download multiple books and store them as well as access email.Right now it only has one book in it and has not been used for email since we have three computers readily accessible. I had a D-Link router which the Nook could never \"lock onto\" via wifi, so I changed the router to a Cisco, Linksyn which solved the wifi problem. Downlaoding books from Barnes & Noble is a little too easy once you set up an account with them and the books are somewhat expensive considering they are only electronic and intangible ($14.00 for a 300+ page book).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nook Color", "unixReviewTime": 1344643200, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2012"}
