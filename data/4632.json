They are very clean and appealing to the eye - and they fit on your skull like a glove.  They seem fairly durable but who knows - they may break tomorrow... that would be a con.The sound is pretty clean and detailed at high volumes, but definitely distorts at very high volumes... especially with the bass up.Bass is not as impressive as you would hope for this price, but bass isn't everything.  The full-range acoustics are nothing short of a amazing in comparison to other the cheap sets I've owned.Pros - style, fit, storage, crisp full soundCons - semi-fragile, poor bass, tight fit on head, distortion at high volumes** UPDATE **(December 24, 2012) These haven't broken yet - guess they aren't as fragile as I though.  They still work great and have gone through mild abuse.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "best headphones i've ever owned...", "unixReviewTime": 1135468800, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2005"}
