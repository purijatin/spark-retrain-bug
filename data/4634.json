I listen primarily to classical music, but these are good for Rock and Pop as well. The bass is big, deep, and roomy.  Your amplifier doesn't need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion. Even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble.  The bass doesn't overpower the rest of the frequency range. Right now I am on the fence as which I would recommend: these Sony 700's or the Sony 7506's.  The 7506's just seem a tad more accurate.  If you are into Rock or Pop more and like beefier bass then I would opt for the 700's.  I have no long term use with either.  So I will defer to others as far as long term durability.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Only For DJ's and Even For Classical", "unixReviewTime": 1226793600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2008"}
