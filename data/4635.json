It causes too much pressure on your head and hurts just a few minutes after putting them on. Also the cups make way too much heat, and you can barely stay with them on after an hour or so.It may be a good headphone for DJs (that are constantly putting them on and off), but for continuous usage there may be better options.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "excellent quality, but big, heavy and too hot", "unixReviewTime": 1215302400, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2008"}
