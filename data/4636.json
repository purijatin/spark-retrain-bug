If you're mainly doing techno and house stuff, you might as well go with the much cheaper Sennheiser HD505, not for sale anymore.They have the Sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505's. SOundwise they sound about just as good, little less mids, just as loud (if not louder), just as good lowend, crisper brights. I find the senheisers better sounding than these sony's, although these sony's sound more linear, less crisp, more evened out in sound.these sony's are better for overall listening, like a variety of styles ranging from classic,to jazz, to pop etc... The Senheisers are better for techno, house, pop, dance, r&b;, hiphop etc...If I can compare these 2 headphones (as they're all I have to compare eachother with),I'd go for the senheisers, because they're less than a quarter the price of these sony's and overall just as good.If you're an audiophile, wanting to get the best, obviously these sony's are better, but not by much. In fact, most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to A/B them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but costly", "unixReviewTime": 1336780800, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2012"}
