My MDR-CD580 set has been flying colors all the way, so Sony may as well have already had my money for these. In hindsight, I should have shopped more or been willing to spend more money.I'm not a DJ but I selected these based on the specs for sound quality. Great sound they have in abundance, comfort they do not. My ears got quite uncomfortable and did so quite quickly. I had some foam padding handy, so I cut some foam rings and inserted them under the covers and now I can wear them longer. They still get uncomfy after a while but it's not as bad.My only other con is the cord. It would have been nice if it were removable and it would be more functional to me if it were not coiled. I'd rather have the slack than the tension.Since I have not owned these for a long time, I can't speak for the structural integrity issues that I've read about, but I don't really travel with them. With any luck I'll get more than a few years out of them.If you don't plan to use them for long periods of time, or if you have some spare foam padding lying around, you might have trouble finding better sounding headphones for the price. The 50mm drivers make a noticeable difference.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great on sound... but not great on the ears", "unixReviewTime": 1102464000, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2004"}
