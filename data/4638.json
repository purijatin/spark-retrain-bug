I use them for music, games, movies, and tv shows that I play on my computer and the sound is terrific. They have just the right amount of bass, and are really good for games especially. I would recommend these headphones to anyone. In order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if you're careless. Overall, these headphones are a great purchase and I will buy these again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony Headphones Review", "unixReviewTime": 1216771200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2008"}
