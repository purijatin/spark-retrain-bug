The sound quality is far superior to the JVC and the music doesn't sound like its coming from a tin can.My only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned, the comfort. After a little while the phones become painful around the ears. This may be due to the weight or the design. Still, I will use these headphones as long as they last or I cant stand the discomfort any longer.As far as the cost, I bought mine for $36.00 direct from China via EBay. Not bad.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound but uncomfortable to wear over long periods", "unixReviewTime": 1200960000, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2008"}
