I have long since let mine go, but I regret it everyday.  I recently got some skullcrushers and I think they're okay, for the price, but man.. I really wish I still had these.  I have to say though, some of these prices are kinda outrageous, but they hold up really well, so a gently used one is a very good option.  Good luck, and keep on the beat!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unfortunately discontinued, but very awesome.", "unixReviewTime": 1372464000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2013"}
