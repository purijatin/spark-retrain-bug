I'm a DJ, but now find myself toting these around everywhere because I just don't want to listen to my music without them. My fiance is not a DJ, but steals these from me all the time.- They can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion.- They are sturdy, have a coily cord that's only connected at the left ear, and fold neatly into a little bad (included).- They totally block out outside noise. At a gig, you can't hear what you're pumping over the speakers if you don't want to. At a coffee shop, no one can tell your music is outrageously loud.- Intense rich bass. Even when you really crank the volume, it's like the bass vibrates your head, instead of blasting your eardrums.A really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume, and hold the ear cups together. You can barely hear a thing, but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands. When you open them, you'll be shocked at how much volume they're putting out.One last note, I bought the 1000's, was disappointed, and bought these. Definitely the way to go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The perfect headphones for DJ's, anybody", "unixReviewTime": 1166400000, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2006"}
