Sennheiser prides itself on making a flat EQ (meaning, typically not much bass.) If you're a bass hound just sick with these Sonys. I had a high end pair of Denon's too and they weren't as all around good as the Sony's in my opinon. With the 50mm drivers you can actually feel them vibrating on your head with a good bass lick --- I've never felt that with any pair of headphones.  They are quite comfortable too!Use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay. There are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison, but look like a very good counterfeit. Most negative reviews on these headphones have GOT to be from the chineese knockoff imitations sold new and used on ebay, because my set is over a year old now and work perfectly after being dropped a couple times even.  They are durable, and IMO of very high quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best bass hound headphones I've heard", "unixReviewTime": 1292025600, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2010"}
