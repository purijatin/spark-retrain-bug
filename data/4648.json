However, the low end response is not so good.  At normal listening levels, I would like a lot more bass response and it's not there.  If you crank up the volume, then the bass starts coming in.  But I don't listen to music that way.Hope this helps in making a decision.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought something different.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sounds good, but may not be what you want", "unixReviewTime": 1080345600, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2004"}
