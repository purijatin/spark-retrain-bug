I returned four different pairs of various brands before I bought these Sonys.  They blow the competition at this price away, and lots of more expensive models as well.  I've had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition.  I use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably.  The balance and sound quality are exquisite, and I don't hand out compliments that easily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth it even if they only last 2 years.", "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009"}
