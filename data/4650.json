I think they look really cool. I had to adjust the bass on my stereo because my ears were getting fatigued and gave me a headache, after I did that I didn't have the problem again. These are designed for DJ's. If you want something to listen to at home and you aren't worried about sound leakage get some open air cans. The  Sennheiser HD600 ($260) are some of the best around. If you really want closed headphones in $120 price range get the Sony MDR-V600 Studio Monitor Series Headphones. Sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart. It took me a lot of time and money before I found the sound experience I wanted. Always listen before you buy, everyone has different preferences in sound. If you are serious about music check out the Sennheiser HD 650, seriously amazing. You might consider pairing it with a headphone amp (this is not a portable setup). I'd check out the Schiit Asgard, they have a 15 day trial or something, but there are many, many other ones out there and you might be happy without out it. I picked up an old stereo receiver for $30.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "If you are a DJ you might like these.", "unixReviewTime": 1134259200, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2005"}
