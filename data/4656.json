I am no audiophile but I can hear my 128 kbps mp3 files far better on these headphones as compared to my Creative I-Trigue L3800 (2.1) speakers. And by \"light user\" I mean AT LEAST one hour of use everyday. Because these perform better than my desktop speakers I have them plugged in pretty much all the time. The extra long, single-sided cord is useful even for home use (though its really a lot sometimes!). And I dont need to set my mp3 player volume greater than 25% of max (iAudio X5) to get excellent sound.Yes I agree they are not built that solid. Even though mine are in great condition, you can still feel its mostly plastic. But I have traveled with these headphones and I have also fallen asleep wearing them. I have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cups/padding. Maybe I just got lucky!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the light user.", "unixReviewTime": 1179273600, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2007"}
