I use them for my studio work. Sound is completely isolated when they're on your head or cupped together, so there's very little bleed. They are a little tight, so if you have a fat head, these might not be for you. They look great, but handle them with a bit of care, since they are plastic and seem a little prone to breaking due to the many moving parts.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable and Sound Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1163030400, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2006"}
