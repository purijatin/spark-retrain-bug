First, I've owned several different headphones in past, the last being the Sony MDR-V6. I thought it would be impossible to improve on them...but Sony has done it.Comfort: The 700s are all-day comfortable. The earcups fit AROUND your ears, so there is no annoying pressure there. The headband is nicely padded too, so you simply forget you're wearing anything at all. They are 'hefty' and robustly constructed, yet that weight simply disappears once you put them on. They're attractively designed, too...with a professional style.Sound quality: Like I said earlier, Sony has worked magic here. The resolution and detailing these phones provide will have you hearing things \"for the first time\"...you'll hear things in music you never knew existed. I am pulling things out of my collection and literally enjoying them for the first time. The bass extension is phenomenal...a concert bass drum-smack or pipe organ will have you giggling like a kid! But they don't stop there...the mids and highs are equally well-produced.The phones are fairly sensitive too...my small headphone amp drives them quite nicely to db levels that doctors would tell you \"no-no!!\" But they sound so good...you wanna keep cranking the volume!Sony thoughtfully provided a nice long cord, too...it's coiled so it doesn't get in the way.Oh, my...the kickdrum in Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks\" just about blew my eyeglasses off! Yeehaw!!Buy them...you will not regret it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best I've heard!", "unixReviewTime": 1213920000, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2008"}
