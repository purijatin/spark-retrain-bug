It looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before.  I am a DJ who loves music, and use these for all my work, and these have awesome sound.  There are a few problems with them, however.  If you're a DJ who monitors loudly, and you forget to turn them down after mixing, the drivers can and will eventually blow!  In addition, the round plastic cylinders with the L and R labels at the top of them break, and that is why I finally had to buy a new pair, but not bad for 5 years of use and abuse!Sound quality wise, if you're not a DJ there are better headphones out there.  If money is no object, get the Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones, much better, and filters out all the sound around you!  But if you're a DJ, these headphones are a MUST!!!! I've talked to hundreds of other DJ's, and they all have bought the Denons, Technics, Pioneer, and other brands of DJ headphones that cost the same or more, and they have all told me that those headphones DO NOT HOLD UP as good as the Sony's did.  Too bad the DJ headphone makers don't take note of this and make a better quality product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My first pair lasted me 5 years..", "unixReviewTime": 1171152000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2007"}
