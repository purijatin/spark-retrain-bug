I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1296086400, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2011"}
