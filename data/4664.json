Hickner", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I'm not exactly a headphone connoisseur but I can tell you that these headphones have impressive sound. I upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds. The bass on these things is quite strong (its actually rather painful at anything too high). However, if you read the reviews for these things you will find that the common theme is that they break around the swivel thing. I was determined to be the dude who takes good care of his headphones and doesn't break them. NOT SO. Although these are some of the sexiest phones around, THEY ARE NOT MADE TO LAST. The plastic on the hinge/swivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose. Mine lasted only about a month. The sound still sounds fine, but the swivels are in shambles. DONT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT THEM FOR LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. FOR THE PRICE, THE LONGEVITY OF THESE IS A SHAME.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Very poor construction", "unixReviewTime": 1144022400, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2006"}
