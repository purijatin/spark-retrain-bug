I compare it to my Denon AHD 1001S. The Sony sound presentation was \"GOOD\", however I was not engaged with the music and recording like with the Denon. The Sony does produce an accurate sound presentation. The sound didn't have a heavy colored bass or treble (Neutral). The Sony may not be an audiophile headphone, definitely it is a great studio monitor DJ headphone.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cheap Closed Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1284681600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2010"}
