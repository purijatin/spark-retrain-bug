The old ones still sound GREAT, but unfortunately I didn't bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well, so they started cracking, and after dropping them, one of the swivels stopped working, so they didn't stay on right.With minimal precautions, you too can make these last for years and years - just apply some leather protector once in a while, and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor. These things are the best headphones I've ever owned, and it was well worth another $100 to purchase a second pair. The first pair served me well, and actually sound great still - they're just not comfortable, due in NO part to the quality of the headphones themselves.They are solid, and it's nice to have a cord on only one side. It really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each side.Highly recommend these even for those of you who aren't DJs. These are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk. I can't hear A THING, and people are always waving their arms at me to get my attention.These have an amazing level of bass, better than any I have heard in any headphones before. It's an experience, these are.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still going strong after SIX YEARS", "unixReviewTime": 1161561600, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2006"}
