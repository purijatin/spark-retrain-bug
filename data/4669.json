So I ordered one for myself and one for my friend.  The products arrived in good condition.I started testing it with many of my audio and video collections both from my laptop and MP3 player and the sound quality was top notch.  Like many other reviewers I too heard several new sounds from the same old songs!!  The bass is excellent and at the same time high end instruments are also heard very clearly.  Excellent purchase for the pricing (about $84 from Amazon) with free shipping except for the below issue.But then I found an issue with my head set and my friend's one too has the same problem.  It is the clicking noise which I can clearly hear in my ears when the cup moves if I move my jaw or my ears involuntarily.  And many times I hear that even when I move my head but not all the times.  This is fine during music but too annoying to me during movies.  I have a good sized head (!) and there is no play when the headphone sits on my head.  It is having a very good fit.Haven't seen others writing about this.  Can anyone share their opinion?  Mine are just 5 days old and I am worried if this will increase over period of time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good audio quality but annoying hinge noise", "unixReviewTime": 1326844800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2012"}
