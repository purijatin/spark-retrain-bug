It does a few things well, like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights.  After that it is all downhill.  Battery life is about that of a really long life laptop.  At the store they told me not to expect anything better than 8 hours.  And if you are not connected to wifi like I was not at a cabin for 2 weeks you can't even set the time, there is no function to do that.  I mean really...  and if you want to archive a book you can't because that is only an on-line function.  Any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop.  In bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade.  If you are not connected to wifi and your book expires, then the little book icon gives you a message that says \"The content is no longer available\".  What that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi, after which it miraculously fixes itself.All in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house, but for traveling its not worth lugging around.  Really, why even use it around the house when I have a fast laptop already that does a lot more.  This thing is just not ready for prime time, paper books beat it hands down.  Get a good LED book reader light and keep your $.I asked at the store if I could return it and they said only within the first 2 weeks with a receipt, so buyer beware...big time!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Disappointing in almost every way", "unixReviewTime": 1313712000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2011"}
