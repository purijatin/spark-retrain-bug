What happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these, the swivel cups/plastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your head....they will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfr's warranty!Countless other DJ's will tell you the same thing, save your money and get something better -- the HD 280's sound better, fit better, and give you more value for your money.  They are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceable....unlike Sony's 700's.  Do the right thing, don't buy these! You'll be happy you listened to my advice!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Buy the HD 280 Senns Instead!", "unixReviewTime": 1058313600, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2003"}
