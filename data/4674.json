I'm not an audiophile but I do have a pair of headphones on during most of the day. Playing computer games (WoW, COD, Fallout, etc) and listening to music, watching videos I prob average wearing these headphones for about 4-5 hours a day. My beef is they are not comfortable wearing beyond a 1 hour duration. The combination of having the ear padding too soft/short and the pressure that they put on each ear I have to take them off after because of the pain they produce wearing for long periods of time. I still use them on a daily basis, mostly because they were so expensive to buy in the first place I can't just set them off to the side and use something else. But after using these for a few months I might have to second hand sell them and look for something else that's more comfortable. To your average user these will be a good set of headphones, but to the guy like me who wears headphones for most of the day, I'd suggest looking for a more comfortable set of headphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good headphones, uncomfortable wearing for extended periods", "unixReviewTime": 1311120000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2011"}
