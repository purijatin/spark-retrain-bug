I couldn't disagree more. I hate dance, rap and anyting to do with a club or DJ. These phones are excellent for rock or anything i've tested them on. Tried out Hendrix, Floyd, Zeppelin, Metallica, Megadeth, Marley, Janes Addiction, Maiden and more and I have absolutely no complaints. I can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin' good it blows me away. I cannot compare the 7506's but may have purchased those if I had done more research first. You really can't go wrong with these. I can't speak for the durability but after reading the reviews I will not fold them up and plan on using them at home 95% of the time. The sound quality of these is astounding. Don't believe the negative rants....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These things ROOOOOOOOCK!", "unixReviewTime": 1324080000, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2011"}
