Smith \"Aarowsmith\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "No the Sony MDR-V600 does not compare to the Sony MDR7506 model at all. In fact the V600 model has much more quality sounding bass, much smoother sounding mid range, and a higher high end.In fact the Sony MDR7506 headphones are very flat sounding and I suppose they are made only for studio monitoring and recording and mastering. But I am sure the MDR7506 are not good for either purpose. Just look at the frequency response specs and they will tell you the real difference between the two of these headphones. One is for music and the other I am not sure what they are good for ? I own the MDR7506 and they sound completely flat and dull, completely lifeless.These headphones are comfortable but can get hot in the summer, its pleather and not real leather. I suppose if you are real handy you can make real leather ear pads for this and sell them too online ? Anyone here listening ?You can replace the ear pads when they wear out. But do not buy the eBay replacement ear pads, they do not fit right and easily slip off. Not even the same quality as the original Sony ear pads. I suggest getting them from Sony instead.I use to use these Sony MDR-V600 headphones for listening to all music, studio mixing, and for recording vocals etc. But now I prefer exclusively the JVC HARX700 headphones instead, they are the most accurate and perfect sounding headphones I have ever heard. The JVC HARX700 blows away anything Sony produces at any price, the quality of the build is excellent, and are more comfortable, and at 1/8 the price of these Sony headphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "No the Sony MDR-V600 does not compare to the Sony MDR7506 model", "unixReviewTime": 1356825600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2012"}
