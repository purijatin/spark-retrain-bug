When I first got them, they were better than my other headphones I used to own.  These headphones have some serious bass and treble, and DJ's still use these headphones.  They are great for part 15 broadcasting, and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song.  They are good for remixing, shuffling music, and running a small FM or AM station.  Also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator.  They are the best!  I hope I can get another pair soon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Used To Have These Along Time Ago", "unixReviewTime": 1317945600, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2011"}
