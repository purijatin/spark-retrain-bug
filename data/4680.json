There is a bit of wear and tear and I take good care of my things.  They were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up.  the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit, but it does not affect sound quality or comfort.so lets see, 7 years at $70.  At $10 a year, I am very happy with this purchase.EDIT (6/14/11):I still have these though I don't use them very often. Too bulky and the cord is very long. They still sound great though after all these, wow 13+ years! These things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes. In other words, they have held up better than a slightly neglected pet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love these things.", "unixReviewTime": 1129248000, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2005"}
