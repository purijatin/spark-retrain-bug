I'm not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers, but I love to listen to music. My office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick.After a full 8 hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them, but I usually don't wear them all day. The ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material. The sound is amazing! I think I can hear more music through these headphones than I do my stereo system at home.Cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks. It is long enough to plug into my PC and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to PC with no troubles.Great buy, I am really impressed with these headphones. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1229817600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2008"}
