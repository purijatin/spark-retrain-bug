The highs are crystal clear, the mids unmuddy, and the bass is pretty good (although I personally found it a bit underpowered, which is why these receive only four stars, and not five).  Perhaps more importantly, these headphones are extraordinarily comfortable and fit snugly around your ears, making them ideal for home use and extended listening (unlike the v700s, which are designed to be used during live DJ performances, and therefore be worn mostly over only one ear).If you're an average home user looking for a great set of headphones to listen to your mp3 collection or your big, booming new DVDs with, these are the ones for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent blend of quality and price", "unixReviewTime": 1041984000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2003"}
