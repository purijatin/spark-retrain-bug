There is absolutely NO comparison with the first, because this one has to be approximately 284x better. The bass, like everyone said, is crisp and clear, but not exactly booming with the lows. In other words, it's not the same as car subs. The sound quality, however, is absolutely incredible. I'm able to hear certain noises in music and gaming that I haven't ever heard from my speakers.The headphones aren't technically noise cancellation, but I can't hear a single thing anyone is saying when they're standing next to me. I don't even have the noise that loud!There are a couple complaints I have about this product, but they are minor. First, the design of the headphones are shaped to fit ones ears. Because of that, it isn't possible to wear them the other way. Luckily, the cord is very long and coils up so it won't tangle up. The second complaint I have is that my ears become extremely hot and uncomfortable after just 30 minutes or so. To combat that, I just take them off for a good 10 seconds and it's fine again. It does get annoying though.I'm no audiophile so I can't judge the quality in comparison to other headphones, but I would MOST CERTAINLY buy this product again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not perfect, but damn near it.", "unixReviewTime": 1309824000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2011"}
