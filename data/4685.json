I have not been disappointed. If you are looking to combine your digital music listening experience (CDs, MP3s, etc) with a top notch pair of headphones or looking to enhance your movie watching experience (on a laptop for example) with a state of the art pair of headphones, look no further.The highs and the lows are captured perfectly, adding a hithero unknown dimension to your listening (and viewing) pleasure. You certainly cannot go wrong with the price either!Be warned, however, that these headphones are heavy. While, not a problem, should you be sitting in one place and listening to the audio, by no means will you be comfortable walking around in these headphones. (Hence the four and not five stars.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Incredible Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1076371200, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2004"}
