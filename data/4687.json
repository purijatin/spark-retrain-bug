Bolin", "helpful": [29, 38], "reviewtext": "After owning these headphones for over 6 months I can tell you that they just don't compare at all to the Sony MDR-V6 model. The overall sound quality is muddy, flat, and lifeless. The bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper mid-bass rather than a smooth, tight, and deep bass. The mid-range sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound. Highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise. If you're buying these mainly to listen to music I'd suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad. I currently use the Sony V6s (not the V600s) for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramatic.The build quality and comfort of the Sony MDR-V600 is about all that is good about them. But, if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic Sony MDR-V6 model (many studios and radio stations use the Sony MDR-V6 or the Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring sound). They fold up just like the MDR-V600s and are just as comfortable.If sound quality is important to you then avoid the Sony MDR-V600 headphones like the plague. They're horrible.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Get the Sony MDR-V6 headphones if you want accurate sounds", "unixReviewTime": 1078876800, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2004"}
