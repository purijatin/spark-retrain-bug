I've never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this. Listening to music with this is quite superb; the bass, mid-range and highs are all equally there.As for the build quality, these have definitely stood the test of time. The original fabric-like material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn away--this DOES NOT affect sound quality. In fact, I think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty. The cord looks like the day I got it, the printing on the plastic has not worn away.The only minor issue (and this is mainly because I've read about it from others), is creaking sound when turning your head. The cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending. Again, I never really noticed it until others pointed it out.I haven't had to replace these for 13 years so gather what you will from that statement. I do not *need* new headphones, but I am window shopping should these ever break (and I hope they don't!). I originally bought these for $90 so I'm not sure why it's now $200+. If you can get them at a good rate I do recommend these fantastic headphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "13 years of great quality sound from this headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}
