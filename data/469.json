A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader.  While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption.  As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan.  You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment).  Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Quality Hardware, Decent Interface, Lackluster App Support", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"}
