Recently my wife was telling me that I had black dandruff and would knock a few very small pieces of some kind of black material from the side of my face. It took 2 months to realize that the specs were coming from the headphone covers. They were slowly deteriorating.The good news is that there are replacement covers for just a few bucks.
