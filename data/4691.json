The MDR-V6 is the one that is comparable to the mdr-7506, NOT the v600. If you are not familiar with the MDR line, I can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers. I own the V6 and my brother owns the MDR-7506 and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what I can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound. The MDR-V600 can be described as the black sheep in the family, since it looks, feels, and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblings.The MDR-v600 is much bigger and bulkier than both the V6 and the mdr-7502. While it uses similar drivers, It has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound. Most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out, which drowns out the mids. This would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described. So how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me. This headphone is more like a pair of v6 that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads. Whereas v6 was half metal/half plastic, the v600 is all plastic. On the plus side, the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the V6/7502.If you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors, stick with the tried and true Sony models such as the v6 or 7502. Since the late 80's, these were among the most widely used monitor headphones in the TV and radio industry.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V600 does not equal MDR-V6", "unixReviewTime": 1115337600, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2005"}
