Awesome sound reproduction. Very \"true\" reproduction for those of us who scoff at the BASS BOOST buttons.  I used both primarily for live sound mixing. But after these it is hard to use anything else in you MP3 player.  The size adjustment keeps them comfortable. The flip earphone allows you to hold it up to your ear for a quick listen.The first pair was a travel pair and went on plane flights, car rides, remote shows. After excessive abuse, one of the ear phone joints broke.  I repaired it once and that lasted about 1 year.The second pair sits on the Board at our church.  They have been there for years. The ear phone foam is starting to flake off onto those of us with facial hair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My second pair", "unixReviewTime": 1320796800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2011"}
