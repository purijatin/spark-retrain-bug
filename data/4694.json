They sound great and are VERY comfortable, with a silky-smooth earcup lining that means you can wear them for hours.UNFORTUNATELY, that same, comfortable lining soon began to crack, and is now flaking off in pieces about the size of a dime. The headphones still sound good, are still comfortable, but quite a bit of thin, black plastic came off before I noticed the problem. Walking around with stuff like that stuck to the side of your head is not a fashion statement.Is is not sun-induced, as I use them only indoors. I think it may be some kind of fatigue from putting them on and taking them off. So far, it's only happened to the right earcup. The left remains intact.Maybe I just have very caustic skin oils, on one side of my head? I think not.I really liked these headphones soon after I bought them, but now that this has happened I just can't recommend them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good comfort, sound -- falls apart later", "unixReviewTime": 1255910400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2009"}
