Comfortable, quiet for others, true sounds reproduction.  I've worn it for, oh, maybe an hour straight, and it's big enough to be comfortable on my ears. It has no funny hissing or such.I am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers.  Sometimes too much tech knowledge can be a hindrance to good judgement  I, personalty, just wanted a middle priced quality headphone specifically for my amplifier for my high end guitars and ukuleles.  This is wonderful.  Love it.  Wish I could kiss it.  I think I will.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive for amplifier on guitar", "unixReviewTime": 1317945600, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2011"}
