The CD has a range of frequencies, from deep bass (down to as low as 20 Hz) to mid-range.  Also, since I travel frequently, the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones (by Sennheiser) died, I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint, with my old Sennheiser headphones, I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio, at slightly lower volume, than I can with these headphones.  Then again, the Sennheiser headphones cost $250, while these cost $70.However, my Sony headphones serve me very well.  They produce good (but not great) sound, so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume.  Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable, the top is padded, and the headphones themselves are lightweight, I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy, keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that, the headphones themselves are sturdy, standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch.  Also, they are very affordable (about $70 from Amazon.com).The only issue is, if I wanted headphones to use while working out, these headphones wouldn't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat.  However, for my non-workout needs, these are excellent.Although the audio isn't quite professional quality, these are an excellent set of headphones for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid value in headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1242172800, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2009"}
