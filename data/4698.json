I work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke LOUDLY.  That's great, except when I have a deadline.  I put these on and listen to a CD or the radio, and it shuts out the noise to the point where I can actually get some work done.  I think the sound quality is great.  The coiled cord is about 5 feet long or so and stretches out nicely.  Sony's page says the cord is 9.8 feet long, extended.  It allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled.  They are the only headphones I've been able to wear all day long without hurting my head.  I'd buy them again, especially at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable for hours", "unixReviewTime": 1069545600, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2003"}
