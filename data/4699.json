Do your research, Sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG.  These brands are, in my opinion, the best in the business.  After listening to jazz with my AKG 702 and switching over to the Sony, I feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard.  The sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my AKG.  Don't believe me?  Read all the bad reviews in any review web site, not just this site, and you will hear the same thing: muddy.  Sony headphones sound muddy.  I own 3 Sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics: loud, muddy, and bassy.  Now 1 and 3 are not bad qualities, but 2 is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound.  Now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are any good.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sony Sucks", "unixReviewTime": 1271030400, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2010"}
