I have tried the Sony MDR-V6s (bought a pair and gave them away... couldn't stand them), some expensive Shure in-ear headphones (I felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them), and some Sony MDR-7506s.In the end, the V600s work the best for me (so far). They have great sound reproduction, I can wear them for hours at a time (and I'm super sensitive... I could wear the V6s for about 1 hour a day before I had to take them off), and they are a great value. The plastics used in their construction seem to be good quality, and they are aesthetically pleasing (not incredibly so, but they are certainly not ugly).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great balance of features", "unixReviewTime": 1156982400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2006"}
