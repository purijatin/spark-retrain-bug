He hit me back w/ a link to the MDR-V600 for $83.99 so i bought them. Now i see the price is over double that. I can definitely undertand why. They have a really great sound quality even at the 200 dollar price tag. The highs are crisp and the bass hits deep. I've used them soley for the past 3 years and wear them sometimes for up to 8 hours w/ very little discomfort & obviously taking breaks throughout. They are also extremely durable and made w/ heavy duty plastic, cordage & parts and can definitely take some hits and drops. The cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio. Considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal, but regardless they are some headphones i'll probably use for atleast 2 or 3 more years. I can certainly say these are some of the best headphones i've ever owned. Overall comfort, durability & superb sound quality made these the perfect pair for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb Audio Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1365033600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2013"}
