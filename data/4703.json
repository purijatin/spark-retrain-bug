I use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies. I have had them for a few years now, and they still work just as good as the day i bought them. They have a nice long  cord, so you don't have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player. If you  are looking for a set of headphones, these are one of the best for its  price range.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for just about everything", "unixReviewTime": 958694400, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2000"}
