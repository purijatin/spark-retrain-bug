They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum. I was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds. I use these with a Yamaha receiver. They deliver very good sound with this receiver. The receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones. That is something you should consider when choosing any headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceptional Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1025222400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2002"}
