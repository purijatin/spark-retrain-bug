I have used them with some of the new audio 3-d sound that the higher levels of HOLOSYNC use and they were amazing.  The \"knock\" at the door and the \"whisper\" in one ear, on the demo CD, for the sound technology, I think it is called \"AudioPhonics\" made me jump thru the roof - the sound was SO REAL!  I think these headphones are very comfortable - they have the adapters - both small and large - that come with them, you don't have to buy separate ones, and the cord is long, flexible and coiled.  I thought Amazon had a VERY decent price for them, I've seen them at 2x or 3x the price.  No complaints at all - I really like them a lot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Holosync user", "unixReviewTime": 1186617600, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2007"}
