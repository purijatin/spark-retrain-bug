All sound is crisp and clear.  They are comfortable for many hours. I got them for sixty -six bucks. The ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so I bought replacements, for eight bucks. Hope to get many more years service out of them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Crisp clear sound and comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1377648000, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2013"}
