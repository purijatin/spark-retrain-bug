I went through whole decade with these, i saw headphone get smaller and smaller, now getting bigger and bigger. which is funny but i have had this pair and nothing go wrong with them,  can wear all day without problem.  i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding head phones that will last.  i see the price has double since i bought them last, but will being another pair whenever these go out if they ever do!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Head Phone bar none", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"}
