I also use them for privacy when watching tv in a \"full house\".  I'll let the audiophiles give the specs/high & lows/bass & treble reviews.  I bought these to replace my jbl-610's (see my review of those).  Yes I understand those were bluetooth and these are not.  I really didn't care that they were \"wire only\".  These headphones are VERY comfortable.  The giant earpads engulf your ears.  The leather (or what i'm guessing is leather) is very smooth.  I'm hoping for some durability there but I can't attest to it so early after purchase.  They are big enough that I don't have to extend the ear pads at all.  The headpiece is soft but solid.  No worries there.  I use mine at the desk so the cord is plenty long enough for me.  I haven't had them on a plane so I can't say how they will do on blocking out noise but I'm hopeful..... I'll update on that as it happens.  One last common man observation, and maybe I missed it in Amazon's description, the plug is a standard stereo sized plug but you can unscrew is and underneath is a 3.5mm plug.  Anyway really like them and for the price, you can't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones for the avg or maybe above avg listener", "unixReviewTime": 1307404800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2011"}
