I have both. I think the V600s are lighter weight, so a little more comfy for long sessions, or wearing all day in an office or something.The cord attached to only one side is great. The phones &quot;seal up&quot; really well, with a true closed-back design. If you squeeze the cups shut together, you can just barely hear them, even if it's cranked up to bust your eardrums. This, in spite of the fact that they are plastic. You CANNOT hear the outside world when these phones are at normal levels.  When they're cranked up, somebody could be shouting in your face, and you'd think they were lip-syncing.Besides being well-sealed, and loud, these phones give a big, smooth sound that won't give you a headache or have you wondering what you're missing. As another reviewer mentioned, they're very efficient, producing a ton of volume with very little power - and it's volume you can stand, unlike lesser models that will hurt your ears at similar decibel levels.If you're looking for the pro version - it's the 7506, and only available at musical/recording outlets. Here, all you have to do is click that button, and soon you'll be listening to headphones that I'd buy again and again if I lost or destroyed them...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Directly comparable to Sony 7506", "unixReviewTime": 1047427200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2003"}
