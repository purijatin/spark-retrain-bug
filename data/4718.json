Shafir", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewtext": "I ordered these after buying several (supposedly decent) pairs (and returning them).I love these. The sound is so clear - they sound great even turned up very loud (they have the capability to go much louder than I could ever stand) Vocals are super clear, while the subtlety of the other instruments and little bell sounds and stuff on the tracks can be heard very well. Nice bass also.I am like \"the princess and the pea\" when it comes to comfort, and THESE  THINGS ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE!! I can hardly feel them. I wear glasses, and other headphones pressed my glasses against my head which hurts, these don't.I don't think they mention it in the product description, but they do cancel alot of ambient noise -- my phone just rang, and I totally did not hear it with these on my head. Soooo.... I highly recommend these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best headhones I've ever had 5 stars(not4)", "unixReviewTime": 1208217600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2008"}
