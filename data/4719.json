Fulkerson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I have been using these headphones for nearly eight years, and they still sound incredible.  They catch the highest highs and lowest lows, and the construction is built to last.  I use these for DJing and I have hauled these headphones to countless clubs and gigs with nary a problem in all the years I've used them.  I also have a pair at home that sound great no matter what you're plugging them into, be it a stereo, an ipod, or a television set.  For the price, you simply cannot get a better pair of headphones for the price.  Buy with confidence!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones that last for years!", "unixReviewTime": 1253145600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2009"}
