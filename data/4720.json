But then a friend of mine recommended these, said I wouldn't regret it. I'm happy to say that he was right. Watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience. Brought out the best in my CDs and DVDs and the worst out of my low-bitrate MP3s. Every little click and hiss became clear as day. Found myself re-encoding a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates, but it was worth it. Best of all, they block quite a bit of outside noise. Great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environments.And that's not all. They pack neatly--they fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch, which is surprisingly durable. The headphones themselves have held up pretty well, but then I'm pretty gentle with them. The cord's plenty long and doesn't tangle easily. These little touches make all the difference.If you have more discerning tastes, you may be better served by something else more refined (and likely more expensive). But if you're looking to move up from cheapo $10 headsets, this is as good a place as any to start.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1107734400, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2005"}
