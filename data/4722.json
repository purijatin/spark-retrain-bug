I have replaced the ear cushions once, which was surprisingly easy to do.  I cannot imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy -- these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work I do.  I have tried several other pairs of high-end cans and I keep coming back to these.  I think I paid twice what you can find them for now, back in the day (I seem to remember a $125 price tag), and seriously contemplate, every few months, shelving a second pair for safekeeping.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The MDR-V6 vs MDR-V600 debate confuses me", "unixReviewTime": 1313712000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2011"}
