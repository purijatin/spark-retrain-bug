I know that one can always spend more money, but these worked just fine for me, but only for about four years. The left-hand side of the headphones just fell apart. One day, they were working fine, the next they break on me and become unusable, hanging by a single cord. I didn't use these every day, but only on occasion. I would have thought that they'd have lasted me 5-7 years, but I was way off.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but will die on you unexpectedly.", "unixReviewTime": 1384732800, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2013"}
