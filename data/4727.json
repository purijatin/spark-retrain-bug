I've been happy with all three, though if I had to pick, I'd take the V6s.  And I'm fairly critical when it comes to headphones.  Anyone trying to divine perfection among these three really needs to go audition all of them to see which they prefer.  They differ, but are comfortable, yield high-quality sound, and are well-made.  I wouldn't have a problem recommending any of them.  The differentiators are these: the V6 and 7506 are almost identical (though the 7506s are more expensive), are flatter in response and more suited to studio use.  The V600 is a mass-market headphone well-suited to general listening use with a sound that tends toward warmer and bassier.My current set of V600's is getting pretty tired, and I'll probably audition all three again myself.  To anyone reading reviews to figure out which to buy, my advice is to not over-analyze it - unless you already have a preference, buy whichever is the best deal at the time.  Chances are, you'll be more than happy.  Sony makes superb headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Buy Them", "unixReviewTime": 1234483200, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2009"}
