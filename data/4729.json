Tiring of that in my middle age, I decided to spring for something a bit better, but first checked with Amazon's reviews.  This led me to the MDR-V600 headset, which was about $80.  Should have done it a long time ago...  Money well spent!  Excellent volume range, comfortable, covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output.  I used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while I do other things.  Occasionally to practice piano/keyboard.  Like I said, money well spent, although I have only had them a couple months.  Other reviewers give high marks for longevity, so I expect they will be satisfying for me as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the price", "unixReviewTime": 1173312000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2007"}
