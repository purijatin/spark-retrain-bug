I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi.I really like everything about it, especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by B&N; or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit B&N; store for help.I would highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Great ebook Reader", "unixReviewTime": 1314662400, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2011"}
