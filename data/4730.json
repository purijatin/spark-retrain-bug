The only thing that I had happen, is the thin covering over the earphones, and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces.  I finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because I would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes.  Since I use them in loud environments, I can't really comment on sound quality.  They do block some sound (a little less now that the covering came off), which helps in loud areas.  The cord is coiled, and long, it has stretched out over time, so it's really long now, just make sure you don't wrap the cord around the phones tightly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Built to last", "unixReviewTime": 1338249600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2012"}
