In addition, since I can tell the difference between say, a 256kbps MP3 and a lossless version of the same song, I can still notice the same difference on these headphones. Yes, this is a matter of audio compression, but the point I'm trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression don't go unnoticed with these headphones.Very highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A review from a non-audiophile...", "unixReviewTime": 1109980800, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2005"}
