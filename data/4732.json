Kowalsky", "helpful": [23, 29], "reviewtext": "MDR-V6, MDR-7506, MDR-V600, MDR-EX71SL: I own all of these headphones, and I have to say that my 19 year old pair of Sony MDR-V6's, and especially my newer MDR-7506's, blow these MDR-V600's out of the water. While arguably a bit more comfortable for LONG sessions, the MDR-V600's sound thin and cold compared to the MDR-7506's. I gave my MDR-V600's away because I was even more disappointed with them once I bought the MDR-7506's. Kids, save your milk money for another week or two and buy some cans that are audiophile quality - the MDR-7506's. I have had mine for 5 years or so, and just recently replaced the ear-pads with Beyerdynamic velour pads and MAN oh MAN - the sound gets even better and the cans just got WAAAY more comfortable.  Buyer take note - do some reading on the \"can\" web sites and steer yourself towards a better Sony product than the mediocre MDR-V600's. Your ears will thank you, and you'll thank amazon.com for getting the MDR-7506's to you in record time. (NOTE: If you need something lighter and portable and it HAS to be Sony, try the MDR-EX71SL's - they sound decent, but they've had cord quality issues...)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "WHOA! Definitely NOT close to the MDR-7506 or MDR-V6!!", "unixReviewTime": 1134604800, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2005"}
