In fact, I have yet to discover an &quot;all-purpose&quot; pair.  Imagine an equalizer board with 8-16 slider switches adjustable in any number of configurations.  Boost the treble and upper mid-range while cutting back on the bass and you have the Panasonic 850's, which are perfect for concentrating on Ella's voice or Tony Williams' ride cymbal but not on Nelson Riddle's orchestral arrangements or Ray Brown's bass.The Sony MDR-V600's may be as close to a &quot;universal,&quot; accurate set of headphones as you can get for under a hundred and fifty.  Compared to my MDR-6's, which my son &quot;borrowed,&quot; they're more comfortable and the sound is more &quot;flat&quot; (i.e. accurate, faithful, undoctored).  If your tastes extend beyond contemporary pop and you're serious about sound &quot;fidelity,&quot; beware of those &quot;DJ&quot; models, with the bass boost, brain-shaker and virtual-reality features.  And as a previous reviewer has pointed out, this model is identical with the higher-priced &quot;professional&quot; phones Sony is listing as model 7506.  Perhaps Sony plans to make the 700's the only available models (call it &quot;cost-effective marketing), because there are currently some great deals on the MDR-V600's.My only &quot;complaint&quot; is the extreme degree to which the V600's seal off all outside sound, making me feel like I'm trapped in a cocoon (they're ideal for anti-social or solipsist personalities).  These phones are a pleasure now and then, but I'm still happy with my Sennheiser PX-100's for 80% of my listening.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Useful Reference Work", "unixReviewTime": 1084665600, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2004"}
