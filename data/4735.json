Since I don't edit often I did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when I edited and this does just that.  I was so impressed I took it out in the field with me on sets and it's great.  I can't hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great.  I love these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is great for it's price", "unixReviewTime": 1178928000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007"}
