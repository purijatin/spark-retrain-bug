I didn't realize that this was a blessing in disguise.  I purchased the V600 headphones as a replacement since they addressed my greatest complaint with the V300s: ear compression.  I use my headphones daily to listen to music while working in my cubicle.  This amounts to at least 3 hours of use, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year.  That's at least 780 hours of use per year.  I don't need my ears pressed up against my head by ill-fitting headphones.  The V600s have a circum-aural design that encloses all but the largest of ears.  They're comfy and sound super-fantastic.  I love these headphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sturdy Headphone with Great Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1113264000, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2005"}
