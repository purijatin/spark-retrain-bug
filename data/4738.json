My 7 year old has Autism and we bought this for one of his CD sessions. It was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine, drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his CDs. I want to get a pair myself!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1286323200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2010"}
