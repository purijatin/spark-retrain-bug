{"reviewerID": "A16F3IAR2659FN", "asin": "B00001W0DI", "reviewerName": "surfbass", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version, the MDR-7506, for more than 10 years as a professional field video producer. I bought the MDR-V600's for home use, and they look and sound new after 11 years of occasional use at home.These are an over-the-ear headphone, meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears, which means that your ears don't get sore. This also acoustically isolates you from your environment.  However, if you sweat heavily, they also tend to trap moisture.Sound reproduction is excellent and full-range, and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones, you will hear well and you won't hear much of what's going on around you outside the phones. They do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies, but that's something that most people don't mind.The screw-on 1/4\" tip screws off to reveal a 1/8\" stereo plug, so the phones work with most playback devices. I highly recommend them as durable, acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent, durable headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1243814400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2009"}
