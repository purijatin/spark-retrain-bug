The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the \"top 100\" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The software that it comes with is lackluster", "unixReviewTime": 1313193600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2011"}
