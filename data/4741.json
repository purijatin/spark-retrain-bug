We had good results using just earbuds and more advanced listening devices aren't necessary until you get to advanced levels of the program, but we decided we'd give them a try. They were also much cheaper from Amazon than buying from Centerpointe.They really have improved the listening experience. I have some slight hearing loss and these headphones allow me to hear a greater range of sound without having to turn the volume up too high. The headset is very lightweight and comfortable for the bulk of it. The cord is long and dangling and is really too much for an iPod (which of course they're not really made for anyway), but it's easy to reign in when necessary.If you get them, keep in mind that the bigger connector plug can be unscrewed to reveal the more common mini plug.Over all we give them two thumbs up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great enhanced listening", "unixReviewTime": 1221436800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2008"}
