There's always a tradeoff to be made in terms of what headphones have what strengths--but even at that, these headphones are pretty disappointing.These headphones have great depth (boomy) but in midranges they lack a lot of detail. The sound is full but very flat. Crispness is really lacking.  If you've heard some higher-end headphones, or are the sort of person that appreciates high-end satellites and tweeters when listening to a conventional speaker setup, you likely will be profoundly disappointed with these headphones.On the plus side, they are very comfortable to wear. They also do a very good job of sealing the sound in, so people nearby won't hear your music if you're wearing these. So they are a very good choice for work if you can put up with the sound quality.Worth serious consideration instead (for a closed/isolating headphone w/DJ functionality) would be the Sony MDR-V6--which are similar in construction but beat the V600 in every way, or the AKG K81DJ, which also produces far superior sound for the same money.  Those are not quite as comfortable as the Sony's--but sure sound better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Boomy and comfortable to wear, but detail is quite subpar", "unixReviewTime": 1150243200, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2006"}
