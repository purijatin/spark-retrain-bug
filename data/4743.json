I went through a number of headphones before getting this headphone. I have used KOSS headphones and Sennheisser headphones. The cheaper 30-40$ earphones I bought would always break down on me. Headband would snap or the quality was just getting very poor. I went to a local music store and decided to take a dive into more expensive headphones.I purchased these headphones without even listening to them. I asked the clerk to recommend a good affordable headphone and he handed me these. I bought them and had my mp3 player in hand to test these out. Immediately when I tried these headphones on it was a world of difference. They feel extremely comfortable and lightweight. The sound is real crisp and clean. These headphones sound beautiful with almost any sort of music. The only thing this headphone lack would be stronger bass. Everything else from mids to highs, it is very nice. I can wear these headphones for 6hrs straight before my ears start hurting. This headphone even comes with a cool leather carrying case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very nice quality headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1201305600, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2008"}
