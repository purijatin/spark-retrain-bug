Drake Dorosh", "helpful": [2, 6], "reviewtext": "I gave these headphones a five star rating because the sound is very clear.  You get good separation and a feeling of spatial separation and distance.  They work great. They are comfortable.  It's just too bad I can't use them.I bought these because other reviewers extolled the virtues of these headphones for sealing out the noise of their busy offices.  Any headphone can drown out surrounding noise.  Be warned.  These are not well sealed. The Sony product manual packed with the MDR-V600 headphones cautions customers not to disturb those close by.If you also got the impression that these \"closed\" headphones would allow you to listen privately you will be disappointed.  I work in an office doing data entry.  I like to listen to wild profane and controversial stuff and I don't want people listening in. These headphones would disturb my colleagues if I used them at work.  You can hear them clear and loud even when pressed firmly together.Nobody I work with wants to hear The Sex Pistols sing The Good Ship Venus.  So as good as the MDR-V600's are the little headphones that came with my player are better because I can crank them up and only I can hear them.  Too bad because these are so much more comfortable.Also I should mention I got \"refurbished\" MDR-V600 headphones.  The screws that hold them together do not all match some are silver and some are black.  Then it probably goes without saying that they are made in China not Japan.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not really private listening.", "unixReviewTime": 1143590400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2006"}
