I recently purchased a replacement pair, as my original set died after 6 years of intensive use. They were repeatedly abused, shoved in and out of my bag and under seats on airplanes and generally not treated very well. They have stood the test of time and really performed well.I am a designer and I wear headphones all day long at work so comfort is imperative. While these headphones are large, they are extremely comfortable and block out my obnoxious coworkers.While the earpads will wear away in time as they did with my old set, the comfort and quality is not compromised. I have purchased these as gifts for fellow music lovers and twice now for myself. I couldn't recommend them enough.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best", "unixReviewTime": 1096416000, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2004"}
