Buyer", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "In the last 15+ years, I tried a number of phone headsets by different manufacturers.  This one was the best --- lightweight, adjustable metal headband (not plastic), extremely comfortable, small unbreakable mic &#34;wand&#34;, easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control, and mic volume control, which is not common for headsets in this price range.
