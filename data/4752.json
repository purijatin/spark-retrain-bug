If you don't need background noise cancellation, and you prefer over-the-ear with boom microphone to stick-it-in-your-ear buds  :-)  then this is a very good, reliable bet.  A quick and easy mute switch / volume control is essential for conference calls, and this design is perfect for that.In November 2007 Amazon said this model was currently unavailable, so you might have to find the new model number.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good quality, reliable headset with easy mute switch", "unixReviewTime": 1195430400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2007"}
