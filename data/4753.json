It has volume & mute controls & I can wear it for long periods without any discomfort. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is, it just doesn't last long. I think it is in part that the cord gets yanked a bit here & there, catching on something as I move about, perhaps pulling connecting wires. I've tried other headsets that are not anywhere as good and don't last either. I just pay for this as I need it & accept it as the way it is.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great, when it works", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}
