I have Panasonic and have used Panasonic headsets previously. After I cycled through two of them, I decided to give this one a try. I just got it in the mail and it has 3.5 mm jack. My home phone takes 2.5mm jack. There is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so I relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone. I also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3.5 to 2.5 mm. I did not get that so this is useless for me.I will be contacting the vendor for a return. Disappointing!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Buyers Beware - It's 3.5 mm Jack (not 2.5 mm)", "unixReviewTime": 1332806400, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2012"}
