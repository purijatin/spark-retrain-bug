Elwood", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I have been using for daily for one week, with a 900MHz cordless home / office phone.  When my old headset died, I actually tried a cheap $20 brand-X replacement headset.....mistake.  Returned it, and decided to try the mythic Plantronics name.PRO:- Excellent sound quality sending and receiving- All day comfort in headset mode.  Have actually forgotten to remove it a couple times already.- Useful control features (mute, receiving volume, and sending output volume)- Good industrial design  (i.e. cool looking + mike boom is not too long)CON:- Concerns about durability.  The cable thickness and lack of robust strain relief looks like a potential for sudden failure.  Considering this the top of the line, I would have expected better from Plantronics.- Value (paid $45 locally).  Cost more than the phone itself.If it lasts awhile, I expect to be a happy customer.  For $30 on Amazon, I see little downside, and probably no better product for the intended use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great.....if it holds up", "unixReviewTime": 1166227200, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2006"}
