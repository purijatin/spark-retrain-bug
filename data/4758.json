After reading other reviews where people had stated that it only lasted 4-6 months before breaking I bought another one for back up. I have found it to be very comfortable and have used it several times for 1-2 hour conversations. I have put my phone in my shirt pocket and roamed the house while talking with no loss of clarity. I may have to buy another one as my wife is thinking of using the backup. I don't think the unit is that fragile, but some people are hard on things. I don't know if I would recommend it for continuous all day use, but if handled with reasonable care it seems it should last a lot longer then 6 months.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quite good for such a reasonable price", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014"}
