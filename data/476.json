It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reach out and Touch someone", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013"}
