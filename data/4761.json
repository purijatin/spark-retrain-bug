I bought this for my corded office phone, not a mobile or cordless phone, and it works great.  I really wanted a headset with the 2.5mm plug, and this is the ONLY one I have found which works well enough for me and has adjustable mic input.  Not sure about durability yet.  Quality seems okay, cord does seem somewhat thin.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice headset.", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013"}
