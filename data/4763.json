I'm happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call. I've used this model for over 8 years with a Radio Shack headset amplifier and the Nortel and Polycom phone systems. Love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for phone workers", "unixReviewTime": 1401580800, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2014"}
