Cloud", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "After trying dozens of headsets for my phone I was a little hesitant to try another one, but I've heard good things about the Plantronics brand so I thought I'd give this a try. Most of the headsets I've used suffered from poor reception or poor design (or both). I was both pleased and surprised that the M175C excels in looks and function. Calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind. The headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear. It comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head, which I did. The volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel. This works remarkably well and I find myself using it more than the volume control switch that's on my phone. Because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours I can hardly tell I have it on. It's so nice to finally be able to move around, make a cup of coffee, wave my hands in the air, or whatever.I highly recommend the M175C to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Look Ma!
