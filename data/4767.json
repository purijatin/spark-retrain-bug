I've used them for years and they wear out from use, which is to be expected. I hope they keep producing it. If the headband is too tight for you, just bend it a little. It also comes with an ear loop. Great incoming and outgoing volume controls.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Favorite Headset", "unixReviewTime": 1326758400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2012"}
