Nonetheless, I recommend it and would buy it again because it gives the best sound quality of the devices I've tried, it's very comfortable (I don't like ear pieces that hang onto my ear for support), and it has volume and mute controls at a decent price.  When you find a good price, I recommend buying several so you can keep one in each car, one by each indoor phone (I use it more for hands-free indoors than with my cell phone in the car), and because they will eventually break.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cell phone headset does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1242259200, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2009"}
