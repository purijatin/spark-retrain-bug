I've used this model and its siblings for 3 years and attest to the quality and value of Plantronics equiptment. I've bought three of their phones (2 as gifts) and have never  had a problem. When one of their products eventually wore down from high  use, they replaced it promptly with no hassle. They make most of the call  center equiptment in the world and it shows.This is a great product made  by a great company.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is it.", "unixReviewTime": 956793600, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2000"}
