I have tried over-the-ear and earbud hands-free units, but this is by far the most secure and comfortable hands-free style.  The volume control is easy to use and it has handy mute on/off switch.  No more finding the mute button and adjusting the volume on my Treo 650 anymore (pretty dangerous while driving).  My only complaint is the volume is a little low if you're talking to a soft-spoken person.  But it's tough anyway to listen to him/her without the headset, plus you can detach the cushion on the earpiece so the receiver is a little closer to your ear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is what I was looking for!", "unixReviewTime": 1122336000, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2005"}
