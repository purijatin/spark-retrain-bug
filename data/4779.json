I was able to purchase it from Amazon for only $25.00, and definitely got my money's worth.  I like this model because it has volume controls for both your voice output, and your hearing input.  I use it as a headset, and the only complaint I have is that the speaker has a lot of bass.  There are not any highs in the voice you hear, so your friend's voice always sounds emotionless and flat.  I guess it is this way to protect your hearing.  The sound is quite clear, just a limited frequency response.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Product", "unixReviewTime": 978912000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2001"}
