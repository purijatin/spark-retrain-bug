I've had no problems at all.  People can hear clearly on the other end, the Mute switch doesn't make any noise, volume control seems adequate.  It's been very durable too, I've dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected.  Most importantly, the sound reproduction quality is excellent.  Other headsets I've used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great for me", "unixReviewTime": 1036022400, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2002"}
