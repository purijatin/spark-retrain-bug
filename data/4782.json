I use it with my GE 5.8 GHZ cordless home phone and it works fine.  I work from home 2-3 days a week and attend or host conference calls about 2-4 times a day.  My coworkers tell me I sound loud and clear.  The set is comfortable; lightweight but not flimsy or fragile; with padded ear piece. I especially like the mute switch/volume control on the cord.  The cord is long enough to give me plenty of slack with the phone clipped to my waist band and I'm 6'3\" so that's important.  I would highly recommend this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headset; use for work from home.", "unixReviewTime": 1234742400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2009"}
