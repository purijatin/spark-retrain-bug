I have a Bluetooth headset on my left ear, and I keep this one on my right so I can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while I am working on my computer.  I use only Motorola cell phones and Bluetooth units, and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired.  The Plantronics unit is wondeful; it's light enough that I forget it's there, and even half-deaf me can hear it well.  The adjustable hearing is great, as is the adjustable volume on the microphone.  I heartily recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good headset!", "unixReviewTime": 1184284800, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2007"}
