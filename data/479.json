I have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch.  I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.  Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good unit terrible customer servi.3", "unixReviewTime": 1313539200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2011"}
