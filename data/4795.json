Also, having a mute switch on the cable control module is very useful.- Audio Quality: Incoming voices come in loud and clear and I've never had any complaints about my voice being unclear.- Comfort: I wear this for at least an hour at a time and have never felt uncomfortable wearing it. There is the usual adjustable headband, the microphone boom can be moved and the earpiece can be worn on either ear.Cons:- A version with two earpieces rather than just one would have been preferable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Suitable Cordless Phones", "unixReviewTime": 1296864000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2011"}
