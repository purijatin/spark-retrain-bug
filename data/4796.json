Nolan", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Expected more for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1332547200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2012"}
