Moessner \"Ray\"", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewtext": "I spent many hours searching for a good headset for my Clarity XLC 3.4 Cordless Phone for the hearing impaired and settled on this one as the most bang for the buck. I was hoping for a headset to improve my hearing even with this phone, which it did, but only marginally so. It is convenient not to hold the phone to speak into it. The best about this headset is its very low price of $17.48 through The OEM Shop. For that low price, what can one really expect. (I did note many similar offerings for this headset from other suppliers ranging to several times what I paid). At any rate, the image depicts two ear hooks; I received only one size which seems too large to be useful. I received with the package a short adapter cable to convert the headset's connector from 3.5 mm to the necessary 2.5mm for my phone.  The assembly is a bit clumsy when connected to my phone. The ear cushion is rather small (the image shows two). The entire headset construction is a bit fragile, and I don't expect it to last very long, so treat the unit with kid gloves. No instructions were supplied to convert to the ear hook, and I hesitate to try to adapt fearing to break the plastics.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Plantronics Mobile Convertible Headset M 175C", "unixReviewTime": 1311033600, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2011"}
