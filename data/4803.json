I have a Plantronics headset at work that is decent, so I bought this one.  It's even better than my headset at work!It is convertible from headset to earpiece (for those who like that sort of thing.  The little padded thingy for the earpiece (when used in headset configuration) is very comfortable.  I don't notice any discomfort even after 3-4 hours of usage.  There is a mute switch on the wire, and both the earpiece and microphone volumes are adjustable.I have only had mine for a month or so, so I can't comment on the durability issues yet.  Apparently, I'm not as acrobatic as some reviewers, so I don't expect problems.I really can't think of anything that I do not like about this piece of equipment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headset", "unixReviewTime": 1073001600, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2004"}
