Southern", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Headset for multiple uses", "unixReviewTime": 1267574400, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2010"}
