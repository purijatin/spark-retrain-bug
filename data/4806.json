Uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth.  Will keep trying to find a good &#34;plug-in&#34; headset for my iPhone as an alternate to bluetooth.  My biggest problem was that it wasn't clear from the description that I HAD TO ALSO ORDER the 2.5 - 3.5 adapter in order for the plug to work with my iPhone 4.  Went all over trying to find such an item to no avail (even Best Buy didn't carry anything).  Trying to return it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't bother", "unixReviewTime": 1397952000, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2014"}
