I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "static, poor sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1334534400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2012"}
