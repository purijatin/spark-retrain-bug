All of the features work flawlessly. People are very satisfied when I am on them, there is no strange sound to my calls. It comes with the short cable I need to use with my Panasonic handsets. It is light weight and having the controls on the line make it perfect for my use. If I needed another set for another location in my home, I would buy the same product again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones, very satisfied.", "unixReviewTime": 1378857600, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2013"}
