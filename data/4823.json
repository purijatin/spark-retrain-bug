These are GREAT headphones! They produce quality sound, provide great comfort (even for giant Dumbo ears like mine), and they're super sturdy. There are my first pair of headphones of this quality so I don't really have anything to compare to other than Beats ear buds, but these are two very different products. In all, these outperform the Beats earbuds in every aspect except for portability, comfort, and sound cancelling ability.These headphones will take some time to get use to if you're not used to wearing bulky headphones; they weight about a pound or so. With the weight, the band tends to sit on the top of head, regardless of how I adjust it, and it caused a little pain initially but it's no longer a problem because I've gotten used to it. The headphones are completely over the ears, so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well; I've also gotten used to this. One other problem is the adapter, the 3.5mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like 2-2.5\" so it's nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline (ie: on a laptop chill pad, or even watching it on your lap).Even with this all said it's still the best pair of headphones I've owned and it seems like it'll continue providing quality sound for many years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1350777600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2012"}
