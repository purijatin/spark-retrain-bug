Like everyone says, they don't color the sound which is important when monitoring the sound from the camera. You don't want any unnatural enhancement that isn't really there. About the tightness, for me they are perfect.  They are not tight at all. I have an average size head for a 6'1&#34; 250lb guy. The cord is long too and it has a tight spring to it so that if you walk away from the camera forgetting that these are on your head you wont pull the camera off the tripod.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1369958400, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2013"}
