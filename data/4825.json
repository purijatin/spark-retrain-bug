Buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about. It picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from Tupac's song (Who do u believe in) i've never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had, even from the KOSS portapro, which are also freakin amazing. The bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because they're not intented to be that way. So in conclusion, these head phones, to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording, which is why i bought them. So =DOh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my Macbook pro, a little staticy sound, very very faint, is noticeable when u move the jack.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It picks up things i've never heard before!!
