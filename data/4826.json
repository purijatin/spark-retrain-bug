Croft", "helpful": [1, 4], "reviewtext": "After not many hours of use, the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate. The synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part. It looked like I probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip, although it would have taken some time. But because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. What a waste. Overall, a very poor design in my view.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poorly designed ear pads", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}
