These are also the most expensive headphones I ever purchased. So, I can't really compare them to more expensive brands.I find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones I have owned.The only problem I had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about 1/2hr to and hour.- To fix this I just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headband.It looks ridiculous but works great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I have ever owned (at this price range)", "unixReviewTime": 1385164800, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2013"}
