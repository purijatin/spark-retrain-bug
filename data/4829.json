I use them for my desktop and the long cord let me move free. I recomend these a lot. ps: they get a little warm on your ears.Update: After using them for one year, I have to say that all my other headphones sucks :P . The sound of these V6 are way wayyyyy better than any other I ever had. Watching movies with dts and my V6 it's just awsome. I'm very glad I got them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "love them", "unixReviewTime": 1355356800, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2012"}
