I used it from time to time - much less lately.  At the very beginning, I first ran it for at least a hundred hours - leaving it plug to a CD player or PC and keep playing a few different kinds of music.  I found the headphone reproducing high frequencies and low frequencies quite good.  However, it lacks mid-ranging; resulting that the music reproduced felt a bit &#34;thin&#34; and not warm enough (but not harsh).  I mostly listen to classical music, easy listening, Jazzy, vocal, instrumental, etc., but no hard rock.Also, it's not comfortable for wearing long times -- more than 30 mins -- you'll feel too warm to your ears; also the headphone is a bit heavy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Mid-range lacking; not comfortable for long time wearing.", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}
