Green \"Child of Good\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewtext": "As the title of my review implies, I am a former \"Koss-Lover\"...was not necessarily a \"Sony-Hater\" since I've been buying their earbuds for years... However, although I've heard Sony headphones previously, purchasing the V6 was still a chore since I had never actually bought a pair...preferring the Koss TD-80s and TD-65s over the Sony offerings... However, Koos has ceased those models and have adopted lesser engineering. Thus, Sony was a breath of fresh air.I've allowed these headphones to fully break in before using them for any recordings... I recorded with them yesterday. Damn! Wow... Damn and Wow again. The quality of the sound--the true full range of the sound--was stunning...almost made me forget what I was recording. Excellent pair of headphones! At this point, I want to purchase another pair, but I'll wait until I have a surplus of funds since it seems the price keeps going up on them...If you're \"on the fence\"...stop playing...get these!!If you're not using these for recording, or not going to use these on a more amplified source (Such as a home receiver or headphone amplifier of some sort) don't fret... I've listened to these on my T-Mobile MyTouch with sufficient sound and quality sound reproduction...So, I'm sure your IPod will do fine. :-)Enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Former Koss-Lover", "unixReviewTime": 1286668800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2010"}
