Malik \"Jet\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought these after a lot of research and I am glad that I did, one of my co-workers actually got the more expensive MDR 7506 and we ended up doing a side by side sound test.  We played some FLAC files through VLC using the Focusrite USB 2i2 DAC and though they both sound good on their own, you can clearly tell that the 7506 is coloring the sound significantly.  Also, the bass response on these seems to be better as well.Some people have complained about the comfort of these and I have worn them for hours on end while working and have found them to be incredibly comfortable.  I might enjoy the new ear pads because they supposedly help improve the sound quality, if/when I do I will update this to see if the combination is worth the hassle/money.All in all amazing headphones especially considering the price, you cannot go wrong with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}
