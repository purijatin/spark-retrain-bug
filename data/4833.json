He suggested I get these for him so that he can listen and I can sleep in peace. I think I love them more than he does! He used to use just ear buds and I could hear what he was listening to plain as day. I can't hear anything when he is using these headphones. He says that the sound with these are fantastic, like you're in a home theater. We both think they are worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The sound is great, and others can't hear anything", "unixReviewTime": 1392681600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014"}
