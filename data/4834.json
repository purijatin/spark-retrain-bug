Being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody else's dime, I settled down to research. After hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores, I finally settled on the Sony MDR-V6, having been warned away from the newer Sony model that was supposed to replace them. Obviously the ear cups haven't died yet, but I know they will in a few years, and I don't mind at all.I just got them in earlier this afternoon, and I haven't taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary. I've been listening to music for hours now. The biggest fear I had with buying new headphones was that they wouldn't be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance. After about an hour of listening to Emilie Autumn's electric violin, which has both in abundance, I have to say that my fears were laid to rest. I then moved on to the rest of my music library, and so far - with only a few hours of breaking-in - it all sounds amazing. Metal, rock, classical, reggaeton, electric, jazz, trance, everything. There's a touch of bass that I can't usually hear, and I'm not sure if that's enhancement from the phones or just because I can actually hear better now, but I like it.All in all, one of the best not-a-textbooks I've ever bought, and I see myself loving these way after this class is over.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than a textbook, for sure!", "unixReviewTime": 1265328000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2010"}
