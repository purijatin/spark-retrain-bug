I bought the best ones I could find for my Droid 2, and they seemed ok, for awhile.  Then I purchased the FIIO D11 and paired it with these headphones. What can I say...it's awesome.  The FIIO on low gain, with EQ set to zero, my droid volume as loud as it would go, makes these headphones loud. Really loud. At high gain, they're too loud. But even then, there's no distortion. None. The sound is crisp and clear.  Drums sound like you're standing in front of the drummer. It's like you're on stage. Just like the other reviews say, you can hear things in the music that you don't even notice using the headphones mortals use.It comes with a nice carrying bag. The bag has a drawstring. It's a nice, leather or faux leather bag, but with the drawstring I can't put the extras in without worrying about them falling out in the wrong place. But I didn't expect the bag, so who cares? The phones fold up easily, and quickly, and won't take up much carry-on space.These phones are really comfortable. I was worried that they would sit ON my ears, but my ears fit nicely inside the cups. And it's easy to adjust them for a perfect fit.I have a trip coming up in a few weeks, and I'm looking forward to putting these on and rediscovering my music collection. I wish I was leaving right now!I highly recommend you get both items in this review, if you have a droid and want quality sound.  Without the FIIO, these phones are probably loud enough for most people. Even on an airplane. They sound as loud to me as my tinny headphones did, but without sounding crappy. Like I'm sitting in my living room listening to a quality stereo.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These phones are AWESOME", "unixReviewTime": 1312848000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2011"}
