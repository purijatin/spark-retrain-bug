They still look almost new and still sound exceptional. More recently I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD590 phones thinking that perhaps I would get even better quality sound. Indeed, the 590's sound very good but frankly, though they sound slightly different than the v6's, I don't think they sound any better.The v6's have a presence and clarity which is very compelling. They can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlessly.The mid-tones are clear and mellow. Distortion is inaudible. If you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money I recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding, very high quality sound", "unixReviewTime": 1289606400, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2010"}
