I wanted something comfortable, durable, with a long cord.  These fit the bill perfectly.  They are well built, fold easily, and fit in a durable bag easily.  The sound quality is excellent.  I've heard static a couple of times when shifting the guitar, but that's not the fault of the headphones.  I have a medium sized head, and they fit me snugly but comfortably.  I can get a bit of nausea when using them, but not nearly as bad as some other headphones I've tried.I'm very satisfied with these headphones, they are well worth the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1219881600, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2008"}
