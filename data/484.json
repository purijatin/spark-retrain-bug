It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1355788800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2012"}
