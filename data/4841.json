I use them daily for long periods of listening and then I'll leave them for a while and go to the stuido speakers.  They still look like the same model they sell now. They are extremely accurate.  Will rip up a bad recording and make a good one sound everything it should.  The ear pads are vinyl, but under that on my was a terry cloth so I peeled the vinyl away about 15 years ago and they are more comfortable.  I haven't heard any phones that sound any better than this in my looking around.  If they give out after 20 or 30 years I'll get another pair in a heartbeat.  But this pair are like old blue jeans to me.  You won't be disappointed with this.  I think you would have to shop long and hard and spend lots more to get this quality in any other model or make.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best things I have.", "unixReviewTime": 1203033600, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2008"}
