The sound quality is good--everything comes through clearly and cleanly.  Unfortunately, I'm running into the same problem a number of other people here have mentioned.  Static from the plug end.  I'm not sure if it's the plug itself or the wire but the slightest movement can cause static and even cause one of the speakers to cut out.  It's bad enough that my android devices think I've disconnected the headphones and helpfully pause the music.  I returned the first pair but the second pair had the exact same problem.  I've tried them on multiple devices--phone, tablet, PC, even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with.  Same problem everywhere.  I'm not sure what happened at Sony but I'd advise staying away from these headphones until they fix the issue.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Static problems at plug", "unixReviewTime": 1357430400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2013"}
