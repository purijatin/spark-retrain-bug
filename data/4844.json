My $25 Panasonics were great for the price, and gave excellent service until the inline volume knob started having a flaky connection.After reading the reviews on this item, I went ahead and bought a pair, and I am blown away by the difference in quality that extra $50 buys. The Sonys feel very well made, and they use metal and high quality plastics that make the headphones feel sturdy. I have no doubt these will last as long as the other reviewers are claiming.As for the sound quality, these are phenomenal. I am sure headphone purists will point out that their $700 Grado pair blows these away, but I haven't heard anything in this price range that even comes close.I play my bass guitar through my mixing board, and it is a 5-string model with the low string tuned to a low B. My old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when I played full volume on the low end of the B string, and I thought I was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board, but after plugging in the Sonys, I discovered it was actually the headphones. The Sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bass.My only complaint is it takes about 75% volume on an iPod to get a reasonable listening volume, compared to about 55% on my old headphones. However, if you plug them into an amplified source (such as a mixing board, headphone amplifier, home stereo receiver, etc) you should have no trouble getting good volume.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the price", "unixReviewTime": 1159833600, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2006"}
