While it's unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile, it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music well.The pads are extremely comfortable. (However, continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years; Beyer makes fine replacement pads.) As you'd expect from closed headphones, the sound is a little \"closed-in\" -- but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk. These are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic range.The V6 doesn't try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio; rather, it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own.-- It's reasonably priced-- They play many types of music-- They're easily driven by iPods or CD players-- The V6 is (aside from the pads) an amazingly sturdy performerIf you're picky...-- The sound is \"colored\" (that is, not completely accurate)-- They have a closed-in sound -- a result of their being closed phonesI've since graduated to the Beyer DT880s, a notably better phone. But the V6 has legions of fans, for obvious reasons. Even people who hate Sony headphones concede the V6's attractive sound. They've served me well for over a decade.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A classic that's easy to find", "unixReviewTime": 1111363200, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2005"}
