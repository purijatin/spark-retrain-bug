This new pair is once again a superbly made and designed high fidelity gift to anyone wanting really superb sound.Simply plugging them into a good receiver pumping out DVD sound, and you are instantly into the world of outstanding sound from the DVD and isolated from the sounds in your environment.  The bass, mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced and extend across a wider range than my large Boston Acoutic 150 speakers. After suffering with the sporadic connection failures and static in the individual plugs on the earpieces of a $300 Sennheiser earphone set (now gone into the trash) I'm happily back with Sony's V6 technology.The sound is better than the Sennheisers when they were new. The bass in the Sony's is spectacular and clean for any price range headphones.If these wear out before I do, I'll get another set of the same ones.  As long as Sony keeps making the MDR-V6, I'll keep buying them.The listing fails to mention that a very nice leatherette drawstring carrying caseis included to hold the phones and spiral wound cord when folded, just like the one that came with my first set many years ago.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the best buy.
