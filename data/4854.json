The sound isolation is good and the headphones bring new life into your existing music collection. You'll hear sounds you've never heard before.I also have the Grado SR60, and those are very good open-ear phones. These are just as good in terms of sound quality. They are also a significant step up from my previous SONY MDR-V600 (which I didn't like and the foam deteriorated quickly).I highly recommend it. As usual, Amazon delivery was quick and arrived before my trip.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent!", "unixReviewTime": 1260057600, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2009"}
