So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly \"bother\" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can't imagine headphones getting that much better. i've heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "not so bad, just the best i ever had", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}
