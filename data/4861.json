I'm no super audiophile, but I have a decent surround sound system, appreciate good sound and deep bass. I love hearing fine details in well-recorded and mastered music like a guitar strum. And I swear $40 in-ear phones of just about any random brand have better richer sound than these. I tried them in my surround system, tried them in my iPhone, iPad, iMac, PC, and everywhere it sounded like I had two under-powered, muddy tin cans.I guess I must be crazy, because everyone else seems to love these. I returned and got cheaper in-ear phones, because the sound is much much better.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "highly overrated", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2014"}
