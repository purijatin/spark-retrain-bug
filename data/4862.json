They have fantastic sound. And for the price (almost always less than a hundred bucks, sometimes much less) even if they do fail or wear out (which they almost never do), they're easily replaced.I can't handle in-ear buds -- my canals are too small and they always hurt. On-ear headphones are a joke. These are perfection. That one small adjustment I mentioned? Get a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 250 velour replacement pads and suddenly these headphones become the last pair you'll ever need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I have owned one or more pairs of these since the late 1980s", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"}
