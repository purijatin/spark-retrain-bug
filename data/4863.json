I received a pair of these phones in 1991 (maybe 1990, not sure), as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle.  Since receiving them, I have taken them with me all over the world.  I've slept with them on my head on 15 hour flights, I have slept with them in my bed, they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage.Not only do these things sound incredible, they obviously hold up VERY well considering the abuse I have heaped upon mine and they are STILL working and sounding perfectly after these EIGHTEEN (18) years.  I am in awe of their...awesomeness.I have replaced the ear pads once, with these Beyer Dynamic velour pads (highly recommended btw):  [...]I'm 36 years old, and wondering if I will be willing these things to one of my children?!  :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easiest 5 star review I have given", "unixReviewTime": 1248912000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2009"}
