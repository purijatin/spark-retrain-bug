The sound quality is nothing less than awesome, from deep, well-defined bass to clear mid-range (Sade, Billy Joel and Etta James just sound divine!) to sharp (but not overbearing) highs.  The dynamic range is astounding...you'll hear little details in songs you never noticed before.I'm sure you could find better headphones, for a lot more money. But unless you have the hearing of a dog, you're not going to notice enough of a difference to make the extra hundred dollars or so worth your while.  If you're willing to spend some dough, but not wanting to pay a mint, these are highly recommended.My only caveat is that the fit is a little snug.  In a way it's good, because it helps keep background noise out without the distortion that noise cancellation can introduce.  These are ideal for noisy environments where you want to be alone with your sound.  But I could see where individuals with wider than average heads might experience a bit of discomfort with prolonged use.  If I take my glasses off while wearing these headphones, I generally have to take the headphones off to put my glasses back on.  But then again, eyeglasses and headphones are always an awkward mix.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Own Little World of Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1364515200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013"}
