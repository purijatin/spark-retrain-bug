If these disappeared, I would buy a replacement set immediately.The build quality is top notch, much better than you'd expect from the photo.  Other headphones have chinsy hinges, or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well, but when you feel these in your hands, you will know that they will last.  The cord and plug are both pro grade also.The audio quality is great.  Are there better sounding phones?  maybe.  I've had some very expensive Sennheisers, Sonys, a few random off brands and a pair of Grados, all which sounded great.  These Sony's hang with them.  If you can find a pair that sounds better, that pair will be $500, and it won't blow these Sony's out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details.Comfort is good.  The foam goes fully around your ear(circumaural) and they are a closed can design so they &#34;block out&#34; outside sounds.  They aren't &#34;noise isolating&#34; or &#34;noise reducing&#34;, but they block enough to put you in your own audio space.  If you listen with these, you won't hear the phone ringing in the other room.  If you have sweaty ear syndrome or don't like headphones that are closed, these might not be up your alley.  That is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones.  I personally really like the closed, circumaural design.  The band and the ear pressure are exactly right.  In ten years, after you've worn through the ear pads, replacements will still be readily available online.Overall, these are the industry standard for a reason.  Time tested, excellent quality, unbeatable value.  Buy these headphones, you will be satisfied with them for sure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are the headphones that you need", "unixReviewTime": 1364774400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2013"}
