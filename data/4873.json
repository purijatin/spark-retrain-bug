Now that I have the new pair I can definitely say that over the years, the old ones lost a lot of bass even though I've replaced the ear pads, and the new pair sounds like I remember the old ones sounding when they were new. All the bass is there, all the highs and definitely all the midrange. The musical detail is extraordinary. I count on these headphones to hear things up close and personal when I'm doing productions and have never found a pair that sounded anywhere near what I get from these. Glad I was still able to get a pair of these V6's. They're #1 in my book!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "#1 In My Book!", "unixReviewTime": 1392336000, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2014"}
