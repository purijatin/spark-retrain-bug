If you want big booming bass, pick up a set of V-Moda Crossfades.  If you want to hear subtle nuances in your music which you never new were there before, then these are the phones for you.  Very light and incredibly comfortable to boot.  Quite honestly, I can't imagine how someone could complain that these give a tight fit.  I generally use these with my Nuforce Icon DAC, Google Play Music, and my Toshiba Chromebook.  However, I think they shine the best when using the DAC along with my Onkyo C7030.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They Certainly Pass the \"I never heard that before\" Test!", "unixReviewTime": 1393459200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2014"}
