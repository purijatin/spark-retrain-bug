It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.After retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seems good on every aspect", "unixReviewTime": 1311724800, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2011"}
