I used 7506s for my video shoots for many years. They are wonderful. These V6s are every bit as great. Light comfy, straight excellent sound. If you're gonna get a cramp because it doesnt have a red Pro sticker on the side, get 7506s. If you want equally great headphones at steal of a price buy the V6s here, you'll be very happy.Get these phones, and live happily ever after.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "V6 vs the Porfessional 7506", "unixReviewTime": 1258156800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2009"}
