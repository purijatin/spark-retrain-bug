They are a very faithful reproducer of audio, so you're hearing what the people who made your music or moves want you to hear - not what the people who made your headphones want you to hear. I love that I can listen to dance, orchestral, rock, rap, or basically any style of music with these. The other neat thing about these headphones is that they're standard equipment at nearly every studio ever. So you're more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music used.The simple fact is that these headphones blow $200 beats and other 'designer' headphones out of the water. They just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bass.One drawback, which might just be a personal thing: they're too narrow for my head. I could just have a wide head, but I feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head. I realize that this is partly necessary for good sound (keeps the earcups seated on your ears) but I feel like it could be toned down a bit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic sound, these are the industry standard for a reason.", "unixReviewTime": 1349049600, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2012"}
