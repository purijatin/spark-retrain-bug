Build quality is very good.  Sounds amazing (my first pair of real cans).  My parents had just bought 2 pairs of Bose OE2's for $99, and both agreed that my cheaper V6's sound better! My only complaint is that the bass runs a bit thin for my tastes...but it is actually pretty accurate. These are not the bass-heavy Beats that sound best with rap music and not much else; the V6's sound amazing with everything from Classical to Rock to R&B; to Soul to Primus.My iPhone 4S drives them good enough to not &#34;need&#34; a headphone amplifier (but of course I still &#34;want&#34; one, LOL).  Be forewarned though; these cans reproduce the sound SO ACCURATELY that now, poorly-compressed MP3s now annoy the heck out of me.  I can even hear the difference between my 128kbps AAC's and my lossless ALAC files.  I finally had an excuse to re-rip a bunch of CDs into 256kbps AAC and/or ALAC now.Very comfortable, even for hours at a time.  I want to try the velvet ear pads just to see how they are, but the stock ones are still very comfortable.If you're on the fence, and you don't need a huge bottom end, these won't disappoint you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a knock-off", "unixReviewTime": 1354579200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2012"}
