First of all they aren't tight, at least on my head, so they rest comfortably. Second the sound quality is AMAZING! no wonder they've had these cans selling for decades! if you have an eq on your pc, then you can raise the bass a little if you're feeling frisky (lol). I use them for some mxing and casual listening and they're great so far! Anyway with that said these headphones are great and at $50 (when i bought it) they rival a lot foof the higher end headphone! Definitely in my recommendation for a good set of headphones!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SOLID", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}
