They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.Buy them. You wont be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Five Star Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1202428800, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2008"}
