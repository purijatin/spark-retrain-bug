These headphones have been used along with my Sony Diskman, iPods (gen 1, 3 and 6), home stereo and gaming pc's since I got them. It has outlived most of the tech I had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them. Bought a replacement pair in 2009 on Amazon and just got around to reviewing them.These headphones sound great when I first bought them and still do now. They opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones don't pick up.I have taken these with me while riding the bus, long car trips and on the airplane. They can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag. So they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in. They are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time. Even taken long naps and slept with them over night. They do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones. They are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a vice.Only problem I ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while. But you can get replacement pads that don't flake. But I cant knock the rating down for that since I had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back in.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best bang for my buck", "unixReviewTime": 1402444800, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2014"}
