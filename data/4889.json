I've owned mine since the late 80s and have two pair: one for home and one for work.  I've replaced the earpads about every 8 years.These are quite simply one of the best ten products I've ever owned.  The sound quality is unparalleled.  They are efficient enough to be driven loud from a computer or an ipod.  I have a super large head and these are very comfortable.  Those of you complaining they are too tight don't understand how to adjust them - pull the earpieces down if they are too tight.I've never found a better pair at any price.  The fact that these are under $100, last essentially forever, and sound superb, is a modern miracle.Flat frequency response as high as any human ear can hear and lower than most any equipment can produce, and yet the sound is pleasing from just about any source.Buy a pair of them without hesitation.  You'll never regret it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Probably one of the best purchases I've ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1310601600, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2011"}
