I also have sennheisers at the same price and I felt Sony this was better than those head headphones. They are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem. They look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I would recommend these headphones..", "unixReviewTime": 1356393600, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2012"}
