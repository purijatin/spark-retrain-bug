It may be 10 feet long but because it's coiled you really are limited to where you can go.  Go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo.  Just need to limit your range.  No biggie.  I just move the chair closer to the stereo.Also, the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noises.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good choice.", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012"}
