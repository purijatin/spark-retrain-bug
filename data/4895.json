As other reviewers have noted, it is very heavy due to its substantial coiling -- and as a result it will not comfortably rest on any surface yet cannot be left dangling because it is too heavy! Maybe an example would suffice... if I plug these into my Mac Tower while sitting at my desk, the cord is too short to not start engaging the coils -- which produces tension and then tugs on the headphones -- eventually causing the plug to pop out of the computer. ANNOYING. What's worse is that the cord refuses to rest on he desk either without sliding off because (once again) it is too short and the coils are too heavy. I have to secure it down which is harder than it might seem without duct tape, plus it really restricts my movement.For this alone, I would recommend another set.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Major issues with the cord.", "unixReviewTime": 1229731200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2008"}
