At this price, the sound quality is wonderful. I did burn-in with an app on android, using pink noise. Before the burn-in, the sound is good but not smooth enough. Now it just sounds right. The sound is much smoother. Good build quality. Nicely packaged. A decent leather bag is included.Now the CONS or insufficiency:1. don't expect light weight but it is ok;2. cable is \"telephone wire\", maybe good for moving around in studio, but ugly and unnecessary for other use;3. the can doesn't hug your head tightly. It is comfy for home use but you probably can't go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail.Overall, a great quality headphone for the price. Try it with flac/ape against other can, you will feel the great sound quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Great Headphone for Home/Studio use, Not for commuting", "unixReviewTime": 1339545600, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2012"}
