We had a baby on the way and I anticipated lots of reading time. They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great. The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly. I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good. I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?) but I can go weeks without charging. I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the \"n\" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations. The Simple Touch with GlowLight wasn't an option when I bought mine.Overall it's a great, versatile, light small e-reader.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love my Nook Simple Touch", "unixReviewTime": 1337212800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2012"}
