The sound these produce completely removed the need to use any EQ settings on my IPod.I mostly listen to Pop, Rock, and Rap so I can say Highs are great, Mids are good, bass is excellent and clear,and no noise distortion.I can't speak to how well the build of the Headphones will last overtime, but so far they seem durable.They are a good choice if you plan on owning a HIGH QUALITY or audiophile version of headphones.The only thing I absolutely HATE is the LONGGGGGGG CABLE. I can't work it with it, it dangles over my legs,jumps up and down with me. If Sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy, Beats, Souls, Audio Technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "They sound great and produce accurate sounds", "unixReviewTime": 1356307200, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2012"}
