I have used the 7506 headphones for probably 20 some years now, replacing them when the earcups started to break down(this is my third set). I listen every day to speakers and headphones. I now have both models and can compare them. In my opinion(and please no hate mail) I think the 7506's sound better. They are slightly clearer and produce more air if you know what I mean. Bass is good on both but once again i think it is slightly cleaner with the pro phones. One writer mentioned about the gold plating wearing off of the connector. I plug my phones in and out all the time (for years) and the connector still looks perfect. No wear at all!!. maybe that coonector has something to do with the sound difference. I dont know but if i had to do it all over again I would spend the extra money and buy the MDR 7506. Dont get me worng. the v6 is a good phone but for my ears the other set is the way to go.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "THEY ARE A GOOD HEADPHONE", "unixReviewTime": 1319587200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2011"}
