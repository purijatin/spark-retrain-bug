I've always been content spending a little extra money for quality and peace of mind; these headphones are one of the rare occurrences when you can get an incredible product at an extremely reasonable price. Lightweight, comfortable and sturdily built headphones with an incredibly balanced sound. Bass is very accurate and complements vocals and instruments nicely. Find myself wearing these for hours on end with no irritation, although clearly head and ear shape vary greatly, the MDR-V6 will be a steady companion of mine for the foreseeable future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rich, warm, full headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1329782400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012"}
