Right away I was astonished by the vast details, crisp vocals and all the little details that was intended to be heard by the artist!For under $100, this is one of the best in that price range, it even sounds better than some higher priced headphones!This definitely sounds better than my Beats, and Bose headphones!These headphones are also very comfortable, feels much more durable than Beats and Bose.Based on other reviews, it seems that these headphones will last a long time!Buy it, don't hesitate, you won't regret it! :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"}
