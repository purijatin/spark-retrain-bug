My go-to system begins with a Sennheiser MKH416-T short shotgun mic into a Sound Devices 302 mixer (which can power the T-power mic), the line-in into a JuicedLink RM222 then into a Nikon D800, then recording to the HDMI output to an Atomos Ninja.To monitor, I plug my trusty MDRV6's into the monitor out of the 302 mixer, which is listening via its return to the headphone output of the Nikon. With a knob turn, I can then listen to any of the mixer's three inputs directly or to the camera's return confidence feed.If it sounds good in the Sony MDRV6's, it'll sound good in the edit.Yes, there are way more expensive headphones, but I know how the MDRV6's sound, I trust them, and they never break.The biggest problem is coworkers &#34;borrowing&#34; them and not returning them.
