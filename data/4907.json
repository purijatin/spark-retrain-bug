Unfortunately, the soft earcups are very susceptible to any little noise source, including movement of eyeglass frames and touching/scratching your cheek. I really wish that stores would have headphones on display so that you could find things like this out at the store. I also think that the earcups will get hot and sweaty with extended use. So far the Bose TriPorts are the only units that I have found that are comfortable and don't create this noise from rubbing, but I don't particularly like their sound, plus they cost twice what these do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Sound, Comfortable, but Beware Eyeglasses Wearers!", "unixReviewTime": 1185926400, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2007"}
