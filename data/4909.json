They sound great for all kinds of music as well as for monitoring audio during video editing.  Probably not suited for audio mixing as these phones are made for great sound, not the sort of flat response you'd probably want for mixing.These phones sit on top of my ears, and as other reviewers have noted, they can get a bit warm and little too snug after a couple hours of wearing them.  However, I don't wear them too long in any one sitting, so it doesn't bother me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound!  Pretty good comfort.", "unixReviewTime": 1380326400, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2013"}
