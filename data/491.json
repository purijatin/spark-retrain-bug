Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice - Especially when rooted with Touch Nooter", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2012"}
