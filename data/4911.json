Have you searched the net and Head-Fi looking for advice? Look no further. If you want open headphones, choose the Sennheiser PX100 or Grado SR60 or SR80. IF you want closed, there is no better choice under $150 than the MDR-V6. Beware the other Sony models - they have a few good ones, but most are not so good, even a few that are pricier than this one. This is the same headphone (except for cosmetics) as the MDR-7506-great sound-easy to drive with or without an amp-durable-comfortableDo not hesitate - you won't regret these!Update 6/2010:These are still great, but Shure has since introduced two models (the SRH-440 and 840) that are very nice and worth a listen, some will certainly prefer them to the Sony. The 440 is very close in price as well. Also worth considering is the Denon AH-D1000 and D-1001, which when on sale are around $100. The Denons have great sound, perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the Sony, but the Denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $500. The Sony wins on ruggedness and value, though, and the sound isn't worlds apart...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome!
