The Sennheiser HD 280 pro, are a heftier, build, have a flatter response, and all parts are replaceable, but it's good to have more than one tool in this area. This being my second pair of Sony MDR-V6, my son destroyed my original pair in an electronic music class, after he \"borrowed\" them, I found sonically, I was missing something by just using the Sennhiesers. The Sony's have deeper bass and an extended high end, which makes them more \"musical\". The quality for the price can not be beat. In fact for listening to music, I would recommend these, over any other headphone under $100.00. You have to trust so many positive reviews, these are classics!Addendum 12/4/2011I added the Beyer Dynamic Padded ear cushions, and these headphones are a lot more comfortable. I noticed immediately, that the bass response went way up, maybe not such a good thing for critical monitoring and mixing. I'm just wondering why? I did notice when I took the original Sony pads off, there is an additional layer, albeit thin, of foam, behind the velour. Perhaps this is why. Also as often discussed, headphones get a sweeter sound after about a 60 to 90 hour \"break in\" period. The Sony's definitely get smoother with age.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Classic", "unixReviewTime": 1321660800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2011"}
