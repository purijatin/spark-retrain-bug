The bass is true, the mid-range is strong, and the treble is clear. The supplied 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater set-up. These headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the sound.The stock earpads are okay. I bought the Beyerdynamic Pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones. Plus, they add a bit more bass, which is great.These cans have the reputation of being extremely tough. I can't really say much about that, since I've owned them for a couple of months barely. But I'm hoping to get some years from these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 1257638400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2009"}
