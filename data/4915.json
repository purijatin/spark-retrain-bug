I lay no claim to having an educated ear, but I have anyone's subjective ability to distinguish better sound quality from not so good sound quality. These headphones are definitely in the \"better\" category.I bought these 'phones to wear during keyboard practice so I wouldn't annoy others in the room. I quickly found they were so good that I started plugging them into the laptop when I wanted to watch a flick or listen to something on line. I imagine they will replace every other pair or headphones or earbuds in the house.I don't have comfort issues with them, but am sometimes annoyed at their tendency to fold up when I take them off for a moment. I'd rather fold my own headphones, thank you, not have a spring system do it for me.Old guy alert: I'm closer to 70 than 60, and I have the usual age-related high-end hearing deficiency. In the real world I can barely hear the top two or three notes on a piano. Through these headphones the tones are still faint, but clearer. I take that to mean that the over-ear pads are screening out some of the aural clutter that will bury all but the loudest high tones for me.All in all, very satisfied.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent 'phones", "unixReviewTime": 1338768000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2012"}
