It's been years since I've had over-the-ear headphones and there's no comparison in both comfort and sound vs earbuds. These are like being in concert. The MDR-V6's have a nice, neutral sound, meaning they're not overly base heavy but more realistic to what natural sound would be. The cord is coiled and doesn't detach from the headset. So for those who want everything to come apart these wouldn't do it. I use them primarily to listen to music when I'm using my computer and sometimes when I'm playing something I haven't heard in a while, like YES, I just have to stop and appreciate the music again. Wonderful experience.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Really nice sound", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}
