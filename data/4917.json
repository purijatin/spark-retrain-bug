I did try them with several different sources. I listen to pretty much everything  classic, counrty, folk, rock, you name it( not much on rap or techno ). Compared to my Harmon Kardon and Pioneer speakers  or even cheap Skull Candy earbuds these headphones just didn't cut it for bass.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Headphones but Lacking in Deep Bass", "unixReviewTime": 1370304000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2013"}
