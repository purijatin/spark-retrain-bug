I was pretty disappointed when I plugged them in for the first time.  I got a second opinion from my brother, and he didn't have anything nice to say about them either.They have a particular warm sound that some people may appreciate, but it's like have a built-in EQ on the headphones that you can never change.  I personally like flat-sounding speakers (e.g. B&W;, and I like Denon receivers for this reason) and in this category the V6s don't perform well at all.Another problem: I am picky about comfort.  These headphones were not comfortable for me at all.  I could wear them for about 1 hour before I absolutely had to take them off.I am picky about my headphones, so I gave these to my friend and I'm still on the prowl for a better set.  I have since listened to the V600s, and I prefer the V600s to these (although I'm still not sure if I will settle on the V600s).One more thought: and anybody saying that these have no bass is out of their mind!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Disappointed...", "unixReviewTime": 1154649600, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2006"}
