I tried the JVC Black Series and a couple of Bose and none of them sounded like what I was looking for, not that they where bad, just not what I was looking for. These sound exactly like what I had in mind, the sound is very clear and crisp, I'm hearing parts of my music that I never even knew where there. I listen to a Lot of different Genres; Rap, R&B, Rock, and Hip Hop to name a few. Everything sounds great, the only thing about these is that if your looking for Thumping Bass these aren't for you, Not that they don't have Bass, its just not thumping Bass but Definitely there. Before you go and spend over a $100 on Bose or anything else I would give these a look, you won't regret it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing, By far the Best Headphones I've ever used", "unixReviewTime": 1292198400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2010"}
