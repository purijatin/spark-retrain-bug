It will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering - you can hear them all on Sony's. But with Bose the bass will sound better and that is it - nothing else!I am so happy I got the MDR-V6 instead of Bose! (When I got my Sony both were almost same price.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These beat the Bose around-ear headphones by FAR!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1250121600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2009"}
