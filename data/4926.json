Dahl", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I ordered my Sony MDR-v6 on November 24, 2012 sold by Amazon and received them Monday December 3, 2012 with free super shipping.The reason for my purchase of this is because of the large amount of positive reviews.my initial reaction to this headphone was \"Ouch\" because it has a higher response to treble than my last headphoneand what it has excess in for treble, it lacks in bass. I really expected more bass, I can even crank up the lowerband of my EQ and it still hasn't got enough kick to my liking.but after a few days of listening, my ears adapted.Many people believe there is a headphone \"burn in\" but I believe this to be personal hearing adapting to the sound.the sound is okay, it's nothing mind-blowing, my Sentry 880CD headphone (which cost far less) sound just as good as this (if not better)the reason I say \"If not better\" is because the Sony MDR-V6 has a quiet, but noticeable hissing sound at all times,even when there is no music playing, my Sentry do not exhibit this quality.in fact, I would rather have purchased Sentry 880CD again instead of this, my expectations were too high due to the over-exaggerated reviews of others.The Sony do have better isolation than the Sentry, but I am not worried if others hear my music.the clamping force is not as tight as desired or expected, many of the reviews claim it's too tight. This was another factor in why I made my purchase,I wanted tight headphones because the tighter they are, the better they sound. This headphone slopes down and the band rests uncomfortably on the top of my head.all-in-all I am not completely disappointed in this purchase, the Sony MDR-V6 headphone does sound good, but it is not as other exaggerated reviews would have you believe.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "They're good, not spectacular", "unixReviewTime": 1355097600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012"}
