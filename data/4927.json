Relatively comfortable but do tend to squish my head after a while,Only real complaint is they bleed sound.  You ever sat net to someone that had their headphones not blaring, but still a bit loud and you could really hear them clearly?  Yeah, I don't like that either.  I've owned other big headphones like this that did a good job of sealing in the music so that everyone around them didn't have to listen to it too.  These don't do that.  The sound is great for me, but my wife complains all the time that they're disturbing her.Other than that, good headphones for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very good headphones, but not perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}
