I used other brands and Sony models over the years and nothing came close to this--uncolored, accurate sound and especially its tight--not exaggerated--bass response. Until I discovered the MDR-V6, which I've heard has been around almost as long as the MDR-CD6. The only difference is that the MDR-V6 is more comfortable as it completely encloses my ears (the MDR-CD6 pads were smaller and rested on my ears, not around them). This is an excellent value for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Replaces my classic Sony MDR-CD6", "unixReviewTime": 1344384000, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2012"}
