Ryder", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewtext": "I have always had a pair of headphones, usually purchased at Best Buy or something similar. I used to think price= quality. Turns out in the audio universe, that just isn't true. These headphones are really great for the price, and even for a $150 pair of headphones.Look, bottom line is: these are marvelous headphones. But connected to your laptop or other digital source, you will be missing out on SO MUCH audio quality. Everything either needs to be analog, or you need a semi high-quality USB DAC. Do some research, because given the proper signals, these headphones will really blow your mind. And take all these reviews with a grain of salt. One reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an iPod and another might be reviewing on a $10k audiophile setup.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sound, price, comfort.
