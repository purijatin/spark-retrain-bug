I did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and I wasn't left hanging. The sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me. I'm not really into how the Beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but that's just me. If you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint : ) !! I once had bad headphones but now I hear !!
