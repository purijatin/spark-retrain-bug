I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better. These are just right.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones with real studio headphone sound", "unixReviewTime": 1318032000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2011"}
