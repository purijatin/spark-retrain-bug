These are the real deal. The only point I give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord. It's long and somewhat bulky, but manageable. The sound reproduction, particularly at the bass end, is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect.Don't bother looking further. I've done it and tried most of them. I'd put these up against anything else, even more expensive brands, on the market.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1261958400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2009"}
