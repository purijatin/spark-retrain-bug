I will leave sonic reviews to others, but I do not like booming and distorted bass, such as with the extremely overpriced (IMO) Beats headphones.  The V6 seems to be a good value with fairly flat response and reasonable sensitivity.I have a large head and these are comfortable to me. Sound isolation is good, much better than I thought it would be given the comfort and size.After reading about the pad wear, I will try periodic cleaning with a vinyl conditioner.  I ordered these with a coiled cord which is a heavier than a straight cord, so pay attention when ordering if cord type is important to you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good value used for ipod", "unixReviewTime": 1354406400, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2012"}
