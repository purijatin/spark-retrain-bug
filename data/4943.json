I have these, and love them. These are closed-ear, clinical, precise sounding cans. They are hot on your ears. They are harsh. They are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences. When you're mixing music, you need to listen on a variety of sources, sources you expect your music to be heard on: iPod earbuds, car stereos, AM radios, Disco sound systems etc. These are great because they relentlessly show detail. If your mix sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything. BUT If you are looking for a comfortable, moving listening experience; check out Grado. Audiophile quality, rich and beautiful. Recordings mixed with these Sony's will sound spectacular on Grados. These are an incredible tool, but they are built for a purpose, and it's work, not pleasure.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not for enjoyment listening", "unixReviewTime": 1253923200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2009"}
