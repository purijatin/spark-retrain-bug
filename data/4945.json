The headphones themselves are very comfortable even with the pleather. They're actually really compact compared to many cans at this price. Lows, mids and highs are all excellent for under $100. The build quality is nothing less than superb as expected, doesn't feel plasticy or vulnerable to breakage at all. Need time to break in these new cans but I can say that these are similar to the HD280s but the Sony's are more comfortable and less costly. I recommend these to anyone looking for affordable headphones for music or monitoring in general.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Cans!", "unixReviewTime": 1262044800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2009"}
