The problems with the liner are well documented.However, my son grabbed them to wear when playing his online games and that was that.So, I went shopping for a new pair and decided to try the MDR V6.I'm impressed.Some reviewers consider them uncomfortably tight, but I'm fine, and I have a \"large head\". The cushions are reasonable soft and provide good isolation.It's the fidelity that blows me away for the price.  The volume is good (again, too many years on a carrier deck, I \"need\" volume) and the bass is smooth and rich without being obnoxious.  The higher frequencies are clear and sharp without abrasive characteristics.The adapter is the \"smaller\" 1/8\" that is common to iPads, phones, notebooks, etc. A bonus is a nice 1/4\" jack that doesn't just snap onto the smaller one but screws on tight!  Nice quality touch.For the price?  Excellent, and highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceeds Expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1333929600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2012"}
