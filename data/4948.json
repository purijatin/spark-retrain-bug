And i have no luck with headphones, these seem very good . costly but  is a great value. Here are my thoughts .They  look well made. The  weight for the headphones is not as heavy as some may think. I use them for hours daily.I even walk around with them. being a women i don,t like heavy weight. So i find the weight good. The ear pads are very soft, also replaceable  which you can't do with some. The fit is an over the ear .They look kind of big, but don't let that fool you. I am a women with small ears , they fit nicely . The cord is one sided , and thick. It also looks like a phone cord .I wish the cord was replaceable .  I don't think  I will need to replace Them . The length of the cord is longer than others . That is great for me because my CD player is on my book case near the couch. The sound is great even with the volume at low  sound. You don't need to put it that loud. The balance of the sound is well balanced. can fold them , which is great for draws. Lets talk pouches soft well made  with a drew string. I like pouches in my opinion . I hope this helps you make up your mind.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lets talk headphones you decide after reading!", "unixReviewTime": 1371772800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2013"}
