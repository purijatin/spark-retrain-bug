Sony packaged it like it was a limited edition.  I paid 50 bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around 75.  Very solid sound and great for monitoring, I thought about needing a 300 dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you won't get more out of a more expensive set than this.  I'm not sure what's the difference between this and MDR7506 but I can only image how awesome the professional ones are though.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1360713600, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2013"}
