It is detailed and well-balanced across the frequency range. I am happy to listen for extended periods and the headphones are comfortable. I cannot comment on thumping deep bass because I listen to the wrong kind of music for that. I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago but gave them to a family member. This newer pair cost much less but sound every bit as good.On sound quality alone I would give these five stars but the construction is a bit concerning. Pulling on the extenders to lower the earcups feels as if it is pulling the headband apart. The old pair extended smoothly. I don't know if quality has gone down or I just got a wonky pair. Since I can leave the earcups extended this is not an ongoing problem but it does raise questions about overall quality. I haven't had any other similar issues so far.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent sound but so-so construction", "unixReviewTime": 1369094400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2013"}
