Stein", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought these for a trifecta purpose.1)  I can use them while recording music.2)  I can have over-the-ear cans to listen to my mp3's3)  So I can enjoy music again.I'm not single anymore (haven't been for a LONG time), and I don't have the set-up that I used to have in order to listen to music at the volume I enjoyed.  Nor do I drive my car often enough to be able to listen to much more than a few tracks at a time.  Then my wife complains if I turn my music up past 3 on the volume knob.  So I pretty much fell out of the music listening loop over the years.  Music was, and has been a huge part of my life, and I miss it.  Now, with these cans, I can lock myself in the basement, sit back, and be that dude on the old Memorex packaging being blown away in his chair.  These things make music sound SO much better than it does coming through any loudspeaker.  It's like you're right there with it.  These aren't even on the same playing field as earbuds, and those expensive Dre Beats headphones suck compared to these.  After comparing the two, I'm SO glad I didn't waste my money on Beats.  I will likely buy a few more pairs of these so I don't have to keep transferring them from one device to the next.  And I took the advice of other reviewers and picked up theBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)to replace the ones that came on it.  They are much more comfortable and don't cause your ears to sweat nearly as bad as the ones that come on it.If you are a true music aficionado, you will not regret this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Allows me to enjoy music again", "unixReviewTime": 1337731200, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2012"}
