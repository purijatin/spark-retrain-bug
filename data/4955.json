The retailer I got them from is long gone but these babies are still available.  Not that I need them, they still function perfectly.  I keep one on the computer and one on the stereo.  They are not the best sounding cans I've heard as I own a set of Stax.  BUT they are the best monitors I've ever used.  A little hot/harsh above 10KHz but that's what you need to hear what you've got.  They can smell any clipping.  The Stax earpads have gotten flaky but these Sony's have aged well.  They get dropped, ripped off my head etc. all the time, no problem.  They fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything.  I wear them for hours comfortably.  I have other Sonys, Sennheisers, Beyers and others that I can't listen to anymore because of these.  There is no better value that I know of.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My standard", "unixReviewTime": 1172793600, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2007"}
