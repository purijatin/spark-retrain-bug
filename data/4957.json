After receipt, I tried them out with my 5 Star iTunes playlist. I had been using Etymotics ear buds, but wanted a longer cord and an over the ear style. The Sony beat them hand downs. I had originally ordered a pair of Audio-Technica ($148.00). To me, the Audio-Technica muffled the bass sounds a bit and didn't give me the crisp highs that I had expected, or was used to. I returned those and ordered the Sony MDR-V6 (about $85), and couldn't be happier! Better than the Etymotic ear buds - solid bass - but not too much., and nice crisp highs. Also, they are a bit more comfortable than the Audio-Technica, and a lot less expensive! The Sony's are solid!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow, Just Wow - Better than Headphones at Almost Twice the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2014"}
