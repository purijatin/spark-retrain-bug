The others aren't lying, these headphones are unbelievable.  I find them extremely comfortable, and don't think they feel heavy like others have said.  The build quality is top notch, and feel like they could last for the 10-15 years that others' have.As far as the sound goes, they seem to do better with real music than fake.  Basically, if you're listening to classical, jazz, acoustic, vocals or classic rock, I can't imagine anything could ever reproduce sound better.  I've listened to Led Zeppelin for 20 years, and now I'm re-listening, hearing (and feeling) subtle sounds I never heard before.  They'll almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albums.Where they seem to fail is with fake music, such as rap, hip hop, or anything else created with synthesizers or computers.  If that sort of non-music is your thing, you may be better off with the Dre headphones.  If real music is what you listen to, you absolutely have to buy these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best things I've ever own", "unixReviewTime": 1315872000, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2011"}
