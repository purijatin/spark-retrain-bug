I have not experienced the discomfort many other reviewers mentioned as a con in their reviews. I use these with my high definition audio recorder, and can hear every detail. I've also used them to listen to music, and have found them to be quite a pleasure!If I were to nitpick, I'd say the coiled cord is a bit cumbersome due to its weight. If you're using this with a small device, such as I do with my Zoom H1 audio recorder, it will definitely need some care so it doesn't tip the device over or pull it off a table. Not a huge problem and not really a con for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome!", "unixReviewTime": 1358467200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2013"}
