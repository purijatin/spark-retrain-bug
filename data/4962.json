They sound fantastic and feel very comfortable after watching 2 hour long movies or listening to long music sessions while working around the house.Keep in mind, like most headphones, they require time to &#34;burn in.&#34; Out of the box the highs sounded off and bass was mediocre. After a week of listening the headphones sound fantastic and keep getting better. Remember this when purchasing these headphones. If you can get them for the 50 bucks I got them, then I promise you will enjoy the sound and the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}
