I don't do a whole much with these headphones but plug them into my iPhone to listen to podcasts and the weird music I have collected. It's hard to describe but these headphones are comfortable and they don't seem to get in the way at all, aurally.Headphones are so personal that I can't say these will be the best for you. They're not perfect for me; the cord pulls my iPhone off the table for example. But they're nice enough that they're what I use every day.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable and clear.", "unixReviewTime": 1386201600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2013"}
