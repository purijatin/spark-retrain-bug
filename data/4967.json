Do I have big ears?  Maybe.  The cushion is a half inch thick until you put them on.  Then it compresses down to about 3/8, which makes the speaker portion press against my ears.  The sound is quite good, not the best I've heard, but suits my purpose, which is for editing music.  The bass is a little heavy for my taste, but more closely resembles what I hear from my room speakers.  Highs are decent.  The response seems reasonably flat - at least I can hear almost all of the highs, except the really high highs such as the hiss from the electronics.  Quite lite and comfortable, but not as comfortable as I would like them to be.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quite good sound, but not as comfortable as I would like.", "unixReviewTime": 1381276800, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2013"}
