I read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones.  They are as described. Sounds crispy and I think it gets better as you use them.  Very good isolation, despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing.  Frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too. Excelent ratio quality-price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "sony mdr-v6", "unixReviewTime": 1348272000, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2012"}
