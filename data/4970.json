I purchased them &#34;used&#34; from Amazon warehouse and I can't tell them from a brand new pair. I compared the sound quality against a set of $300 Bose QC 15's that I have for my many business trips and the Sony's sound significantly better. Of course, they are not noise cancelling, so I will still use the QC15 for trips. But for listening around the house or at the office, hands down I would use the V6s.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best sound by far", "unixReviewTime": 1369699200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2013"}
