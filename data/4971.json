Wm Rhea III", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I  have owned many pairs of head phones over the years and listened to many more.  These offer simply the best sound experience that I have had.  I have even listened with more costly Sony headphones and found them lacking in comparison to these.  I have been able to rediscover some of my music with these wonderful head phones.They are so good that many members of my family have also recently bought them.  If you love to really hear your music, do yourself a favor and buy a pair of these, but make sure you read the warnings - they can cause damage to credit card magnetic strips and mechanical devices with small springs (e.g.  watches).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best headphones I've ever owned or heard!", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}
