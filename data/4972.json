I also own a pair of  MDR7506's and the sound is indistinguishable between them.  Hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great.  And it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from Sony's parts division.The Sennheiser HD280 is the main competitor to the V6/MDR7506.  Connected to studio/home equipment, the HD280 may be a better choice for classical, jazz and acoustic music.  The mids sound a little cleaner than the V6.  Having said that the HD280 is larger than the V6 and requires more power for equal loudness and bass.  iPods and MP3 players just don't have enough juice to power the Sennheiser; the V6 is more efficient.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better choice for iPods than Sennheiser HD280", "unixReviewTime": 1197244800, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2007"}
