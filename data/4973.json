I've owned these for a year now and I must say I'm so glad I bought them. When I bought these I was on a budget of under $100 and now that I have more funds I've been shopping around for something better, but everything I've listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another. Either they're uncomfortable or don't sound as well, but either way I gave up and I have gladly decided to stick with my MDR-V6s. The attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible, especially in a car/plane. You can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat. Only pitfall is my head gets a little warm and my hair gets tussled but I'm ok with it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1317168000, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2011"}
