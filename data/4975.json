This headphone is from the last generation (age-wise).  It has better quality than many current more expensive name-brand models by different manufacturers.  Good sound quality for the money.  However, I have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented.  My son loves it and it doesn't bother him.  He is using it all the time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}
