Nice bass, lots of detail, maybe slightly (very slightly) rolled off in the treble.  This is the Shure vMR-TypeV of headphones.  A big plus:  Very efficient so can be used with lower output devices (think iPods and CD players with built-in headphone jacks).  I've compared the Sony's to the Grado-SR80i and I think it's close but they don't sound alike...but then there's the comfort issue:  You wear the Sony's long enough and your ears are going to get sweaty; otherwise I find the Sony's very comfortable.  If you don't like the ear pads, B&H apparently offers velour ear pad replacements (from Pearlstone) that might help.  BTW, I own two of these headphones:  One from ~15+ years ago and a recent pair.  They sound identical.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still fantastic after all these years...and great for iPods!", "unixReviewTime": 1322438400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2011"}
