Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal. I almost never need a 3m coiled cord. I'll probably follow one of the excellent DIY cord replacements online.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Phenomenal Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1398211200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2014"}
