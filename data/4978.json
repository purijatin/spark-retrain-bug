With today's 2-3 year product cycle, old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast, forcing many once revered products into retirement. This is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is Sony; a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than 2 years. So why have they stuck around for so long? Simple; because they're amazing. No set of headphones in this price class (and several above) can hope to come close to how balanced these things are. All frequencies are represented accurately; just as they were recorded and without any coloration. Bass lines aren't bloated mess's like in many modern headphones, mid range frequencies are as they should be; in existence, and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears. Though not as detailed as a set of $500 headphones, these are not anywhere close to that. Hovering around $65 most days, these cans provide incredible value. Don't take this the wrong way; they're not amazing for what they are, they're amazing period. Buy these for editing, sound stage monitoring, or neutral listening and you won't be disappointed. Though if you buy these because you want \"street cred\" and bass that makes your heart beat backwards, you clearly didn't understand a word I said.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing Value, Excellent sound, a Classic.", "unixReviewTime": 1324944000, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2011"}
