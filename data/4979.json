I listened to Audio Technica and Dr.Dre's Beats headphones and In my opinion the Sony cans sound the best. The Dynamic range is Great. Good Bass, Clarity at the same time. I use mine with \"cMoy Headphone Amplifier\" and it shines truly with it. I am using it from last 12 yrs and I enjoyed it all these years. I am happy to see Sony still makes them. I will definitely order one more headphones for my family members.Pros:Excellent sound stage, Great Highs and Lows.
