Cases", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewtext": "OK, let me start off by saying that i did a lot of research on plenty of headphones before i chose to buy the sony mdr-v6 headphones. I was going to choose the sennheiser 280 until there were several reviews saying that it doesn't go well with an ipod. Anyways these headphones are really good. I'm currently into eight hours of breaking it in. When i first opened these headphones and plugged it into my computer and i was extremely disappointed. The sound quality was almost exactly the same as my cheap $15 headphone and the sound was ridiculously bright(High treble). I was ready to return this product until i thought to myself i needed to break it in first to really judge it. After six hours of breaking it in the sound quality changed dramatically. i mean i thought i was listening to a new pair of headphones. Right now it is sounding great and i'm currently at eight hours of breaking it in. There is still bright sound but not has horrid as when i first plugged it in. People that have these headphones are suggesting thirty hours. I really recommand that everyone breaks in these headphones first before listening to it but i don't recommand this product for people who don't like bright sound and people that are looking to sugar coat their current music.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1196640000, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2007"}
