Anderson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I purchased these to replace an old pair of V600's that had served me well for nearly a decade, and the quality of sound out of these is as close to perfection as I've ever heard.  It has crisp, clear highs, and the bass is unbelievable.  I'm hearing bass notes that I've never heard before in a pair of headphones, and what's amazing is that the bass doesn't overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound.  I tested on my laptop and my iPod and set the EQ to flat on both, and the sound is near perfectly balanced: no muddy bass, weak midtones or tinny highs, just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experience.The phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear.  The padding on the cups is thinner than on past models, which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head, but they're every bit as comfortable as the older V600's that I replaced.  The headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player.  It comes with a 3.5mm to 1/4\" adapter so that you can plug it into full-size headphone jacks on stereos.  If you're going to use it on a home stereo, I'd recommend getting a 6-10' extension cord for it, unless of course you can sit close to your receiver.These are an incredible deal in my opinion.  I can't imagine much better sound at any price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Phenomenal!", "unixReviewTime": 1212019200, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2008"}
