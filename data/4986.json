I have loved using them everyday since the day I first heard a CD play on them. The sound is like liquid sxx in my ear canal. I seriously had to spend some quality time with the lights out and my CD player and these HPs. I still have my original HPs and they sound just like the virgin HPs I unwrapped the day I first heard digital music. I use the MDR7506 on my Digi 002 for Pro Tools sessions, but they sound exactly like these imo. I'm emotionally attached to these HPs though. The MDR7506 is what's in the studio for anyone. I keep these MDR-V6 for ME. I bought these in a special Gold Edition wrapped in red satin pillow with a special screw on 1/4\" adapter. I lost the adapter and the satin pillow hit the file 13. I bought another 1/4\" adapter from a local store for my midi keyboard. I like the ability for these HPs to be worn with one ear folded up so you can listen to yourself sing and listen to your audio at the same time.[...]+++EDIT DEC 2011 **********************************************************-Sony dot com is selling these today and they have better response than 7506 HP , its V6 5-30k and 7506 10-20k[...]-sweetwater dot com sells the beyerdynamic DT250 earpads that are better than the sony ones after a few years.
