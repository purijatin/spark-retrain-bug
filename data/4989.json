Not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound, but they're also lightweight and extremely comfortable.  They fit firmly on your head, cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vice.My dad bought a pair of the Koss Pro4AA Titaniums and I have to say that this Sony pair blows those away. While the sound quality is similarly great, the Koss's are about 5X as heavy!  They really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour.  The Sony's are much more comfortable and MUCH more lightweight and portable.  I definetely recommend these.  You won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I've ever heard", "unixReviewTime": 1154131200, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2006"}
