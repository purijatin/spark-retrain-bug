It provides awesome sound isolation. The bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days. the v6 provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy. the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn. other than than, these sound great. The downside is that the hinge is plastic.  I hope they will not snap after prolong use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "awesome headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1178928000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007"}
