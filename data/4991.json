Chevalier", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Bought these to replace a pair of Bose headphones that broke apart after 4 years.  I didn't want to spend a ton of cash on a higher end so after reading reviews; I settled on these.  I have to say, these are better than the $179 bose headphones I bought.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Bass isn't too overwhelming.  I mostly use these to listen to my iPod, but it's almost got me wanting to set up a home studio and get started on some recording to really test them out.  Only drawback is the exposed wires.  I'm afraid that if I adjust these it might pinch.  I will just have to be careful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice!", "unixReviewTime": 1339286400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2012"}
