The V6's produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music I never knew existed.  I've got a Denon-Bose audio setup worth about $2000 and these headphones sound better.These headphones are ridiculous.  They're worth about $300 by my standards.  It also appears they are built to last, as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead Sony's normal cheap sh**.Update: the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat.  I strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous pets.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best sound I've ever heard", "unixReviewTime": 1120521600, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2005"}
