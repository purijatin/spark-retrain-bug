They are worth every single penny, and I think they sound better than the Beats.I like to listen a lot of rock, alternative, hip-hop and electronic. John Mayer, Justin Nozuka, Santana sound so good through these headphones. If you like listening to mainstream hip-hop, the bass in these headphones will go down low without distortion. Listening to Daft Punk and Justice through these headphones made me love them even more.If you love listening to an array of music genres, your ears definitely be satisfied for a lifetime with these headphones.I also use these headphones as studio monitors when I record my own music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I thought I wanted Beats by Dre, then I got these.", "unixReviewTime": 1293667200, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2010"}
