They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then.  They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.  I went without nice headphones for several years, I am very happy that they still sell this model, they are compact, have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame.  They are by far the best value in headphones, kudos for Sony for keeping production running.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1249084800, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2009"}
