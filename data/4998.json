Fig.", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Just like the title of my review says, I've had these since 2009 and haven't had a single issue with them. Sony knew they hit the ball out the park with this model and have kept them in stock. What you get is a high quality set of head phones with a very durable coiled cord and a very convenient bag that has come with me to trips around Europe and back. While they're not the best for noise canceling for when flying (not really intended to) they do make up with great sound, a punchy bass, balanced mids and highs and all without the need for an amp, but don't get me wrong, using an amp is also a great option. The specs are:Impedance : 63 ohmsDriver Unit : 40mmSensitivity (db) : 106dB/mWFrequency Response : 5Hz - 30,000HzHope this helps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've Had These Since 2009. Still Going.
