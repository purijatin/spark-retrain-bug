Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Headphones.
