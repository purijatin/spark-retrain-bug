I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED, HOWEVER, BY THE EXPOSED WIRES CONNECTING EACH SIDE OF THE EARPHONES.  THESE EARPHONES SOUND VERY GOOD WITH SOLID BASS AND OVERALL CLARITY. THEY DID SEEM A LITTLE HARSH ON THE HIGH SIDE, BUT WERE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.  WHILE I LIKE THE OVERALL SOUND OF THESE EARPHONES, THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS SMOOTH AS MY JVC HA-DX3 EARPHONES, WHICH I CONSIDER THE VERY BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "SONY V6 EARPHONES", "unixReviewTime": 1342224000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2012"}
