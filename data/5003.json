They sound great! I have many other sets of headphones and these are by far the best.  I thought the others where great until I heard stuff through the v6s. You will hear things in your music you never heard before.  They block out noise and are very comfortable on my big head, yet they fold down for easy travel.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome sound reproduction.", "unixReviewTime": 1190246400, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2007"}
