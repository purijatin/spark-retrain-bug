Linn Rash", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I have owned these headphones for somewhere between 10 and 15 years and they sound as good today as the day I bought them.  I have not treated them the best.  I toss them in the drawer, I toss them in a basket.  Sometimes I fold them up and sometimes I don't.  I don't know what some other reviewers have done to their headphones but mine have been rode hard and put away wet, and still look and sound terrific.  They sound great cranked way up or very soft.  I use them for my ipod, my stereo, my computer and my TV.  The only thing that has gone wrong is the coiled cord has stretched over time and is a bit awkward to deal with. I can live with it.  I have owned some Bose triports and have listened to many others while browsing around audio stores and these MDR v6's sound as good or better than anything else I have tried.  I recently gave my son the Boses' and I kept the Sony MDR V6s'.  They are made with quality materials, fit well, don't get hot or heavy and sound excellent. The bass is accurate, full but not overdone. The mids and highs are crisp and balanced.  By the way, in comparison to others in the market today they are cheap.  I'm guessing mine will last several more years but just in case I'm going to snatch up another bargain set and stash them away for the day the music dies.  I have enjoyed these headphones every time I put them on and in my opinion you can't go wrong with the Sony MDR V6!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "10 Years Use and they're still the ones I Prefer", "unixReviewTime": 1351209600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2012"}
