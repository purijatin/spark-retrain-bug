I've also used some for gaming and movie watching.The MDR-V6 are the best I've used so far. I'm not claiming to be a pro. These might be mediocre overall if I were able to compare them other 'cans' in the headphone world.All I know is that these sound healthy. I can hear a deep level of bass. It doesn't rumble your ears but you can hear very low frequencies. For example, if I pop on some DJ Magic Mike (that Miami bass music crud), I can hear all the low end sounds for the most part. Deep rich sound overall.These days I mostly use these for late night movie watching while my son is asleep. They do the job very well for me.My only miniscule complaint is the fatigue on my outer ear from the cans pushing in against them. I can get a couple hours in before it becomes irritating, sometimes 4 hours or more if I have them placed perfectly over my ears. This is normal though and all headphones do this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best headphones I've personally ever used", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}
