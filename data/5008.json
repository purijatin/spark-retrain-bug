These headphones not only sound terriffic but they are also very comfortable.  Super soft covers on each ear piece and the stretchy cord is a nice touch too.  This set feels good in your hands, and on your head, the quality is obvious and its a well made product.  I used these on a long set of flights recently and was able to watch many hours of movies and TV shows before I started to feel any discomfort while wearing them.  And that is really saying something!  I highly recommend these for general use, even if you have a large head.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very comfortable headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1371427200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2013"}
