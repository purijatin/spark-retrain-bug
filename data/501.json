By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own. Most of my books are in PDF format. It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com. All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation.
