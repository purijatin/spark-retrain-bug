This pair was a gift for my grandson.  There was a problem with them when I received them.  The insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones.

If I ever need another pair this is what I'll buy again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I've ever owned", "unixReviewTime": 1392422400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2014"}
