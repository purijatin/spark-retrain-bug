Night and day from my previous set.Sure, the sound quality is awesome, that much I expected....... but the comfort... amazing.  I can see myself wearing these for hours without a thought.Anyone else who says these are uncomfortable either has a really large head and doesn't know it, or simply isn't telling us.  These have room to spare on my head and my head isn't small... I\"m 6' 220lbs...Either way, these are awesome.  Definitely would recommend these to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "oh wow...", "unixReviewTime": 1337644800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2012"}
