Be aware that these will go very loud--far more than most--so be wary when you listen a lot.I have had a pair for around 25 years--and I have replaced the ear pads--and they have worked fine always. I paid $100 when I bought them--around $210 in today's dollars. This price is exceptional. I was going to buy another pair--but saw no need. Professionals use them. I have had many other good ones--but--these are in a class by themselves. You will not be disappointed.Another good choice is the Sennheiser HD202--my second favorite pair and a bargain.And I hope all of you realize that \"ear buds\"--are just wrong--useful only in unusual circumstances.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply the Best", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"}
