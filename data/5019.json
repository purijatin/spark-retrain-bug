They're quite comfortable (thinking about replacing the vinyl ear cushions with velour ones as the vinyl ones make my ears a bit sweaty after extended use..). I won't go into audio quality as there are plenty of reviews that do that. The build quality is superb. The coiled cable is sturdy, and the plug weighs almost as much as my cell phone! The included adapter screws on very securely. I ordered a few headphones when I was deciding on a pair and these beat out the XB500 as well as comparable Sennheiser and Sure headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1350172800, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2012"}
