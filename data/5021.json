Parmelee", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "First of all I'm not a musician,director or studio engineer( just a really big music and entertainment fan) and have tried several headphones and actually owned about 4 headphones in the same price range as the V6(and a lot of much cheaper ones) in the past  and while the ones I liked  were great in their own right, the Sony MDR V6s are the best sounding headphones I've ever listened to. The sound is very even and natural yet extremely detailed and not at all \"lifeless\" or \"boring\" to listen to. They have a really deep, smooth,rich yet accurate bass sound and have crystal clear treble and mid range.Overall, there may be other headphones that cost twice as much that sound better but for the price when it comes to sound, the Sony MDR V6s sound absolutely flawless for the money and they are a true bargain. These headphones are not only beautiful to listen to and come beautifully packaged they are also very comfortable and durable. I have had these headphones for 5 years and haven't even had to replace the ear pads yet and I can listen to these headphones for hours without taking a break. The V6s are very similar to the 7506s in sound and appearance but I think the V6s are actually clearer and even more detailed to my ears.It can debated by people that they sound the same but to my ears I can honestly say the V6s sound better to my ears and they have an even longer cord than the 7506s so buying a headphone extension cord is not necessary.Overall, I would definitely recommend the V6 to anyone looking for a great sounding,durable,accurate and affordable set of headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The MDR V6s are Sony's masterpiece and an industry standard.", "unixReviewTime": 1095465600, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2004"}
