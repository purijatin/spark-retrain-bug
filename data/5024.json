Schwarz", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I had these headphones for about 15 years and I have to say the sound quality is excellent. The fact that they are still looking good means they are well made.  If you have a chance to buy them then don't hesitate because you will not get a similar value for the price anywhere.  About two years ago I ordered the replacement pads from Sony and just installed them yesterday, and now the headphones look like new.  As for the fit, they are comfortable but tight and after a number of hours I can see why some people complain about sore ears.  There is a slight difference in the older headphones according to the specs because the older ones used a Samarian cobalt magnet and these don't so maybe the cobalt was not as easy to obtain any more.  Now they are almost the same as the MDR7506 but with a better audio range so why pay double the price?  Now my only decision is whether to buy another pair when I have a fine working one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great value that can't be beat", "unixReviewTime": 1333152000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2012"}
