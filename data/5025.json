I review lots of classical music CDs here at Amazon and if I listened to them all via loudspeakers it would probably drive my wife nuts. So I often use these headphones instead. Another reason I do that is that I find that the sound they deliver is a clear analog of the sound I get from high quality loudspeakers. I find I can wear them comfortably for as long as I'm listening -- and sometimes that's hours at a time -- and never have the urge, as I do with other headphones, to take them off because of physical or aural discomfort.More recently I got an iPod -- my kids went together for my birthday and bought me the fanciest iPod available! -- and I find that these headphones are MUCH more comfortable and acoustically accurate than those darn earbuds that come with the iPod. I do notice that these headphones apparently have greater impedance than the earbuds; that is, the volume control has to be turned up a bit to get the same volume as delivered by the earbud. But the improvement in auditory accuracy and comfort is more than worth it.Thumbs up on this tried-and-true classic set of headphones.Scott Morrison", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've Had My Sony MDR-V6s Fifteen Years and They're Still Wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1180137600, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2007"}
