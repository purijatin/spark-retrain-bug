These cans are legendary in the audio world. With a flat frequency response, they are very EQ friendly. These headphones will definitely tell you the quality of your music so it is best to have your MP3's with the highest bitrate possible, or use FLAC whenever you can. I have read that some people are disappointed with the sound, it is not the headphones!!! It is your music source and the equipment used. It is best that you have some kind of headphone amplifier or good audio gear to drive them as ipods and the like do not have the power to properly push them.These are my go to headphones when I want to have a good listening experience.As a last note, Sony has quietly retired the MDR-V6's after nearly 30 years of service!!!! I ordered an extra pair just in case and I also have the MDR-7506 as well but prefer the old tried and true MDR-V6.Get them while you can and beware of knock-offs!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get them while you can-They Sound Professional", "unixReviewTime": 1374278400, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2013"}
