Then the ear pads stared to deteriorate and leave black specks on my ears and face. Instead of spending too much money for replacement pads I decided it was time to buy a new set of headphones. After doing some research and reading reviews I bought my first set of MDR-V6 Monitor Series headphones. I'm happy that I did. The sound is better than my old ones and they are very comfortable on my ears. Also, the price was reasonable. From the reviews, I realize not everybody agrees on quality and comfort. All I can do is express my own experience. I'm very satisfied with these and recommend them. I understand that these pads will deteriorate, also. You'd think that Sony could make pads that won't fall apart after a few years use.Update:These ear pads are starting to deteriorate and get loose, also. SONY!, please improve your quality control and make ear pads that last! I can buy replacements, but I shouldn't have to. I never DID find replacement pads anywhere for the MDR-V200 headphones that weren't more expensive than buying new headphones. /rant", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1257638400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2009"}
