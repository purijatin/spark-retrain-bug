The V6s were awesome then, and are still awesome today.  Sony came out with the MDR-V600 'phones later, and when I wore out my original MDR-V6 'phones, I tried those out.  What a waste of money.  The MDR-V6 units are much clearer, have lots punchier bass, and just sound \"in your face\".  The V-600s sound muffled and weak in comparison.  I'm glad Sony listened to their customers and re-issued the V6s after they were discontinued.  They also sell the identical headphones under a \"professional\" model number MDR-7506.  You'll pay about $30 more for the 7506s, and they do have a longer warranty (3 years as opposed to 1) and fancy gold-colored jacks, but my original V6s lasted about 10 years before needing to be replaced, and who cares what color the jacks are?  I highly recommend these 'phones to anyone who needs accurate, tight, clear sounding 'phones.  If you want the longer warranty and silly gold colored jacks, buy the costlier MDR-7506 \"professional\" ones.  Either way, you'll enjoy awesome sound.Pros:Clear highs, punchy bassHigh sensitivity - 106 dB at 1mWComes with a soft drawstring carrying caseComes with a 1/8\" to 1/4\" screw-on TRS plug adapterCons:Can be a little uncomfortable over extended periods of use (over an hour for me), but you can find replacement pads for the earpads that afford a little more comfort. Search Amazon for \"sony 211566803\".  Should be around $12 or so.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sets the bar for great quality, affordable, circumaural headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1264550400, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2010"}
