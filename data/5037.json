Great sounding phones like these are hard to find at a good price. They are very comfortable and they filter out noise around you. The sound is clear and accurate. I heard sound from my music I never heard before.Thats why I give the Sony MDR-V6, A Best Buy 5 star rating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Buy!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1254960000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2009"}
