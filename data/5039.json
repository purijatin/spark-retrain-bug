I had to replace the ear pads, but that was the best thing I could have done since I replaced them with the velour pads. They are so comfortable. These are also awesome for plane trips because they seem to block out most of the noise. I don't really know if that was the case with the stock pads. I hope the new ones are still as good as the old ones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still going strong after sooooo many years", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014"}
