This left me concerned about whether or not I should buy these or continue looking.  After all, they didn't include any head measurements that I could use to compare my own head with.On the other hand, most reviewers said the sound quality was excellent.  So I went ahead and ordered a pair.I received them today, and I'm happy to report these headphones are very comfortable on my head.  (my head measurement = 21 3/4 inches which is 55 centimeters)  The headphones stay firmly on my head even when I turn my head. I don't hear any type of distortion when I turn my head.  I wear glasses and the headphones are still comfortable on my ears.Without any stretching, the cord is long enough to go down to the floor and then around to the back of my PC which sits on the floor below my desk.  The cord will stretch out longer.  The cord doesn't pull on the headphones or provide any type of discomfort.The sound quality is excellent as stated by the other reviewers. In fact, I have the volume turned almost all the way down on iTunes and I can still hear the music very clearly.I would recommend these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very comfortable on head - not too tight at all", "unixReviewTime": 1243036800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2009"}
