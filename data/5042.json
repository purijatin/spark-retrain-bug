UPDATED INFO AT THE END OF THE ORIGINAL REVIEW. ***I actually purchased these for field listening while recording commercial video and have used them occasionally as backups for enjoying my music on my laptop, iPod and Android phone. The sound is very good, with solid bass response and crisp highs, but they actually hurt my ears (physically, not aurally) if I leave them on too long...which usually equates in to anything more than 15 minutes.For the record, my hat size is a 7 1/4, so I would say the overall size of my head is average. A person with a larger head size may find even more discomfort in a shorter amount of wear time.In the past I had used the less expensive Sony Monitor headphones found in department stores. The sound was adequate, but I felt I wanted something more professional. These are definitely a step up from the Sony department store models, but same uncomfortable ear fitment.The bonus to these is they fold up nice and compact for better storage, so I don't have to worry so much about breaking them. They also come with an inexpensive little carrying pouch for added protection.Bottom line: Sound great, but uncomfortable for periods of long listening.*** 7/23/2013 UPDATE ***These did not last long. The left side stopped working and I had to throw these out. I paid too much for a pair of uncomfortable headphones that didn't even last as long as the cheaper Studio Monitors I've bought at Target. It was enough for me to know I am done with Sony headphones.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good sound, but not comfortable for long periods.
