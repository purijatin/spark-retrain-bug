I've never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone.  I'm hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that I never heard before.  And the price couldn't be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping.  My only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding Headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1217894400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2008"}
