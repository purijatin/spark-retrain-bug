Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not find the lows stronger or weaker than the mid-range and highs.  The set is comfortable, and the cups insulates noises well (not to compare to noise-canceling headphones).  All that said, I still feel that the set should cost at $15-$20 less.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Decent Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1226361600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2008"}
