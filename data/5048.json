I did a lot of research before purchasing these. Before continuing, some notes:-Sony is no longer manufacturing this product. These headphones were designed in 1985 and Sony attempted to cancel the manufacturing of this product years ago, but upon popular request, were forced to remake the product. They then cancelled them again and are no longer on the Sony site.-There are really well-made replicas afoot. If you purchase this product, verify that they are a Sony authorized retailer.-You need a powerful audio source to get good sound out of them. Do not plan to hook these up to your handheld device and be pleased.Okay, now my review. This is an overall very comfortable headphone. The weight is good and they feel like a very well-built product. I returned them due to their lack of power. After listening to the 7506 from the same source, I realized just how weak these are.Don't Google &#34;MDR-V6 vs MDR-7506.&#34; You will spiral into a never-ending debate between people who are simply loyal to the original product (V6) vs people who say they are the same exact thing. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.Some claim the magnets in the 7506 are &#34;stronger,&#34; to which i cannot testify. The only thing i can say with certainty is that i heard subtleties from the 7506 that i did not hear with the V6.Audio quality of the V6:Low mids are strong, while the high mids are not crisp. Mid-lows sound quiet, while the really deep bass sounds as it should, but not strong. Highs sound strong throughout.Save your time and money and get the 7506 if you are debating between the 2.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V6 -- Good, but not as good as the 7506", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}
