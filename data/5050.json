It demonstrates the inadequacy of the several players I have - the best sound source seems to be had by playing CDs on a DVD player through a wide-screen LCD television. They also allowed me to hear previously inaudible features of heretofore familiar recordings. The players' breathing and scuffling in the quiet passages of a string quartet were clearly discernable (as they would be if the players were giving a private concert in my living room).I bought these primarily based on the reviews on amazon - so this one is only adding to the existing positive chorus. The sole design flaw seems to be the headband, that only touches the head at one point. They seem to be comfortable anyway, and to be fair, this is a traditional headphone design. The split headband with soft fabric surmounting the head, and a separate spring above, exemplified by the Bang and Olufsen Form 1, the RCA WHR 120, and others, may be more comfortable over long periods. However, recently in a local record store, I noticed that the headphones provided for customers to sample the records before purchase were this very model.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2014"}
