{"reviewerID": "A1NHV6PPZY45FD", "asin": "B00001WRSJ", "reviewerName": "Larry", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "After having my MDR-V6 headphones for six months I think I can finally give a review of them.PRO - Flat, accurate sound from low to high that gets smoother the more I use them.Reasonably light weight for their size.Generally well built except for the exposed wire leading to each earpiece.The low impedence allows me to use the V6 with my retro portable CD players (one of them only uses 1 AA battery) with good sound volume. No need at all for an amplifier.CON - When putting the headphones on, my fingers sometimes get caught in the exposed wires leading to each can. I've learned that when one of my fingers can't let go of the headphones after putting them on, to stop and gently pull whichever finger is caught out of the wire loop lest I rip the wire out of the can.The pleather earpads that come with the V6s tended to make my ears REALLY hot and sweaty in summer weather. I replaced them with a pair of Beyerdynamic Velour Padded Earcushions for the DT-250 from B&H; Photo. Big improvement in comfort and sound quality, especially comfort. The Beyerdynamic pads are cooler and more transparent to sound than the pleather pads that come with the V6s. I should have ordered the Beyerdynamic pads at the same time I ordered the V6 phones and replaced the original pads immediately. When i get my backup MDR-V6 I'm going to do just that.Summary - If your taste in sound tends towards flat, uncolored accuracy (as does mine) and you don't want to spend loads of $, then the MDR-V6 is the one. Bassheads probably should look elsewhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the $", "unixReviewTime": 1218844800, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2008"}
