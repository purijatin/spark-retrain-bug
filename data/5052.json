Their start , in the 1980's, began when they were picked as &#34;best buy&#34; in &#34;Consumer reports. They were also the best of the many tested as having the best sound at any price(at that time). They remain so , despite a few reviews ,even by audiophiles, who are reviewing their own hearing, or are playing to their client audience with advertising bias; they remain today among the 10 ten headphones at ANY price. My first pair lasted 17 years . I bought a new pair (surely they had deteriorated in sound) to place back in my headphone stable; This includes AKG 701 and Beyerdynamic DT-880 at present. The Sony's did not deteriorate in sound quality. Only the inexpensive ear pads are a nuisance, as they are on every brand that uses Pleather; Small Potatoes.Some confuse the clean extremely low bass, with exaggerated Bass. I call it &#34;Subwoofer bass in a headphone. You will not be disappointed or need to look any further folks ...one of the true bargains in Hi -Fi history.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best closed Headphones at ANY Price for decades.", "unixReviewTime": 1391904000, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2014"}
