Secondary is music listening (I am not a music buff).  Wear it for about  4 hours each time and it is still comfortable when I take it off.  I work in a very loud place (computer data center room) and this device drowns out the noise really well!  I will leave the &#34;how well the sound is delivered&#34;  out of my review as there are numerous other reviews that can convey that message much better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent at drowning out background noise for less than $100", "unixReviewTime": 1370131200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2013"}
