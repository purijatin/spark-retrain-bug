The pads started to fall apart about 3 years ago, but the sound is still good as new. In the past 5 years, I spent lots money on many mp3 players dvd players and many of them are broken or outdated now, but I kept using this phone so it was money well spent because it was used on daily base. I tried other phones which did not cost lots of money but were very good quality products like KOSS Sporta-pro, unlike the most MDR-V6 is a closed type phone which helps to block noise like running AC in a office. I compared it to a Senheiser HD-280, I liked  the sound of MDR-V6 more. In my opinion, MDR-V6 phone has a deeper yet clean bass, HD-280 blocks noise better but I prefer a better bass.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not a penny wasted.", "unixReviewTime": 1200614400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2008"}
