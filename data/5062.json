Alexander", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I initially bought two cheaper headphones(Panasonic RP-HT21 & JVC HA-RX300) believing that I would be wasting money if I bought a more expensive set.Boy was I wrong. I picked these up in the Black Friday Week of deals for 39.99 and could not believe what I was listening too. My Music Never Sounded this Good through my Mbd integrated audio before. The BASS was Clean, Accurate and Not Overpowering, The MIDS were Clear and the HIGHS were Crisp without being overly bright. The sound isolation is also pretty good.I'll admit at times it feels like a clamp on my head and I currently have it pulled down where I can see 5 notches on either side to fit. The Ear cups also might not fit around people with big ears but by no means are these small.The headphones come with a 3.5mm adapter, a leatherette carrying pouch and is equipped with a thick coiled cable.As good as these headphones are, I do not know how they will survive on the go (It Can be folded into a more \"portable\" size but they label them as a Studio Monitor headphone and they have wires that are exposed around the headband)If I knew they were this good, I would have bought more of them and sooner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth the Money Over a Cheaper Set", "unixReviewTime": 1354406400, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2012"}
