I'm a 22 yr old with a crazy obsession with sound and music. Audiophile? Maybe. These headphones are so perfect in every way. The sound is so crisp, clear and clean, the design is awesome and simple and the materials are very high quality. They are so comfortable even for my sensitive ears. The bass is just absolutely perfect, not choppy or muddy at all. Forget the Beats, forget the Souls by Ludacris, save yourself the money and get higher quality at half the price. There's no surprise that these have been so widely used for almost 30 years. The included adapter is perfect because it allows me to use these cans in my iPhone and home audio system which is also 100% Sony, I just love their audio hardware.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Look No Further!", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}
