But you can't beat the sound quality for the dollar in Sony headphones. I have the &#34;old version&#34; of these, loved them for the past 15 years. My hubby borrowed them, and wouldn't give them back! So I ordered these for him, hoping he'd switch (he did - YAY!).Before you order any of the &#34;celebrity-endorsed&#34; or other logo-related headphones, check the Hz. For the dollar, you won't beat these sweet phones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5Hz-30kHz - Find that today", "unixReviewTime": 1372896000, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2013"}
