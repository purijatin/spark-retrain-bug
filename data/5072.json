I have to adjust where they sit on my head cuz it really does hurt, I dont know why they push so hard against your head. I usually wear a hat when I listen to them because it delays them hurting for a while.Otherwise, they dont like like incredible quality.For the sound they are incredible. but I wouldnt get them again cuz they hurt so much.If you are looking for comfortable listening then these might not be the bestbut they sound good and block out a bunch of sound.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sound is so Crisp and detailed", "unixReviewTime": 1323129600, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2011"}
