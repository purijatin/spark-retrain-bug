Clark", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I bought my current pair of MDR-V6 phones about 25 years ago, and they still are the best sounding headphones I've heard, and they still sound as good as they did back then. To solidify my confidence in them over the years, any time I've seen any documentary or video of a rock group that showed any band members or engineers in the studio, they were always using the MDR-V6. If it's good enough for the pros, it's good enough for me. The amazing thing is that the price really hasn't changed much. I think I paid about $50 or $60 for mine. Anyway, I guarantee these headphones will not disappoint.By the way, I noticed that Amazon suggests a headphone plug adapter as a paired purchase with these. I don't know why they would do that. Unless Sony has changed something, these come with that. It has the standard (home stereo system) plug which unscrews to reveal the smaller (portable player) plug underneath it.I've read other reviews about Amazon pairing items that don't even go together. Don't assume you need it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones....period!", "unixReviewTime": 1172620800, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2007"}
