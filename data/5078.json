They could probably stand to have the styling upgraded though, as they look a little out of date compared to newer designs.4/29/13 Update:  Although I am still very happy with the sound of these headphones.  I am going to take off two stars because my earpads already wore out.  I've had these less than a year and use them very VERY lightly.  Although there are many replacement options available, wearing out in less than a year with the light use only that I've put on them is inexcusable.  Now I'm going to have to try and figure out Sony's warranty service, not something I'm looking forward to.  On the plus side, I've found these to be very good for the airplane - they really do block out a lot of outside noise.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1364256000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2013"}
