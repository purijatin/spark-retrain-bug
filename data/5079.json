When I first got them, I re-listened to my whole collection just so I could pick out all the bits I'd missed out on before. Blows away Beats and Bose and whatever other overpriced brands are out there. At first, these were a bit uncomfortable. I replaced the pads with some velour ones that I also bought from Amazon. Now, they are much more comfortable, and seem to be better at blocking out sound, both ways (good for when you want to listen in a quiet room). I think they look good too, they aren't bulky like some other models. Nowadays, after breaking them in and the velour pads, I will occasionally fall asleep in my bed with them on, and I don't mind keeping them from when I wake up to when I go to bed (I am a heavy music listener, if you can't tell)I mostly listen to metal and classical, but this plays just about anything really well. I do have to mention that these headphones reproduce music perfectly, which also means less bass compared to other phones (Beats) that intentionally inflate bass (which in my opinion distorts music that doesn't need it). If you have an equalizer on your audio player or computer, it's no big deal at all. When I listen to hip-hop or electronic music, sometimes I jack up the bass, and these headphones can put out a good thump.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Headphones I've Used", "unixReviewTime": 1355443200, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2012"}
