First off, this is a truly great pair of headphones in the $70-$120 range. They have a very flat frequency response which means the lows, mids and highs pretty much get equal billing. This is fine for me. Because they were made more for studio monitoring rather than casual listening, some might feel they are lacking at the low end, but I think they just represent the music more faithfully. If you need to adjust the bass up higher, then go for it. They can handle it, and much better than the MDR-V600's which produce boomy low quality bass. The low frequencies on these are much tighter and more defined. Middle frequencies on these are great as well. Little to no coloring, vocals come through great. Middle frequencies on the 600's are pretty awful. It's like someone turned the treble up to 11. I don't know how else to put it. The one criticism I have of these is the poor quality of the earpads. Not only do little black flakes of fake leather start to come off after moderate use, but they completely came apart at the inner seam on mine, exposing the foam inside. I know I'm not alone in experiencing this and quite frankly It's a little baffling why they have not addressed this issue in the 25+ years this model has been available. There are lots of options as far as replacement pads go, so despite that I would still highly recommend these on the basis of great sound quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are not the MDR-V600's, and that's a good thing.", "unixReviewTime": 1361059200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2013"}
