Oliver \"KT2T\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "First, the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful.  They are not boomy, but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs, and everything in between sounds equally as nice.  The cord coils nicely and doesn't tangle, entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other end.The \"funky mechanics\" that I refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband.  The headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones.  I also find myself being (overly?) careful when collapsing/expanding the headphones, but maybe that's just my paranoia considering the cost.The sound quality is without par in any headphones I have ever had and I would definitely buy another pair IF these don't fall apart mechanically within the next couple of years.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great sound, funky mechanics", "unixReviewTime": 1238976000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2009"}
