I think it's 10 to 15 less now.  They're worth $70 so if they've dropped in price then they're definitely worth it. Sound is good for digital stereo, but won't compare to a surround sound headphone. If all you need is stereo you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Descent sound for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1356739200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012"}
