I decided on this headhone after comparing it to the 280 Pro (v6's amplification, and suitability for all kinds of music). For someone who has never listened to high quality cups before, it took some getting used from the boom-box style sound I was accustomed to before. In the end, I bought the OzoneMP (iZotope) plugin for winamp to get the sound profile I liked. The v6 needed very little amplification compared to my previous maxell HP-2000 studio monitor headphones. I was able to pick up sounds I never new existed. Unfortunately, for someone who listens to 128Kbps mp3 a lot, this meant a lot of noise, pops and clicks in the music. This was mostly bearable when the music is in full swing, but stands out in the silent sections of the music or really poor quality recordings. The same would be bearable in the Maxell (but without clarity).The headphone tightness around the ear hurt a lot when used more than half hour. I salvaged the Velour-like ear pads from my previous maxell studio head phones which fit the sony like a baggy pant. But what a huge difference and relief to the ear. The headphones are still tight, but much more bearable. Its almost a must that you change the ear pads, and consider that in the true cost of these headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "excellent product; but poor quality mp3s will sound worse", "unixReviewTime": 1200355200, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2008"}
