More 'bassy' than my Grado SR60 headphones which are in the same price range.  However, these phones surround the entire ear which accounts for some of the additional bass whereas the Grado phones sit on the ear and allow for more \"soundstage\" and in my opinion more accurate sound.  The Sony phones shut out much more of the room noise than the Grado phones do because of their 'sealed' design.  The Grados don't shut out any room noise at all by comparison so if you listen in a noisy place you may want to go with these Sonys.  These phones are good for editing, DJs, microphone usage etc.  They are fairly comfortable.  Much more than the Sennheisers I tried on, not as much as the Grados.  However, I don't find any headphones \"comfortable\" really.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1178323200, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2007"}
