They do lack a bit in bass for my taste but I am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected. I did almost have to max out the volume on my mp3 player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier. All in all a good buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Headsetf or the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1252886400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2009"}
