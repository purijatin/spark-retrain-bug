I dont know the technicalities of sound performance but these headphones are **clear**; Even at a pretty loud volume.Pros:1. Really good build quality (metallic hinges and all). A welcome change after the V700's2. Smallest Circum-aural design out there.3. Pretty quiet.4. Very good Sound quality. I heard some lyrics & sound that didnt know existed even though I had been listening to the song for years!Cons:1. I read from previous reviews that these can be worn for a long time but i didnt find that to be the case (compared to the XD400's). Because of the minimalist circumaural design I wouldnt recommend this for folks with larger than normal ears2. High impedance and hence not the best for mp3 players. I had to bump up the volume of my iAudio by 50% to be able to listen to lyrics. However I am still only at about a third of the maximum and so its not all that bad.3. \"Telephone Type\" voice coil and hence heavy. I would have preferred a cord-type one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound & build, but not the best for mp3 players.", "unixReviewTime": 1205366400, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2008"}
