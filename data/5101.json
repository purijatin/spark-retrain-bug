Also the coiled cord is curiously heavy and the connector seems like it isn't seating properly as the left channel constantly produces a lot of crackling if you nudge the connector or pull on the cord at all.  Never had that problem before.  Sound and build quality of the Audio Technica ATH-M50 is certainly worth the extra cost.  They are reasonably comfortable, but every time I pull them out I feel like I'm going to accidentally destroy them as I fidget with getting the ear cups out from their folded position.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "sorry to say I'm returning them", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}
