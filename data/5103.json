The ear pads were $16 each to replace! No thank you!Judging by the other Sony MDR-V6 customer reviews and suggestions for better headphones (on Bose headphone reviews) I decided to order a pair. People saying their first pair lasted for 10 or 15 years is what I wanted to hear after owning several pairs of headphones that wore-out far too quickly.I've owned these headphones for almost a month now and couldn't be happier.Durability aside, the sound quality is great. I've had enough different pairs of headphones and home speakers to be able to judge sound quality. The MDR-V6 aren't dramatically better than my old Panasonic headphones but they do have noticeably richer overall sound and better bass. I enjoy balanced sound  for my wide taste in music and these headphones are great for anything I've listened to with them.Happy customer here.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love These!", "unixReviewTime": 1198713600, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2007"}
