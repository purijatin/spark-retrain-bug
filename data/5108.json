I think i can repair it with tape on mine but this is a design problem for those who, like me, didn't realize they were cutting the sound wire over time..  a short year.  Just make sure the wire isn't going between the bracket and phone each time you put them on and it'll be fine..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "only one serious problem", "unixReviewTime": 1272499200, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2010"}
