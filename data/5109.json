I was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my 7506s, I did not feel alienated with the V6 headphones.  If I had $350 to spend on headphones, I would still get these any day of the week.  Rich bass, excellent vocals, and pristine clear sound overall.  Anyone who works radio, podcasts, or records music will want these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Forget the Dre Beats, get these", "unixReviewTime": 1355702400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2012"}
