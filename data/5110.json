For the expenditure these are very hard to beat. The tonal balance is nearly perfect, with perhaps a slight boost in the bass region. They are easy to drive, so even a smart phone gives decent sound. However, with a dedicated amp, they are incredible. I strongly recommend these, even if they have a coiled cord. In fact, I am buying two more sets to use as gifts.Well, it is time for an update on these headphones. The sound quality is still great. However, I started having an intermittent problem with the right side not having any sound. The problem progressively got worse and now, there is no sound from the right side at all. This occurred after relatively little use. I have not decided whether to attempt to repair them, or simply buy a new pair. I am removing one star from my review for this problem.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very, very hard to beat for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1320105600, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2011"}
