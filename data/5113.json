Think slippers for your ears. You can almost forget you are wearing them. The second is the total lack of the enclosed sound most headphones have to some degree. This means you can also forget that you are listening through headphones. The third is their startling clarity. You don't have to strain to make out sounds. The overall effect is that the designers of the MDR V6s have effectively removed the headphones from the listening experience. This in itself is a phenomenal achievement. You should have these headphones if only to experience this level of performance.But are they sonically perfect? Well no, not really. The low bass can sometimes sound a bit punchy and thereby be a distraction. The soundstage often does not extend much beyond your head. They are not euphonic headphones  which will mask poor material with a big midbass hump  (this is a good thing, actually). And they sometimes seem a little thin in the lower midrange so that voices might not sound as rich as you might like. But given the way these phones present the sound, they  need make no apologies. They produce a clean, uncolored and wide range sound. No wonder people use them for so long.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect Transducer?", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2013"}
