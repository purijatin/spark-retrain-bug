Alexander", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "Well, I can't praise these headphones enough, they sound amazing on the average computer, with nothing but a headphone output, and they shine like the sun through an amp and equalizer. They even work very well with the Ipod touch, which can tend to be underpowered for larger diaphragm headphones such as these, but once again, they didn't fail to perform. The voice coil is perfect for being able to keep things neat while sitting at a desk, but still being able to have your headphones on, and run over to the shelf, or even stretch them to a close-by room, not kidding! I just cannot get over the sound quality for such an inexpensive set of headphones. My only gripe is that within the first couple months, I've had to have the ear cups replaced by Sony (free of charge) and multiple people seem to have this problem. I bought a pair of Beyerdynamic cups:Beyerdynamic Velour Earcushions MDR7506 HeadphonesAnd they seem like they will last. Otherwise, the metal frame, and chamber are impressive, and the hefty cord and ends seem like they'll last a good long time. Although they're a little chunky/old fashioned to bring in public for some people, I don't have much of a problem with the design. It's very comfortable for long periods of wear as well.EDIT:These were purchased April 3rd of 2012, and the right earcup has stopped working as of September 14th 2013, they served me QUITE WELL indeed for the time I've had them but this is really unacceptable, especially considering all of the amazing reviews I've read for how long other customers have had these for. Has the quality of construction gone down? I'll try to update my review as for the experience of RMA'ing them or getting them repaired, and how much it costs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1339718400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2012"}
