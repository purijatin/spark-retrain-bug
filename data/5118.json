So far, this V6 by SONY sounds the best.Everybody has different hearing, music taste & also different Audio equipment. So, the sound quality you prefer to getis a personal preference & not just depend on the specific brand or model of headphone or speaker. It's a try & choose game.The SONY MDR-V6 is very comfortable on your head & over your ears, Nice reproduction of high & low frequencies (5Hz-30000)It has excellent deep clean BASS (I listen to all kinds of \"Good\" music from Alternative to Trance).It definitely sound better than my Sennheiser HD-280 Pro (which is heavier)... Still good one though.... plug it in -> hit Play -> You will fall in love ! &lt;-(((( BUY IT ))))", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tunes to the Bones !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1279756800, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2010"}
