It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Rock and current pop, less so for classical", "unixReviewTime": 1387152000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2013"}
