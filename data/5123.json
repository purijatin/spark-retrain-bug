Music just sounds better and I was very much surprised.  I'm not an audiophile, I am a regular consumer.  I've used $200+ earbuds and they don't compare imo to what you can get through headphones.  The only negative I can think of is that the padding can get warm if worn for a long time.  I bought a replacement earpads (non Sony) and now it's perfect.  I use to study because it can be noisy outside of my room.I would buy this if you're getting your feet wet and want the best for sub $100 headphones.I wouldn't buy this if you care what this might do to your hair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1287532800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2010"}
