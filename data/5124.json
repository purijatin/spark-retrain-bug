Do not overlook the 'fatiguing' that is mentioned, these are definitely high in that category.  I find myself keeping them half on / half off my ears a lot of the time to avoid fatiguing and also to be able to hear my surroundings (I was fully aware of this when purchasing).  But for hard core listening, these are perfect and very fun.Also, the tightness that was mentioned is noticeable.  As mentioned, I wear these properly about half the time.  If not worn properly (one ear off/one on, or letting the headphones set higher on the head so you can hear your surroundings), I noticed pressure.  You just have to wear them in.. or stretch them a bit and they are perfect.I bought these headphones for quality sound... and it delivers.  I would not rate this lower under any circumstances.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1323043200, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2011"}
