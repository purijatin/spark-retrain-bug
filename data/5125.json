No need for burning in!!!  I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50, and Monster Beats Studio.  These Sony MDR-V6 blow em both away.  The ATH-M50s tend to be a bit flat, the Beats a bit bass heavy.  These MDR-V6s are dynamic and LIVELY along all parts of the spectrum.  I'm hearing notes, bravados, instrument fades, break-beats that I haven't heard before.  As I am writing this, I've only on hour 2 of listening.  I'm using my 5G iPod Nano w/o an amp (imagine with a headphone amp!).  Seriously, you won't be disappointed in these.  Very comfortable, quality construction.  Buy one now, the price is right, its worth 3x the price in all seriousness.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Owner for 1 day", "unixReviewTime": 1316304000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2011"}
