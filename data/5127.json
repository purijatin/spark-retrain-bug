One of them for my SO and she pinched the wire in a drawer on the desk and one of the speakers was no longer getting audio. In her work she does board level repair on everything from laptops, smart phones, and desktops, but regardless was not able to fix the issue with a soldiering iron. The wire is mostly rubber, the metal they use is extremely thin, which is probably why it broke so easily in the first place.My headphones still work, but the ear pads are completely worn out. I realize I can buy new pads, but I shouldn't have to.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Very thin wire easily breaks.", "unixReviewTime": 1384646400, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2013"}
