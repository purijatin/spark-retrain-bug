Purchased for $99 back in 1990 and that was big bucks for a engineering college Freshman. I loved hifi and dorms were not the placed to drag your equipment. They drowned out the background noise and kept me studying away. I now use them to drown out my children when I telecommute.The sound quality is incredible and the comfort level 2nd to none. I sometimes felt odd traveling on planes wearing them on air planes etc but this style has come around.Mine the pad has flaked off.I hope the new ones hold up the same, mine have a rarity now: \"Made in Japan\".Highly recommend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible Sound, I purchased mine in 1990", "unixReviewTime": 1313020800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2011"}
