These reproduce amazingly clean, clear, accurate sound. Best headphone till date. I own many in ear, on-ear and over the ear headphones which includes some etymotic, sennheiser, sony, creative, panasonic RP-HTF600-S, klipsch image one, brainwavz models and listened to many $100+ models at apple store and best buy. Sony MDR-V6 is the best till date. These are not tuned to produce artificial booming bass at the cost of mids and highs. Buy them without any hesitation and thank me later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best over the ear headphone under $100", "unixReviewTime": 1349913600, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2012"}
