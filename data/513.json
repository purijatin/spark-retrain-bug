I was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that I will love ebook reader. What I love about Nook that I can change size of letters on ANY e books. For exemple. I download e book PD format I made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints SO small its impossible to read.  On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store. But not e book you made by yourself. I could not find Russian e book on Kindle store i would love to read . So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "i love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1341273600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2012"}
