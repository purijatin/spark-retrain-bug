You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Godly Sound - This is what you need for a quality listening experience.", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2011"}
