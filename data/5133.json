I plug them directly into my Access Virus KC or Minibrute or UltraNova or any one of my several instruments and they make me smile. I hear what I play exactly as it sounds on my studio near field monitors. The highs, midrange and base sound perfect. The center feels exactly correct and the instruments seem placed exactly where they should be as do the vocals. Sometimes I think that the V6's are surround sound they are that good.I've tried other brands and other Sony's as well but for this price I'm getting a $200-esque pair of cans. I saw them for $300 on another site. Really? That's too much, but 10 years ago I paid $129 for them and now they're $76 on Amazon. If you mix music, DJ, or just like listening to music then these are for you. I'm glad that Sony still makes them. My second pair still sounds great but they're a little ratty for wear. I've replaced the ear pads twice and the headpad is completely wrapped in duct tape and I lost the carrying bag that came with it. So, this time I decided to get a new pair just in case Sony stops making them.There are better cans out there, to be sure, but they cost a lot more. I read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they'd found a $40 pair of 'phones that were just as good but ... that's right, they started to list a series of buts like the competetion was a little less comfortable, too light or too tight or felt too fragile or the highs were slightly tinny, or weak mids or the bass bottomed out. Well, none of that for the V6's. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "3rd pair in 15 years! Quality for sure!", "unixReviewTime": 1347580800, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2012"}
