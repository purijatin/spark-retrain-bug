These have Samarium Cobalt magnets and the response has more of a smiley face to fool you into not noticing the roll off on both ends.  The 7506, with Neodymium magnets, has a flatter midrange but the lack of extension is more noticeable.  To repeat: both headphones lack extension, but one doesn't try to hide it and the other does.  Some people find the 7506 brighter overall.  Two different flavors of otherwise the exact same housing & driver design.  The nickel or gold-plated jack has no real world difference.  You might get a little more corrosion on the former, but the latter will just wear eventually anyway.  Samarium Cobalt and Neodymium both have their benefits.  Neodymium is stronger and doesn't significantly lose any of that strength over time (the sound might be more stable), but Samarium Cobalt puts out a more even magnetic field and is more heat resistant.  The fact that the weaker magnet on the V6 is preferred by some people might mean the \"aging\" of the magnet may have something to do with the tone people rave about on their 20 year old set.  Neither model has outstanding bass response or distortion characteristics.
