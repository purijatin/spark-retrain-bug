I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great inexpensive headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1323302400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2011"}
