The digital music era was becoming the norm back then and these made CDs sound really good compared to other headphones that were available at the time.  Since 1991 I have replaced the ear pads twice but the sound quality is just as impressive today.  Their response is flat allowing you to hear every small nuance in your music even at low volumes.  The comfort level is good, I have no issues when wearing them for extended periods of time.  When I got these it was not a purchased I thought through completely (impulse buy), I never imagined they would hold up as well as they have for so long and, more importantly, sustain their sound quality as they continue to.  No regrets from this very satisfied owner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "22 years and still going strong", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013"}
