It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great no-frills eBook reader", "unixReviewTime": 1313971200, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2011"}
