I also have a medium to large head, and they are comfortable. i have not had any issues with the stock pads making my ears sore. They also cup the ears nicely so they cut out a good amount of outside noise. These are totally worth the $75 or so I paid for them. The sound is comparable to headphones double the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound reproduction", "unixReviewTime": 1373155200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2013"}
