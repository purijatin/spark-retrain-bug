For my full thoughts on the 7506, click the link above and look for that review.The two models are virtually identical. The V6 phones were originally released as a high end headphone to appeal to audiophiles who were on a budget. They feature closed ear design with soft lamb skin ear pads, smooth frequency response, and a bass boost popular with DJs and contemporary music lovers.The main differences between the two are that the 7506 phones come with gold tipped plugs and a sticker that says Professional on it. The V6 has a sticker that says simply Digital and the plugs are standard silver.And the MDR-V6 phones are usually about $30.00 cheaper than their professional model. All in all, either model will sound great for whatever purpose you choose to use them for. Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still The Industry Standard After 20 Years", "unixReviewTime": 1228867200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2008"}
