Mehan", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "The Sony MDR-V6 is a terrific headphone at a great price-point--I think it's a great compromise between comfort and sound.  I've used them as a professional video sound recorded and for my personal music and sound editing purposes.  They are rugged--one of my pet peeves is the ear pads fall off headphones and the MDR-V6 doesn't have a problem with this. They are compact and light, but still have great sound.  My musician friend says they're a recording standard--don't know if this is a fact, but I could believe it.  Highly recommended--", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1350950400, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2012"}
