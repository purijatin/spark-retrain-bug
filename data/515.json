The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this Nook", "unixReviewTime": 1309996800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2011"}
