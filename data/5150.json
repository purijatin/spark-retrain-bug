These upgraded a similar style (circum-aural) of $25 headphones. I thought my old headphones were good but these new Sonys are fantastic. At 106 dB/mW sensitivity, the 40mm driver provides ample sound volume. The ear cuffs isolate outside noise well.Pros:- Linear frequency response. Bass through treble sound vivid, balanced.- Solid construction. Metal headband, many screws- Comfortable to wear.- Flexible \"telephone\" cord is a plus.- Came with large stereo jack adaptor.- Folds compactly in (faux?) leather draw-string bag.Cons:- My old phones had a manual slide volume adjustment on the cord, the Sony doesn't.- The headband musses up my hair.I'm quite satisfied with these headpones for their sensitive, expressive, accurate, efficient sound reproduction.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excites my ears", "unixReviewTime": 1171497600, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2007"}
