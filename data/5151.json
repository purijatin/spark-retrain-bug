Stephen Franks", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I wanted to retire my MDR-V600s to my computer and get the studio monitor v6s for the hi-fi. I was a bit put off by the highs at first until i turned off my hi-fi's equalizer. Going flat and uncolored, these headphones are superb. I love them. They are smaller, lighter than the v600s and sound better to boot.Surprisingly, my mother insisted on my ordering a pair for her as well! The fit and sound appealed to her for playing the organ with headphones, or listening to music CDs.I highly recommend these headphones, especially at this price point.----------------------------A Return to My Original Review:It is May 2014 and I have had these cans for a spell. The longer I own my Sony studio monitors, the more I adore them! There is nothing like a flat and uncolored pair of monitor headphones for pure musical enjoyment as music is meant to be heard.  But don't let that lull you into thinking these phones lack power, beefy low notes, or lack a wonderful subtlety in the solidity of the low end. The fact is, cranked up they will make your ears bleed! Their power requirement is also low that I have even used them on an antique radio who's volume is not much louder than a crystal radio.I still highly recommend these headphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More than meets my expectations!", "unixReviewTime": 1390953600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014"}
