The ear pads are pretty close to needing to be replaced (which wont be expensive at all), but other than that these are as good as the day I bought them. I'm no audiophile- the sound is very good, but what I love is the comfort. I wear these for upwards of seven hours a day and they are fantastically cushy. The only con I have is that the chord is very long and heavy with the coils, so it hangs off of my computer desk and I can *just* feel the weight of it especially when I move my head. My next pair will be wireless, and probably noise canceling so I don't have to listen to my idiot roommate talk to his gamer friends.One of my favorite possessions.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still going strong after two years.", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}
