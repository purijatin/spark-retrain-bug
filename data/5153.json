It seems Sony did something right 20-30 years ago and hasn't strayed from the formula since. This set looks good, fits well, and sounds great. They definitely need a few hours to loosen up to get their best sound, but it's worth it. I feel like I hear everything when I'm listening to music. They block out outside sound well enough for me.The cups are comfortable and large enough for my ears. They are highly durable; I'm not afraid to throw them around a little bit, or even stuff them into my backpack. The coiled cord can get heavy at times. I wish it was more of a flat cord and had a cord wrangler like my old Sennheiser HD202s (a good low-end set), but if it helps it sound they way it does I'm more than okay with it.There is the higher-end-marketed Sony MDR7506 but these are basically the same. Some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets' response patterns, but it's hardly noticeable. The only real difference is that the 7506 has a gold-tipped jack whereas the V6 does not. One reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly (I.e. NOT installed in a studio setting) the gold plating could eventually wear off. As I take my set on the go and plug into various devices, this was fine with me.You cannot find a better set of headphones for under $100. I would recommend these to anybody that likes music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
