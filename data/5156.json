Only had them a week but I've already realized what I've been missing.  The only issue I had was that on the iMac, there was no easy way of switching between built in speakers and headphones when the headphones were plugged into the headphone jack.  Solution was to get a USB adapter (from an old pair of logitechs) and now I can easily switch by a single click on the menu bar.  Highly recommended, and I'm seriously considering a second pair to use in work.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great", "unixReviewTime": 1318377600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2011"}
