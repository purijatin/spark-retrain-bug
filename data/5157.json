My intention was to use for monitoring in the recording studio and for silent bass guitar practice.  I noticed that the TV studio where I work used Sony 7506's.  I discovered that the MDR-V6 are nearly identical.  I ordered them and A-B them with the 7506 only to discover that I could not tell the difference.  Both were excellent.Which brings me to audio quality.  They are sonically invisible.  I put them on and suddenly, by the resonance of the kick drum, I can hear the shape of the room Bonnie Raitt's drummer was in when he recorded I Will Not Be Broken.  These headphones are full, flat, uncolored and clear.  They're perfect for what I want--to hear as faithfully as possible.I have owned these headphones for just over a year and I've used them almost every day.  No wear or mechanical problems to report.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "full range and uncolored", "unixReviewTime": 1353456000, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2012"}
