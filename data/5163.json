Joke aside, these are wonderful and clear as day when listening to any form of music by Headhunterz(bass/kick) or the Eagles(epic crisp guitar). No need to get expensive headphone into the hundreds when these are right here. I have worked with a few friends of mine in the Norway/east Europe techno circuit and these are the on the go top rated headphones for when the melody starts nocking in your head and you need to get it into the computer as fast as you can with as much clarity as you can. Personally I would rate these from home hobby to professional produces(as a travel or monitoring aspect) and leave the real high ends for live studio(over $150k-1m). So in short, you get these and your mix comes alive with terrible sounds that your old headphones missed...which in the by the end of the day will sound crisp and colorful thanks to Sony's MDR-V6s.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "From home to million dollar studio, you can't go wrong with these! Crisp and clear!", "unixReviewTime": 1386374400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2013"}
