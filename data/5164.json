I have a set of Bose headphones with which I listen mostly to music when working at my desk/computer and a Sony MDRV6 (mainly for when I am watching TV) that I have had for nearly 7 years and it is still going strong; that is why I purchased this second set - and the price was too attractive to ignore.Throughout the years I could not tell any difference in sound quality or clarity; and since rap music is not to my musical taste, I have no issue with the \"bass\" notes as stated by other reviewers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Built to last.
