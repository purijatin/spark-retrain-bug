I did alot of research and admittidly, these did not have the most universally poitive reviews in the sub-$100 bracket. I have a big head and these feel like a feather on me. Especially compared to my Logitech G-35 gamers. Which are not comfortable at all. The sound on these are clear and crisp. There on my head now and I actually had forgotten for a few minutes. My biggest concern was they would hurt and they dont at all. I love the cord. The fold up feature is nice and they sit compact on my desk (unlike the G-35's). I have not tried any other \"cans\" so my experience is obviously limited and the group has some other highly rated headphones. The grado sr-60/80; AT ad700; and the 555's all get good reviews. Good luck chosing if you have to. These are very nice imo.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are nice", "unixReviewTime": 1291334400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010"}
