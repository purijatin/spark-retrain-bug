Turner, IV \"Pathologically Unwill...", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "These are so much better than headset in their price range, they are a no-brainer. If you're a Beatz from Dre fan, obviously you don't really care about sound quality, so keep on moving. The reason the normals want these is because we're looking for great quality sound, under $100, that won't leak all over the room.The build quality is exemplary. There is metal all over this thing. When you compare it to the plastic stuff out there, they feel like toys. These are passive noise cancelling, but are super comfy and just completely seal you away from the world.I thought they were too big, and wanted to send them back. I tried to replace them with other headsets and eventually saw why there are 600+ reviews, mostly positive.Just buy them, even to test the hype. You're probably going to be underwhelmed at first. Then compare them with all the other headphones in the price range you think will be better. You'll keep these, and probably add your own positive review.It's nice to know they are durable and will last a very long time. I love these things, full stop.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I didn't love them at first, then I tried to replace them.", "unixReviewTime": 1335916800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012"}
