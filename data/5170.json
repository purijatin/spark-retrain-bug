These headphones are an excellent choice for the price. Comfortable fit, brilliant highs, booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking. Even with no input I have to take them off to have a conversation. Overall - just another really great product from Sony. You can get much better cans than these, but not at this price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sony delivers at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 1347494400, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2012"}
