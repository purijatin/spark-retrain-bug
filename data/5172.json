I am not an audiophile, nor will I act like an expert in sound quality, but I am very pleased with these headphones.  I have been plodding along with some old Koss headphones on my gaming rig, and they were clearly at the end of their long life.  I have a nice little 5.1 surround setup for my computer to play games with, but when the wife goes to bed, I have to plug in the ear cans.  Going from all of the glorious booms and rumbles I get with the sub attached to my 5.1 system to the lack luster sound of my old headphones was jarring.  Well I can say that this is no longer a problem with these Sony headphones.  These produce a full range of sound that makes me forget I am wearing headphones instead of listening to my full speaker set.  Not overpowering on the low end, and not too tinty on the high.  As for the comfort on the head, some have said they dislike them, but I have no complaints.  I wear glasses, which can be problematic for extended periods of time with some headphones, but so far, these don't bother me at all, even after 3-4 hours of continuous wear.  If anything, the only problem I have with these, is that they block out the sound so well around me, that I can't hear when my wife comes into the room.  She was trying to talk to me the other night, and I had no idea she was speaking, which may get me in trouble one of these days.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for gaming", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}
