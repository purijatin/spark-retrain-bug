They are very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them. They are also very efficient (doesn't take a lot of power to drive them). I bought the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour ear cushions to put on them, and did they make a difference. Very comfortable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best sound for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2013"}
