I can't think of one other piece of electronics that I still own and use.  The bass on these are so phenomenal, but it's not overpowering.  You hear every piece of every piece of music.  Highs are also excellent.  These are the one thing that sounded better than my ex-speakers (Klipsch KG-4's).  The only thing I have replaced is the ear coverings, themselves.  Otherwise, just as perfect as ever and very comfortable, to boot.  You'll love them if you buy them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still haven't heard better", "unixReviewTime": 1372809600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2013"}
