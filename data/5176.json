I tried them with my iphone 3 and they sounded good. But, when I lost my iphone, I used my 30GB Zune player that I got from my daughter as she got an Ipod and then I turned on the EQ setting. Man, I heard sounds I never heard before from a stereo or headphones!!  The bass was awesome and I could hear the words much better!! Words I never knew what the singer was singing!!  So folks, it depends on your player for some awesome sounding bass.  I'm not sure if there is EQ app for iphone, but I will check when I get my replacement in a couple of months or some other phone if there is an EQ on the phone (doubt it, though may be surprised).  There ear pad on my left ear hurt a little at first after a little while but I adjusted the head band so it took most of the weight on top of my head and that worked.  Good luck in finding your headphones!  I found my babe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Baby!", "unixReviewTime": 1363996800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2013"}
