I was told to look for the greatest frequency response on the market.  These headphones have a frequency response of 5 Hz - 30 kHz.  I found that I could have gotten a lower rated Hz, but at a cost of over $200.  That was not an acceptable price for my budget.These headphones are very comfortable, reasonably priced, have a longer cord than absolutely necessary, have adapters for different size plugs, and outstanding quality of sound.  What more do you want?  ;o)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Headphones for the Money", "unixReviewTime": 1361059200, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2013"}
