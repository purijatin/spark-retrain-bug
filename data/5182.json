I was never happy with the V600s and now 20 years later just replaced them with the MDR-V6. Right out of the box...instant clarity, deep accurate bass, an articulate musical sound. Not sure what the V6 has that makes it so good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yep...these are magic!", "unixReviewTime": 1340150400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012"}
