I hear sounds that require good speakers to deliver on this headset, the treble is very clear, human voice is beautifully reproduced; on THX movies the imaging is very impressive ... However, there is very little bass in it. It rated as 10 HZ to 30MHZ, I don't know how sony comes up with the low frequency rating, that is lower than most 12'' sub woofer can deliver.  I doubt it can go lower than 80 HZ and you have to look for it. This headphone has the characteristic of electrostatic speakers, clear treble and lack of full audio body,  it is suitable for light jazz or the like but not much elsewhere.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Where is the Bass?", "unixReviewTime": 1145059200, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2006"}
