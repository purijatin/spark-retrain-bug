Hodgson", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "* Comfort:* Ear cups are very comfortable and don't make my ears or head ache after hours of use* Headband is flexible and doesn't hurt my head in any way.  Other reviewers complained of these being uncomfortable and too tight, but I have not experienced this at all.  My head is large, btw.* A-plus on comfort* Cord* Long and coiled* Thick and durable* A bit bulky for desktop computer or phone use* Connector* Thick and solid all metal design* Sound* Outstanding!  Best I've ever heard* Deep bass* Music is rich and beautiful* Podcasts are so clear, it's like being in the studio* Compared to other headphones: Because of the range, I've noticed that I must turn down the volume on these when doing comparisons.* I'm not an audiophile, but these headphones are making me a more discerning listener.* Storage/Profile* Lightweight for carrying* Folds up nicely for travel* Sound Cancelling* Some sound leaks in, but these generally block outside noise to an acceptable degree* Sound does not easily leak out* Other thoughts* I use headphones daily and wear them out with constant use.  After years of inferior headphones, I decided to give these a try and spend more money for the quality.  I'm expecting a lot.  So far so good.* I have a pair of dr-bt50 Bluetooth headphones and because of my positive experience with them, I decided to give these a try.  So far I am not disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best in class!  Another great Sony product", "unixReviewTime": 1374969600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2013"}
