Green \"meateebon\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I've been using various Sony headphones throughout my 27 years on this planet, and have always been more than happy with them, but I've always just stuck with the cheaper models. Recently, I decided to buy some new headphones. I tried out some other brands, such as Sennheiser, but in the end I decided to come home to Sony.This is the first time I've bought a pair of headphones in this price range, and all I can say is, I wish I had spent the money on these years ago! I had no idea what I was missing! The sound is very smooth yet precise, the bass response is just right and the highs are not overly bright (like the Sennheisers I tried).I've generally never cared for over-the-ear cans (most ones I've tried either squeezed my head or irritated my ears), but these are super comfortable. I've been wearing them all day (in fact I'm listening to them right now), and although my ears are a tiny bit sweaty after wearing them all day, they are still perfectly comfortable.For those of you that are on the fence about stepping up to the $60+ price range, I would say you absolutely need to get these. They are worth every penny.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My life is now complete (sonically, anyway)", "unixReviewTime": 1236643200, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2009"}
