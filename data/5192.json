These phones sound great.  I feel like I am there in GayFM's club.  I'm not gay but that's none of anyone's business anyway!  The headphones come with a built in 1/8 jack and a comes with a 1/4 adapter.  The coiled cable is great and stays out of the way.  So far comfort is ok, a little snub but not uncomfortable.  I have big ears and the cup seals fit around my whole ear.  I haven't worn them for longer than an hour so I can't say about comfort longevity.  The bass is surprisingly full and highs are crisp.  I like a thick bass sound and I sampled one of iTunes' 320kbps electronica radio channels.  The bass sounds incredible through these.  The earcups flip over 180 in case you need to use them like a DJ.  I never owned a fancy set of phones before so I can't really make any comparisons.  I like to think I have a pretty distinguishing ear and my ear likes the sound from these headphones.  You get a great sound for the price.  I had the studio MDR7506 model in my wish list for about a year then saw these at a discount price so I went ahead and got them.  The wider freq range sold me (I don't know about audio features but sounded reasonable to me wider is better).  I haven't had a chance to try each side by side so I hope I made the right choice in going cheaper.  So far, I am satisfied until I hear a better sounding model.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value for price", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2013"}
