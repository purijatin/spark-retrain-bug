Being a long time believer in Sony headphones and a long time user of the now retired V700's I knew I was going to get a quality product. These headphones have surpassed my expectations, they are light, very comfortable and the near field sound is perfect for a alt. production reference. These headphones are worth $109 every day of the week and if you catch them on sale like I did, you win even more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Can't go wrong.", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}
