I remember being a pre-teen at the time and thinking they were the best sounding headphones (or speaker for that matter) that I'd ever heard at the time.  My dad still has his and I actually picked up a pair of replacement pads as his had long disintegrated.  Found the pads for real cheap on a website mentioned in one of these reviews.  His sounds just as good as they did new 20+ years ago.  I grabbed these for an awesome Black Friday price.  These sound incredible, such detail with just the right level of bass (for me anyway).  Now if you're in to xtreme bass, you'll probably want to look for something that's marketed in that direction as these are not over the top.Comfort wise, they get a little warm on the ears after a while but they're enclosed over your ears so what headphones wouldn't?  As far as fitting too tight, blame that on your mother and father for giving birth to someone with too big of a head.  These are very comfortable and I can easily go a couple hours at a time in these.Beautiful sounds on instrumental, rock, techno, classical...anything really.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Incredible", "unixReviewTime": 1356998400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2013"}
