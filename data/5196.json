Tom", "helpful": [7, 14], "reviewtext": "These are okay headphones for the money but the earpads are totally faulty; they don't last very long, which is really annoying. I had to replace them at least once a year, at additional cost and frustration because they split open. While you can buy replacement ear pads it is really a pain to install them. Sony simply needs to make more durable ear pads.  The other thing is that they cook your ears. After a while wearing these, your ears start to feel really hot. The ear pads also press against your ears so they start hurting after wearing these for a while. These are not made for long listening periods unfortunately.These headphones look cool and provide fairly good isolation and good sound quality over the entire frequency range. They are the same as the more expensive MDR-7506 models except these don't say \"Professional\" on them and have less of a warranty.For the price, these headphones are fairly comfortable (but not the most comfy headphones available), and they sound pretty good although I've certainly heard better. There is little to no sound leakage and they provide good isolation in a foldable design that looks cooler than most other headphones. I would say these are good entry-level monitoring headphones (for audio engineers, DJs, etc.). For music lovers, they are certainly usable but you won't get that 'tickle me ears' type of 'Wow!' feeling from the sound out of them like with some other higher end headphones.If it wasn't for the truly faulty ear pads, I would give these a higher rating.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Faulty ear pads make these annoying", "unixReviewTime": 1247961600, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2009"}
