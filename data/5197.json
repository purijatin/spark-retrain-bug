Vo \"accoladephoto\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "These are very comfortable headphones and have a nice long cord to wrap around your work area.  As for the sound, the highs are great but the mids seem muffled and the bass is lacking the a deep sound that I prefer in the house/reggae/dance music that I listen to.  Also you will find your ears getting a little sweaty after prolonged use with any over the year headphone.  Overall a great pair of headphones but definitely not the amazing set I was hoping for after reading all these other positive reviews.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice & comfy but lacking bass", "unixReviewTime": 1380240000, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2013"}
