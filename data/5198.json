This was my first circum-aural set of headphones and the fit was much better for longer uses than any of the other. The bass surprised me at first with how distinct it was; probably as good as any desktop speakers I've had. The cord is long, so I can move around my desk a bit with pulling on the plug. And, of course, the sound quality is great. The fact the padding goes around the ear and sits on the head also gives it implicit noise reduction, so you can get a lot more out of whatever you're listening to without having to jack up the volume. Overall I was very impressed by these headphones and would highly recommend them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Headphones Yet", "unixReviewTime": 1323734400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2011"}
