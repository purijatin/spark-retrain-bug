These are great phones for the price!  Very light, good reproductions, comfortable to wear.  The headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the V600 but good enough.  I'm sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency, but for my money these are the BEST in their price range.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great phones for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1170460800, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2007"}
