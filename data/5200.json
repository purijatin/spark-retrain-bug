Wong", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I'm no audiophile but I have to say that these are easily the best pair of headphones I have ever had. At first I thought they were OK but then I read that you have to wear them in so I just played music that had heavy bass and distortion for a little while. Not sure if that's the way to break them in but it worked. After that, it's been smooth sailing.I do have to agree that the earphones do get a bit tiring to wear after a while. One can easily switch them out but I don't care that much since I only wear them a couple of hours a day.As for the music itself, it is very very clear. I can hear things I have never heard before. The bass is actually thumping, each guitar chord is heard, and minute noises are distinct. Great set of headphones and I would totally invest in another pair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love them", "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012"}
