I purchased these in 2009 and have not regretted my decision once. I like these headphones so much that whenever a friend or coworker is looking for a new pair of headphones, I immediately recommend these ones. I think 3 of my fiends have also purchased them after trying them. I even had a friend exchange his Beats for these.What I like:-Great sound profile, with just the right amount of base-Comfortable: I can wear these for hours without having to take them off or adjust them-Long, coiled cord: Because of the coil design it is only a couple of feet long, which makes it manageable. If you need it longer it easily stretches (but not strains) to several more feet.-Comes with an adapter: This comes in handy when I need to plug them into my receiver-Because of the over the ear design of the headphones, they block out sound nicely. I can use them on an airplane without having to crank up the volume and or losing quality because of the ambient noise. They also do a good job blocking out ambient noise in coffee shops and long road trips in the car.What I don't like:- Maybe a little bulky to wear in public, but that hasn't stopped me from using it on mass transit.Buy them, you will not be disappointed!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The only headphones that you will ever need", "unixReviewTime": 1374364800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2013"}
