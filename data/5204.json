I work as digital artist, so these headphones are being used 30 hours a week for the past 13 years.  They still work as good as the day I got them.  I have dropped these headphones countless of times and there is little to no damage.  The only thing I had to replace is the earpiece as they become flaky after years of use.  I would recommend these to any who wants a great set of headphones and don't want to pay overrated high price for some others.  There must be a reason why people are still buying the MDR-V6 that have not been discontinued yet.  Really a great set of headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best headphones ever!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1366934400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2013"}
