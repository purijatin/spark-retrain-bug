These are very comfortable and the sound is pretty good as well.  The physical quality of these headphones are very good as well.  I use these all the time.  The black material covering the foam ear pads is starting to tear at the base of the speakers.  I will have to buy replacement foam pieces in the future but the tear has not propagated so I think they should last a while longer.  My ears do get hot after wearing them for awhile but that just shows a good seal around the ears I suppose.  I would recommend these headphones even though they seem to be a little high in price perhaps given how long these headphones have been around.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great headphones.
