I am so paranoid that one day Sony will cease their production I've purchased several pairs so I'll have them up until I die. It's a testament to their quality that sports broadcasters, music producers, djs, and other professionals needing optimum sound quality continue to use these. What impresses me the most is the bass reproduction and high end timbres. I'm telling you, many years ago when Sony would roll out new models of headphones I would spend 2 to 3 times as much as this pair, thinking that the quality would be a step up. That was NEVER the case. These headphones have stood the test of time and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They are durable, and reproduce voice, music, ANYTHING with a clarity that is unrivaled.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The greatest headphones ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1104537600, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2005"}
