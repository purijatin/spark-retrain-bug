I am, by no means, an audiophile, but I could immediately tell the difference in sound quality over any headphones I have ever used. These are way more comfortable and seemingly a lot higher quality as well. Sometimes I put them on just to drown out the ambient noise, as they work beautifully at isolating external sound. I also love the fact that you can replace just the cups when they wear down. I'm very happy with this purchase and feel that these are top of the line. Additionally, my brother feels seems to think these perform better than his beats by dre headphones (I personally never jumped on that bandwagon). Overall, a great product at a great price. Would recommend all day long.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V6 Studio Monitor Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
