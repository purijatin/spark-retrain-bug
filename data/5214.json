This made me extremely annoyed/angry/disappointed.  I cannot stand bad crap, and I hate to give bad product reviews. But I had to send it back and now I will look for a different company brand, probably for the rest of my life.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "crackle in bass", "unixReviewTime": 1341446400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2012"}
