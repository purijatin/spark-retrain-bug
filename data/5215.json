Both of these are EXCELLENT headphones.  Although the MDR-V6 are an EXCELLENT choice and an industry standards, I thought the sound was a tad bit less full sounding than the MDR-V700DJ's.  It may just be that the sound pressure level (?) was greater on the MDR-V700's since they have larger drivers.  I am very impressed with BOTH headphones, and I will most likely be doing the mastering of my musical projects with both headphones, as well as with my monitoring speakers (Event Project Studio 8 monitors, excellent!).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V6 vs. Sony MDR-V700DJ", "unixReviewTime": 1177027200, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2007"}
