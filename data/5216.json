The style is professional and mature, not flashy. After trying on my friends' headphones like Beats, Skullcandys, or DNAs, I've always felt that the Sony MDR-V6's were better. They give you the sound that music artists want you to hear. (Most recording studios use these headphones or the MDR 7506 which I haven't tried yet)The sturdiness of these headphones are amazing. I've stepped on them, sat on them, dropped them. And they're still fine.If you're looking for affordable, high-quality headphones you MUST get these or the MDR7506's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've had these for 3 years.
