At that time, they were highly recommended.  They still are.  That should tell you something.  Second recommendation:  Do you watch any concerts via DVD?  Ever notice performers wearing a traditional set of headphones?  Those pros are often wearing MDR-V6's;  they're distinctive, with a red horizontal stripe across the back of each driver.Two issues: Vinyl coating that flakes off the ear cups; when it happens, just peel the rest off.  The fuzzy fabric beneath ends up being more comfortable than the vinyl, since it 'breathes' and your ears stay cooler.Electrostatic discharge (zaps to your ears, in a dry wintry environment);  I fixed that, by removing one ear cup, and attached a fine brass wire loop that I grounded to the neutral wire that serves the L & R drivers.  This fine wire shows / is visible inside the ear cup.  In use, this rests on my ear (not detectable as pressure on the ear) and constantly drains off any static electricity buildup.  Bottom line: no more zaps;So, ya want GREAT headphones?  Buy 'em and enjoy 'em.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "MDR-V6: It doesn't get better than this", "unixReviewTime": 1273276800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2010"}
