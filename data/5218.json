I have used them for listening to music, watching videos, and playing computer games. The audio quality is very balanced and if anything the sound feels a little light or thin, but if you add bass through an equilizer, it will come through. They are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for long periods of time. I was impressed at first with how much they also deaden any external noise, too. The cord should be long enough for any setting and the storage bag is nice enough. Overall, I don't regret this purchase at all and I would recommend them to a friend.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nothing Special, But Good Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1360627200, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2013"}
