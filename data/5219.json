These are virtually the identical head phones. My only complaint is that the very supple ear covers had a small slit right near the edge. This does not take away from my listening experience, so I still gave them 5 stars. The sound quality is still excellent, full range and neutral. I will always own a set of these. I was planning to buy the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 ear cushions anyway.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headset", "unixReviewTime": 1374969600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2013"}
