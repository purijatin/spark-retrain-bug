I originally bought a pair of V6 at Best Buy ten years ago. YES, ten years later they are still functioning well except the ear pad falling off and I replaced the ear pad. It sounds still amazing compare to a lot of phones I got in recent years - Bose, even compare to B&W.... This is definitely worth the SONY brand. Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the Best Headphone After Ten Years!", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}
