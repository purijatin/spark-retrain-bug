The included muffs only lasted 1 year before they started slipping off very often and flaking.  I bought a replacement for $20 and I thought I would be good.  All of a sudden the left speaker stopped working, 2 years after the purchase date.  I'm not wasting my time with any more sony trash.  Save yourself some time and go with a better brand.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Junk, Don't waste your time", "unixReviewTime": 1388448000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2013"}
