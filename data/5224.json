The sound production is very good.  I've only tried it through my phone's music player using high bitrate mp3's so not exactly the best source, so I'm not going to dig too deep into sound quality.  I'll just say that I am happy with the sound production.On the comfort side, the cups are pretty comfortable.  I've repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears.  The only slight discomfort I experienced was from the head band.  I wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head.  As it is, the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile.  But that could just be the shape of my head.In terms of manufacturering, the product feels quality made, from the band all the way down to the end of the plug.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1346198400, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2012"}
