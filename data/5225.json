Does not include an AC adapter. The HP adapter costs a fortune ($55). Buy a cheaper Sony 6v 700mA adapter as another reviewer notes...it'll do the same thing for about $20.2. Get NiMH batteries and a charger (Target carries these) otherwise you'll soon begin to hate this machine, especially if you download pics to your PC a lot.3. This one includes no carrying case. Consider the PDC 700 instead.4. This camera is a good quality HP one, but has a cheap plastic look to it. Alternatives in the same $ range include the Kodak DC215 for about $260", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Beware of the extra expenses!", "unixReviewTime": 952387200, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2000"}
