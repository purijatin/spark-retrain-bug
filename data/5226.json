This unit doesn't include the external power supply, so I would buy one or a card reader for downloading the photos to your PC - or if you are buying a photo printer, too, the HP  models (1000, 1100) have a built in card reader.  Downloading drains the  batteries quickly.  I like the color LCD for reviewing your pictures and  the megapixel resolution produces nice, photo quality shots with good  detail.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good entry level camera", "unixReviewTime": 944438400, "reviewTime": "12 6, 1999"}
