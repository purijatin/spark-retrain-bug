Sure, these days my main camera is a 10 Megapixel with 12X optical zoom and a staggering amount of features, but I still look back on my old HP C200 with fondness.  It was, after all, my first digital camera.  It also captured many, many, many memories over the decade.  My old HP C200 still gets used these days as well.  I use it for rugged outdoor activities that I don't want to expose my main camera to.  Its fully decked out with all the accessories that were prohibitively expensive or did not even exist in 1999: 2800 MAh NiMH rechargeable batteries, 2000 MAh NiMH Eneloop LSD batteries, 256MB CF, and even that (then) prohibitively expensive AC adapter that I paid $5 for.
