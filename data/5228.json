Takes good pictures.Drawbacks other than battery life:1. Only 1 pic review at a time as opposed to a collage review by the Olympus brands.2. Long delay from the time you hit the photo button and get a picture causes folks to relax before the pic is taken.  Ruins some shots.3. Very clunky camera considering it has no optical zoom.Now, the battery life.  I have yet been able to fill my flash memory without having to change batteries.  I get about 10 -15 pictures before it is flashing and beeping to tell me the battery is dead.  This makes the camera unacceptable, and I am looking for a new one solely for this reason.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Battery Life Makes It Nearly Unusable...", "unixReviewTime": 1012089600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2002"}
