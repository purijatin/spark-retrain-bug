I have had major problems with this camera since day one. I bought the camera 7 months ago and: 1)  the flash has stopped working, 2) the adapter plug will not stay in the  socket which means I have to hold it in while I take pictures (not easy to  do!) or else tape it on and 3) the batteries only last long enough to take  about 20 pictures. The quality of the photos are acceptable but using the  camera is often a nightmare. I do not enjoy using it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I must have got a faulty camera...", "unixReviewTime": 951782400, "reviewTime": "02 29, 2000"}
