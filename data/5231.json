All Sony's 9inch TV sets have very sharp and crisp images. Sony's Dynamic Picture Processor and Automatic White Balance increases picture fidelity. However, the fact alone that this is a 9\" inch set means that the electron gun has a very short distance to aim and deliver a precise image against the phosphor screen. The closer the electron gun is to the back of the tube's screen almost always guarantees a good picture. This picture is exceptionally crisp and sharp resulting in incredible fidelity.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Precisely Perfect Picture Fidelity", "unixReviewTime": 988588800, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2001"}
