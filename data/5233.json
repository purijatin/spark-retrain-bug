My only reservation about the set is how high I have to turn up the volume in order to hear it.  This may be a function of its'  sitting under a cabinet in a corner of my kitchen, but I really need to  crank it.  It also doesn't mask the static if I turn my satellite receiver  off before the set (my other sets do).  However, I like the set well enough  that I'm considering getting another one for my upstairs bathroom.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great small set", "unixReviewTime": 950313600, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2000"}
