This set has flush buttons that are water resistant, the picture is good every time, and even the automatic (when muted) closed-captioning is useful. The FM tuner is gone, but it wasn't that good anyway.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Old model was good, new model is great.", "unixReviewTime": 987465600, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2001"}
