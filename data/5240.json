I'm visually impaired, so when I need to type from printed material, or enter store receipts, I first record myself reading, and then type while the machine dictates to me.  This is not the machine for playing stereo music cassettes (you can, but it won't sound great - it's too small, and is not stereo).  If you just want a basic cassette recorder with big easy buttons, and no extras to get in the way, this is the one.  In fact, I've owned several of these, and they're very dependable and long-lasting.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple", "unixReviewTime": 1201478400, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2008"}
