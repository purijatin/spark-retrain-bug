It's a tape player and recorder, and that's it.It never jams on a good tape. It's perfect at what it does.Being an audiobook lover I use it to listen to my books around the house and it has had a lot of use!Unlike units that have CD players, the tape is the focus, not an afterthought.Also, it's far superior to tape units that switch sides for you, because they often switch sides at the least resistance, not necessarily the end of the tape.In summation, this is the tape audiobook listener's friend for reliable, no trouble, listening for hours and hours and years to come..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Solid Machine", "unixReviewTime": 1057968000, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2003"}
