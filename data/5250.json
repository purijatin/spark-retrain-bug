I needed something quick and easy to use.  I have gone through countless CD/Cassette players that break down within a year.  Plus, to find one now that has a built in mic is almost impossible, so I was very happy to find this product.I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far it has been a God-sent.  The minute I hear a song forming within my mind I can quickly grab the unit, flip it on and I'm set to go. Great! No more lost songs floating around the atmosphere but now they are safe on my cassette until I am ready to transfer them.It is also  great to use during church meeting when you want to be able to record either the sermon or some other happening so you can reflect back on it at a later time.My granddaughter had fun recording her voice the other day and other sounds as well.....This little guy has countless uses and it is sturdy, well made and very easy to use.  I like it and will write another review in a year and let you know how well it held up to the often use it will definitely receive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1276128000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2010"}
