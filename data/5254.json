Huber \"Addicted to books!\"", "helpful": [16, 16], "reviewtext": "If you shoot low res pix only (640x480), you'll get about 100 pix out of this memory stick, which isn't a bad amount of pix, but it also means you are shooting low resolution.  If you're only taking pix for the web, that's great, and this memory stick will get you pretty far.  But, if you are hoping to print your images out, you'll want to shoot higher resolution, which means the 16MB memory stick isn't quite big enough if you're hoping to go out on a trip (unless you buy a few of them).  I recommend at least a 32MB memory stick.As with all Sony products, this is, of course, well made and solid, and works like a charm.  Just make sure you know how much memory you need, and then buy more, always.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better than 4 MB, but don't trust a vacation to this one", "unixReviewTime": 974592000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2000"}
