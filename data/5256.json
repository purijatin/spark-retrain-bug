For low resolution pictures (VGA) and low resolution videos (160), no, this memory stick is the perfect buy. But, if you like your pictures and videos high quality and full screen, don't even think about buy this memory stick. On low setting pictures (VGA), you get I think 96 pictures, and on low setting videos (160) I think you get about 11 and a half minutes. However, on medium setting pics (4) you get only 8 pics and on medium setting video (640 Standard) you only get 42 seconds to be exact. You should be saying that is ridiculous! But, for people who don't really care much about quality or resolution, this is a perfect buy for you, though, if you like medium/high quality and high resolution pics and vids, I recommend the 256MB memory stick (SDMSV-256).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very weak capacity for full screen", "unixReviewTime": 1104019200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2004"}
