But after continued use in TRV900, TRV11 video cams and the Sony Clie PDA- I have to say I'm very happy with the memory stick's flexibility. I usually hate being stuck in a specific company format, but at least Sony did it right.The transfer rate in the Clie is very rapid.  Backing up the entire contents of the Clie takes literally a few seconds.  The Clie has a program that allows you RUN programs off of the memory stick.  This is not the fastest operating speed, but it is no worse than a Zip drive disk.The size and reliability is unbeatable.  Compared to a San memory card that has lost it's life after 1 year, the Sony memory sticks have performed flawlessly for pics, data, and application runs.These smaller MB sizes aren't fair for the price.  Go for the 32+ MB and up - just like a hard drive, you think a realistic amount is adequate.  But once you start shooting and using, you'll wish you upgraded for the bigger stick.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Peeved at first, but delighted with consistent performance", "unixReviewTime": 1007683200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2001"}
