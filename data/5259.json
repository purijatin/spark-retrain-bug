This one does not have all of those features. BUT it tracks beautifully, speed is consistent, and the furnished Audio Technica cartridge is adequate.  Of course the first thing I did was change out the cartridge to a Shure M97xE and now it makes me remember why I liked the sound of vinyl.  CD's and MP3s are OK but with this turntable and the Shure cartridge you can really tell the difference!  My records are being played again and the sound is terrific!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Bang for the Buck!", "unixReviewTime": 1304726400, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2011"}
