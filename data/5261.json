This turntable is TOTALLY manual! Cool if you don't mind \"tweaking\" the 'table every so often. The unit itself is pretty heavy-about 15 pounds-and very solid-what you want for full sounding analog. The pitch control works great once you get the motor adjusted-overlooked in the so called owner's manual. The 33 and 45 motor speed adjustments are on the bottom. The supplied cartridge sounds pretty good-again once you properly align it-another point omitted in the \"manual.\" If you overlook the sparse info in the manual and take your time setting it up you'll be rewarded with a surprisingly good sounding system! If you can get this 'table on sale you won't be disappointed. Don't forget it's not and doesn't pretend to be the equivalent of a Thorens, Music Hall, Rega or other high end unit. The bottom line is this table is a GOOD SOUNDING GOOD DEAL!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Manual Turntable", "unixReviewTime": 1112313600, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2005"}
