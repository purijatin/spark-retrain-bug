These JOKERS should seek help before buying a product and writing negative reviews because THEY bought the wrong product! GEEZ!This USB extension cable has performed beyond my expectations for over 8 months. There has been NO noticeable [at least not to me] degradation in performance to my accessories [digital camera, webcam and JUMPDRIVE ] by using this extension cord and it means that I do not have to be fiddling behind or leaning down in front of the computer to attach and detach the equipment.It is a GREAT buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's AMAZING....", "unixReviewTime": 1076112000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2004"}
