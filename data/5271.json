It took almost 3 weeks to get them, and now that I have tried both of the cables I am not impressed with the quality of the product or the shipper. A consistent connection is iffy at best, not like the other cables that I currently have, so the problem is not with my system it is with the cables. When I finally received them, the plastic package had yellowed. So these units were either old or had been exposed to sunlight for a long period of time. Save your time and money, order them from somebody else.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "not impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1341014400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2012"}
