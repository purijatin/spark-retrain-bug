(The outlet is on the floor) Now I can plug one end of this cable into the charger/outlet and leave it there, then loop the cable behind and onto my desk and plug in my charger! Now my charger could reach my phone/desk. Works perfect to extend any USB Charger! Only gripe is the price. Wish it was a tad cheaper, hence the 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014"}
