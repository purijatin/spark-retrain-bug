I have a keyboard, a Yamaha MM6 that I wanted to attach to my computer, so I can record through Cubase LE. I started tripping over the standard size cord, so I added this Belkin extension, and now it is safely tucked away. Sure beats having to replace the USB port in the computer from abuse. Belkin makes nice stuff, and this is one of those things that they make well. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's a Winner", "unixReviewTime": 1211587200, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2008"}
