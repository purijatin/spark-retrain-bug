Replacing a worn out extension cable, these seem to only last about a year or so before they get flaky. Rated one star short because the female end is not overmolded (could have sworn the image showed that when I made the selection?!?). Still a good deal and its a brand name cable. Will probably buy more in a year or so", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good quality cable", "unixReviewTime": 1359763200, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2013"}
