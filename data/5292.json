There's even room for relocating further from the PC. Nice!The connection was easily made and performance is seamless. Never a glitch or interruption.To reiterate some of the other reviewers' point: This is an EXTENSION cable, akin to an extension cord. Unlike an extension cord, however, length matters. Be sure you've chosen the proper footage for your application.On a final note, the price is exceptional. Lesser quality extension cables (if you can find 'em) at brick and mortar retailers are ridiculously overpriced.This Belkin product helps efficiently utilize space in my small home office.  In my non-tech opinion, this extension cable is just perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just Perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1263254400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2010"}
