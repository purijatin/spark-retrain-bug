I shopped many stores in my area and the price was $35-$40 either of Monster Cable (also known as the \"I am a yuppie and have too much money burning a hole in my pocket\" brand) or of indeterminate quality. I was not going to drop money in that range for something that might have cost fifty cents in China to make and I was not going to enable a corporation like Monster, who I feel is fleecing consumers with technological snake oil.I found this cable from Belkin, a very reliable company. The insulation & connectors are high quality. The wire feels of a decent enough gauge to last many years. This is a real value for money purchase. If you need one, you are not risking anything buying this cable.I deducted one star due to the Fort KnoX like clam shell packaging of heavy duty plastic that you will have to attack with a box cutter to free your purchase. If they has a security pull tab to make retrieval of the product easier, I would have rated this a full five stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An honest USB Extension cord that is not way over priced", "unixReviewTime": 1321574400, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2011"}
