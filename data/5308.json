Belkin's products have always been reliable, and this one is no different.The Belkin F3U134-10 is a 20-gauge 10' USB cable, A plug to A receptacle.  I use mine on an older PC that only has USB ports on the back of its tower. Thanks to this cable, I no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my USB memory key.If you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable, be aware of recommended USB cable length limits.  Low-density devices (e.g. mice and keyboards) should not exceed cable lengths of 10', while high-density USB devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of 16 feet. If you plan to extend your current USB cable beyond these limits, consider getting a repeating cable such as the Belkin Active Extension USB Cable.Perhaps the best reason to buy this USB cable from Amazon is to get their hefty discount on Belkin products. You'll pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store.  Now that's a bargain!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazon and Belkin team up for another great deal", "unixReviewTime": 1112140800, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2005"}
