Obviously whoever manufactured it intended the cord to reach from the PC monitor/LCD to the back of the computer, and nothing more. This was unacceptable.&#60;P&#62;Luckily I browsed around and found this cable, which was a lifesaver. It's got a female &#34;A&#34; plug on one side and a male &#34;A&#34; plug on the other, effectively working as an &#34;extension cord&#34; (to be plugged in the middle, between your pc and one of your existing USB cables that is attached to your USB device).Very good quality cables. Inexpensive price. To paraphrase Jerry Pournelle on the legendary Byte magazine: &#34;Recommended!&#34;. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great, quality cable", "unixReviewTime": 1096156800, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2004"}
