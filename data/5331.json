I got it to be able to charge my Turtle Beach XP400 headset while I am using them, since the only plug I can use that won't be in the way is behind the couch on the other side of the living room. It works great, keeping me in the game longer. Definitely a great buy. I would recommend this cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works perfectly!", "unixReviewTime": 1361318400, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2013"}
