Works great and by a reputable company.  It replaced one that I purchased online that stopped working when I dropped it out of a window accidentally.  (Ironically, the wireless receiver didn't break when it hit the floor, just the USB extender - so I bought this to replace it.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works how it should", "unixReviewTime": 1362355200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2013"}
