I have found that Belkin cables are of high quality, at least by my standards. 10 ft. is more than I need really, but it is nice to have. Be advised this is not a USB 2.0 cable and many devices require one. ALSO, this is an extension, not a printer cable. Some devices will not work at all or will not perform properly with a 10ft.USB cable and Belkin gives you a small list of these devices on the packaging. The Amazon price is less than half what my local stores want for the same exact cable and I am happy with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent cable for very little money!", "unixReviewTime": 1245196800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2009"}
