Cable also did not work, all items show up as not recognized.This seller needs to be investigated. The seller is purposefully ordering fake cables and selling them as name brand (with the name brand price to boot)I can understand this happening once but with so many complaints about the same issue, and me getting the same issue, this seller is clearly engaging in false advertising and judging by how far this goes back, they most likely know about it and choose to do nothing about it. (seems amazon does not list the most recent reviews under the product description)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "MarginMart, Inc. is selling fake cables", "unixReviewTime": 1331596800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012"}
