The picture is of a gray cable with the Belkin name molded in the plastic ends.  I received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker. It was sold by \"marginmart inc\" and fulfilled by amazon.  I feel I was lied to and ripped off.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "NOT  BELKIN !!", "unixReviewTime": 1327708800, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2012"}
