It is ok but there have got to be others out there that will work better. I mean, Belkin makes some great products but this is not top of the list. I use it and its ok but I would really like to find a 10 foot iPad cord that actually works and not rely on thsi thing. When your computer is plugged in, it should not run down to 70% when being used. So, based on that...I consider this product kind of a failure and the only reason it gets 2 stars is that I actually do use it", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Slows down charging", "unixReviewTime": 1363132800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2013"}
