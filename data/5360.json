That's why so many other reviewers found that it didn't work with their devices, since most current devices need USB 2.0 spec cables. I elected to return my cable to Amazon for a refund. They said no need to return it, they'll just give the refund.Moral: If a USB cable does not explicitly state that it is USB 2.0 (or USB 3.0) then it's probably a USB 1.1 cable that won't support most of today's peripherals.Note: I knew this already, but people should take note that a USB extension cable can only be used together with another USB cable, to extend the length of the connection. It's not suitable for directly connecting a device to your computer without that normal cable.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This is a USB 1.1 cable, NOT USB 2.0", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2012"}
