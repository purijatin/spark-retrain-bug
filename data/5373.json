Please disregard negative reviews by others who say it can't connect between device and PC. This is to extend what you already have so it doesn't clutter things more. A good example is if you have an iPHone with the 3Ft charging usb cable, and your PC is on the floor, you can connect this extension cable on a rear USB port, and extend it to the desktop, poking out a little, yet not adding to clutter. Then you can connect your iPhone usb charging cable to the female end of this extension, as if it was your PC directly. Works well, and I highly recommend this cable to extend your USB needs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extends your USB needs", "unixReviewTime": 1358899200, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2013"}
