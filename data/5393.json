Like one of the other reviewers, I needed it to extend the USB hub for playing Rock Band on my XBOX360.  This cable works great, and now there is no risk of people yanking the cord out of the console while 'rocking out'.  I haven't tried it with any PC accessories, but as far as I can tell it maintains a solid connection without any issues.For a price of less than $6 and a brand name like Belkin, you really can't go wrong with this cable if you are looking for a USB extension.  Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Cable, does what you need it to", "unixReviewTime": 1201219200, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2008"}
