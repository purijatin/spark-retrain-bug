But this cable makes it possible to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics.  With this Belkin component, you can now think of setting up an entire room as an information hub, rather than just huddling your computer station into a cramped corner.  For those who have multiple platforms in one area, this extension cord will make it possible to more easily share USB devices without having to buy an additional USB switcher.  Just plug and unplug your devices at will with the additional length.If there's anything negative to say about the product, it's that you don't have much choice as to manufacturer.  In a real sense, that doesn't matter:  you're going to be happy with what Belkin has on offer.  But it would be at least psychologically comforting to have more of a choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get the clutter off your desk", "unixReviewTime": 1000771200, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2001"}
