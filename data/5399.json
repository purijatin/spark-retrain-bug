They are sharp, with excellent color and low noise. Consumer camcorders, even digital ones, left me cold. They just didn't cut it compared to the pro gear I had used. That is, until I saw the Sony TRV900.This baby is really a sleeper. The picture quality from this 3 chip camera is professional quality. The picture is very sharp, digital artifacts are not noticeable, and the picture is amazingly noise free, even in marginal light. (In low light,it's noisy, like all CCD cameras.) Manual controls on almost everything let you tweak the picture as you learn more.It doesn't look &quot;pro&quot; so it might not impress your friends, until they see the results. And the sound quality is not quite up to the picture quality, at least with the built in mics. But if you want to really do some fine quality videography which could be shown anywhere, even on network TV, this is your best choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Pro Camcorder in Consumer Clothing", "unixReviewTime": 971740800, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2000"}
