Vles", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I find myself using the DCR-TRV900 as a digital camera almost as a matter of course.  I purchased the Sony 64Mb memory card (you need to also buy the PCMCIA attachment that it fits in) and taking pictures is a veritable joy. The supplied floppy drive is next to useless - in fact, I don't know how you'd use it in an active environment. There are manual options: aperture setting (depth of field) and shutter speed (great for darker environments)among them. You can also record stills right on the tape and later extract them on your computer.  Transfering video and stills to a PC is effortless; I use the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) interface.  To make great movies, including voice over (if needed) and background music, I'm happy with Ulead Video Studio rather than the Microsoft XP Windows Movie Maker program - which appears to be a minimal implementation of Ulead's program.  Adobe Premier 5.0 might still be better, but I'm not professional enough to shell out [that kind of money] or so for that program.  By the way, Ulead also allows you to create NTSC VCD files, which, once downloaded to a regular CD-ROM (I use Easy Cd Creator Platinum), can be played on your DVD player (not all of them, but certainly those produced in the last 2 years).  Anyway, a great camcorder and camera; I find myself walking around with it for hours on end - it just feels good!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great - without a single doubt", "unixReviewTime": 1011225600, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2002"}
