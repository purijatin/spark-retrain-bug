This camcorder is one of them (the others are their first SACD, first DVD player, first walkman, first digital walkman, first trinitron TV, etc...) This camcorder provides broadcast quality-- sharpness, color saturation are first rate. I also tried other 1 CCD camcorders and none of them come close to the performance and construction quality of TRV900. The only drawback I can think of is the TRV900 has a bit of bluish tone in the color which can't be adjusted and the brightness is one stop too bright (which can be adjusted)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great camcorder", "unixReviewTime": 999820800, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2001"}
