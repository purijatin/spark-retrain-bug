Excellent picture quality; Sony steady-shot that really works; still-image capture to tape (or extra adapter card+memory stick a must!); bright LCD display; variable audio feedback; IEEE firewire,  controls that are easy to reach and are learned-responses for those  familiar with previous Sony cams.Specifically, we use this unit for  green-screen compositing of people, environments, and virtual products. The  firewire coupled with Adobe Premier is a god-send. Simply said, that is  essentially all you need (plus consistent overall lighting in a  green-screen environment). G3 or PC - firewire will suck it down as fast as  anything I've seen.Positively get the custom aluminum case if you do a  lot of travel and want to keep your camera happy. This will keep all your  components safe and somewhat easily accessible. Get a 2+ hour battery; the  NP-750 battery has plenty of gas - surprisingly the LCD does not drain the  juice too quickly. A PC transfer card for the memory stick would be nice -  but you can get away with plugging the IEEE and transferring from memory  card or to tape.The construction and attention to product detail is  marvelous. Little rubber covers, positive audio clicks, all the nifty  nick-nacks want you to have Sony make your next car. Sure there are a few  quirks - but there's few products that have such high quality and high  value as the TRV900!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the Best Product Design - ever", "unixReviewTime": 961459200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2000"}
