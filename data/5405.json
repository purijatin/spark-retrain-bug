Put that Spot meter to careful use, and you can get more depth-of-field and less flash use. Also, after days of heavy rain recently here in California, the Weather Resistant features are nice, too. This camera really IS a great value!OLD REVIEW:I'd suggest finding an old Olympus XA in good condition instead of this mostly pre-programmed techno-cam, although it does have a sharp lens..and it's very small and light too. But the autofocus is a little touchy, and it wants to shoot at f2.8 in any kind of even slightly low light. With the XA, you can choose any aperture(or ISO!)you want, and the lens is even sharper..of course, you might have to use a tripod too, but the Stylus Epic won't really acknowledge that choice!However, within its' parameters, it's a slick little camera, and you really shouldn't have to pay too much for it; refurbished ones go for under $50.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good Within Its' Limitations, could use more manual controls, but Spot Meter helps!", "unixReviewTime": 1188432000, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2007"}
