I have three teenage daughters that love taking pictures. My second daughter just turned 16. I bought my oldest daughter a stylus when she turned 16. They like the camera because of its small compact size and ease of use. It fits nicely in their purse. After comparing every camera I could find for under $100, the Stylus had much better quality. In order to find as good a camera, I had to double the price. The viewfinder alone, is larger than most, very clear and crisp. Never had a single problem with the first Stylus. The fact that the price has come down is a real plus also. I paid more for the Stylus two years ago, than the one bought recently. I give this little camera a 5 star. You will not be disappointed. It's a really nice little camera. It's easy to use, attractive and it is not cluttered up with whistles &amp; bells you'll never use. Just point and shoot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top Quality for the price", "unixReviewTime": 982540800, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2001"}
