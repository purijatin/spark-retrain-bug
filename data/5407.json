I've taken photos with the object very close to the camera (15 inch) with the spot metering mode with candle light, tripod, without flash, ASA 400, with impressive results.2. I've taken photos with the object very close to the camera (14 inch) with to spot mering mode with flash, without over exposure and impressive results.So, I would support that the short (14 inch) focus capability is great and useful. If you want close photos of objects with a idiot proof little camera, I mean without zoom, tele, macro as it should be this is the choice.3. I had met several focus problems with objects at 2m from the camera, hope that practice would help me to improove. However some photos have excellent focus and sharpness.4. Excellent dark sunset photos with the night scene mode with ASA 100 and tripod.5. Red eye reduction pre strobes are unconfortable, but very effective.6. I prefer this than cheap zoom cameras.Definitevely I support the several comments of experts telling this is incredible considering the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive, but not perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1102636800, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2004"}
