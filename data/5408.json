{"reviewerID": "AKT8TGIT6VVZ5", "asin": "B000021YU8", "reviewerName": "John Kwok", "helpful": [30, 30], "reviewtext": "This camera is one which has consistently received lavish praise from photo magazines such as Popular Photography for its ease of use and its superb Zuiko lens, which is comparable in quality to 35mm Single Lens Reflex (SLR) fixed focal length wide angle lenses. I've borrowed one belonging to relatives and am quite impressed with how it easy it is to use, as well as the fine pictures that it produces. Admittedly, it is a bit small, so those who are comfortable using larger point and shoot cameras or SLRs will have to try to hold it steady. Otherwise, you'll get blurry pictures. My favorite point and shoot camera is the Yashica T4 Super with its 35mm Carl Zeiss Tessar f3.5 T* lens, but the 38mm Zuiko lens on the Stylus Epic is just as contrasty and sharp. Furthermore, the Stylus Epic is at least $50 cheaper than the Yashica T4 Super. Those who want high quality pictures from an inexpensive point and shoot camera should strongly consider buying this petite gem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent fixed focal length point and shoot camera", "unixReviewTime": 983318400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2001"}
