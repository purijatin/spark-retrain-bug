Film is still a great affordable option for high quality pictures if you scan your negatives.  Plus without an LCD to worry about how the last picture looked, I can focus on taking the next picture.Right out of the box, the size impressed me, it is one of the most compact 35mm cameras I've ever seen in person.  Only a Canon Elph is smaller, but that's basically a rectangle.  The Stylus Epic is one of the best handling cameras I've ever touched. Modern digitals are mostly rectangles, but the Stylus has a great tapered design that feels great in your hand.  The shape is also perfect for sliding in your pocket.  The sliding cover is also the on/off switch, so there's no odd buttons or switches to slow you down.  On top of that, loading film couldn't be easier.My main concern is that the camera is rather loud when it advances film, so its not exactly a subtle camera, but otherwise I am glad I picked this up.Update: having just developed a few rolls, I am very impressed by the optics of this camera.  Just a \"generic\" 400 speed film yielded pleasing results, but I noticed some quirks.  First of all, due to the rather wide lens, you want to get up close and fill the frame... but the lens cannot focus closer than about arms reach.  Not much of a problem for most situations, but closeups aren't really suited to this camera.  And then there is the flash... yikes!  If you can avoid it (and you can with fast film and a steady hand), do not use the flash...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Noisy little sucker, but a classic nonetheless", "unixReviewTime": 1242259200, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2009"}
