Lens is actually a little wider then 35mm (~32mm).  Lens sharpness is good for a P&amp;S but does not compare to good SLR optics like Nikon.  Cameras operation has some idiosyncrasies like how you get to spot metering mode, the fact that the focus is driven solely by the indicators in the center, etc.  The date stamping is a little too small and too close to the center of the image.  Red-eye is a problem.  The viewfinder is very tiny and has severe distortion. Overall, a good, but not great, little camera...If you can spend more get the Yashica T4 w/Zeiss lens.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value...", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
