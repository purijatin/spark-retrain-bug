Amirault", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewtext": "Popular Photography recently called this camera \"...possibly the best camera in the universe and I agree.It is small, light, it has an *excellent* quality lens. The lens quality is way above the average point and shoot. The lack of zoom is one of the reasons the lens can be *so* good. Maximum lens opening of f2.8 and maximum shutter speed of 1/1000 sec (but no 'manual' setting)It has an 'intellegent' flash that reduces flash intensity for close-up shots (prevents overexposure!) Many different available 'modes' give you great versatlity, including 'red eye' flash mode and a 'spot' metering option.I own 4 of these cameras!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT little camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1006041600, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2001"}
