But the feature I like best is the accurate  exposure system. The default automatic mode uses fill flash effectively.  You can also force the flash off or on, or combine foreground flash with  long exposure for night scenes.The flash is bright enough to reach 27'  with ISO 400 film, and its brightness is automatically reduced to prevent  overexposure of subjects as close as 1.1'. The flash is close to the lens,  so you should use the red-eye-reduction mode when the ambient lighting is  dim and your subject's pupils are dilated. Using this mode, I have never  shot a subject with red eyes.If you don't absolutely need a zoom lens,  this is a handy camera that takes great pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clear pictures", "unixReviewTime": 942451200, "reviewTime": "11 13, 1999"}
