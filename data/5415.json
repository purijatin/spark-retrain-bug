(for different family members) It is reliable. It takes great pictures.  It has the necessary features but not so many that one is overwhelmed. It fits easily in a shirt pocket. It doesn't have a zoom but that is just one less thing to break or use up your batteries. If you want to fill the frame just get closer to your subject. It doesn't have all the whistles and bells of larger more expensive cameras but a camera you have takes better pictures than one you left behind because it was too big or so expensive that you didn't want to risk losing it.I have the usual assortment of larger fully featured cameras as well as the required digital camera but I wouldn't be without one of these little beasts.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great little camera", "unixReviewTime": 1021939200, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2002"}
