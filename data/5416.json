Take it from me, I'm no stranger to digital photography. I was using my Sharp digital camcorder to take digital still pictures but I was not very impressed with the results. Moreover, a camcorder is too bulky to haul around. So I decided to go with a smaller camera. I did a lot of research before settling on the D-450 camera from Olympus.It is feature rich, looks very cute, and delivers pictures with a punch. It works effortlessly on my Windows XP. My favorite feature is the 3X optical zoom (digital zooms are generally useless). The LCD screen is crisp and clear, although it's use should be limited to preserve battery life (Use the LCD only to review already taken shots. Do not use it for taking pictures - use the viewfinder). The video output works great. I could go on and on. It's comnpatible with SmartMedia which, in my humble opinion, is the better storage medium.Overall, I am quite impressed with the D-450 Zoom. It's simply a wonderful camera. I wouldn't expect less from Olympus. Regarding complaints about lack of a USB port for downloading: Just get a SmartMedia card reader. A good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot. I personally use PNY SmartMedia card reader but any good card reader should do. Not only does a card reader download your pictures at blazingly fast speeds, you also save your batteries by not using your camera to download the pictures.PS: If you are looking to save money, consider getting a refurbished camera. They come with a 90-day manufacturer's warranty and in most cases are essentially brand new cameras. I should know. I got mine refurbished :-)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The D-450 - Probably The Best In It's Class!", "unixReviewTime": 1024790400, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2002"}
