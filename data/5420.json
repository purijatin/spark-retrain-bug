I have dropped my Olympus d450 several times, and once I slammed it in a car door (in its case). For some strange reason, it still works fine.2.  You can get an mp3 player that uses the same type of memory card (smartmedia), buy a 32 Meg (smartmedia) chip, and reformat the card  for either device when the occasion  calls. A 32 meg card can hold either a couple hundred pictures, or about an  hour of music.3. The floppy adapter works well to transfer files to/from  the smartmedia card, and a usb smartmedia card reader works even better.  However, downloading data using camera and serial cable is quiet an  frustrating process (batteriy draning, time intensive, etc.)CONS- 1:  Start stockpiling AA batteries now, especially if you really like using the  LCD screen instead of the viewfinder.2: This isn't the kind of camera  you can whip out real fast and and take an instantaneous photo.  It takes  about four seconds from when you slide the cover open to when you can snap  a picture.All in all, a good buy", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Feels like a 35mm zoom n a good way", "unixReviewTime": 944438400, "reviewTime": "12 6, 1999"}
