It's quite large, it can barely be called a compact camera.  Also, the maximum aperture is a mere F4.5, so it's a good idea to use high-speed film.On the other hand, the picture quality is excellent, with SLR-type quality.  Genuinely much better than the results I can get from a similarly-sized digital camera, especially at the shorter end of the zoom.  And the flash does a pretty good job.  There's some red-eye, but in general it doesn't over-light scenes, the way most flashes do on small cameras.I had this camera for a number of years, and my friend still uses it.  Over the years it's developed a few problems: it makes a grinding sound as the zoom extends (it hasn't broken yet, but I expect it will someday), and it can be a little tricky to open the door enough to activate the camera.Maybe the still-in-production Stylus Epic 2.8 lens is a better choice - there's no zoom but it has a faster lens, a smaller body, and slightly better picture quality.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dated but good", "unixReviewTime": 1214006400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2008"}
