I never really had a use for a camera with a zoom lens.  I was always content to use my VERY simple point and shoot.  One day, my pictures came out so badly from my simple camera that I decided that I need to get one with a zoom lens.  I looked at many brands of cameras, but I never considered the Olympus.  Then one of my friends, who knows a lot more than I do about cameras, convinced me to test the Olympus Stylus Epic.  I fell instantly in love, and I bought it.  That choice has been the best decision I ever made!  I love the small size and sleek design of this camera.  I also LOVE all the bells and whistles on it, especially the timer because no one gets left out of the picture.  It also takes very good photographs.  I recommend this camera for anyone, including camera-challenged people like myself.  A great piece of equipment, and the price was very reasonable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to Love!", "unixReviewTime": 981849600, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2001"}
