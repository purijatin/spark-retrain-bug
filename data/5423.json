This should enhance its longevity, but don't expect to take it swimming. I'll let you know about durability in another 8 years.This isn't a replacement for an SLR (and isn't intended as one). The quality of pictures is somewhat less than you would experience with an SLR.But if you are attracted to point-and-shoot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and ergonometric elegance be sure to check this one out.
