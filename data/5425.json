It takes great pictures in light and dark (though it's better at outdoor pictures) and it fits easily into your pocket.  It opens quickly with one hand; no fumbling around with a lens cap.  It focuses quickly so you can take a shot from a closed position very quickly.The only thing worth noting is that this is a point and click camera.  If you want to control exposure, shutter speed, etc. or play with macro, this is not your camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "perfect point and click camera", "unixReviewTime": 1066780800, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2003"}
