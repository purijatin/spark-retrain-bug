Survives a drop onto the sidewalk (dropped from 2 feat from a bench).  Handles rain no problemo.  Still takes great pictures.  Small size is great and it's easy to use.  The editor review says battery compartment is hard to open -- It is unintuitive by the arrow direction (it looks straight), but look at the hindges and you'll figure it out.  The viewfinder is tiny, but it works just fine.  The camera's small size lets you get 2-3 extra pictures from a 24 exposure roll becuase you don't have to roll out the film at all to cross the camera body :)  It is so small that it fits in teh secondary compartment of the camera bag I bought along with it.The zoomer is cool.  They say that it is 2.2x, but a 35mm with no zoom is .45x, so you are actually getting 4x zoom relative to a non-zoom 35mm wide angle point and shoot.  This is the best bet for your money.  If you want more zoom, go get a professional camera, but with that much money (over $200), its time to go digital.This is the perfect camera for me going to LA and shooting at the LA Galaxy (Soccer MLS) players.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What a wonderful little camera", "unixReviewTime": 990316800, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2001"}
