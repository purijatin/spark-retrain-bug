Since having a kid our travel baggage tripled and I couldn't afford to carry my Canon Elan(great one when I bought in 1993) along with my camcoder.I looked around for a small 35mm point &amp; shoot and I decided on Delux edition of this one over Minolta Freedom zoom 125 &amp; 150 because of the price and reviews I read at this site. The delux edition has a more gold look to it and comes with a leather cover, battery, and has a panaromic mode function.Size is a big plus to this one even though the Minolta's looked more appealing to me. The pictures came great as mentioned in lot of other reviews. The best are the ones I took in the night with 'night scene' flash mode. One has to be VERY careful not to shake the camera when taking pictures in this mode.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "very impressive ..", "unixReviewTime": 976838400, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2000"}
