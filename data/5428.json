I'm not sure if the Epic Zoom 80 goes that low, but the fixed focal-length model does. So if you want a compact point and shoot camera with a relatively fast lens, this is about the only way to do it, unless you want to spend about a $1000 for a Rollei QZ35W (which, at 18 oz., is a tank compared to the Olympus. Of course, the Rollei has that amazing 1/8000th of second shutter speed, probably enough to freeze an airplane propeller, not just a golf swing).But getting back to the Olympus, there were a number of models that were F3.4 or F3.8, but the Olympus was the only one at F2.8.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A few comments", "unixReviewTime": 985651200, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2001"}
