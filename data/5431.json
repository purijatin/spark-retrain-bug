Haven't tried the 400 film yet, so I'm eager to try some outdoor evening pictures. However, with the 200 film, this camera still took some excellent night pictures (using a tripod) of downtown during Christmas season. Don't regret buying it one bit, best investment in a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Terrific pictures, very sharp and colorful.", "unixReviewTime": 1041811200, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2003"}
