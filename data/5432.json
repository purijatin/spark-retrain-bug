Want want want!&#34; Then I patiently waited until I found one in new condition.Here's the problem with this radio: standby time is about 10 days, without using it AT ALL, and it's completely dead.  Just sitting there running the clock will kill batteries.  I had a similar Sony (without speaker) which I left in a closet for more than a year and the battery was still working.I notice that a couple people report short battery life with the newer dt110 as well.  Maybe these things are OK if you use it every day and don't mind changing batteries constantly, but don't use too much effort obtaining one.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Don't bother hunting this down", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014"}
