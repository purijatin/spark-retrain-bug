It is very small (about the size of a deck of bridge cards) and I take it backpacking and all all of my trips.  I'm on my second one, first one stolen.  Weather brodcasts are a real nice touch, you don't have to wait for a TV or Radio announcement of the weather, when you can get the report and forecast direct from the NWS.TV, FM and AM all work great.  Good memory setting features of about 10 for each band.The Alarm is another nice feature when traveling.Also nice is the internal speaker, which is rare on a radio this small with this many bands and features.  The fidelity is all that you would expect from a 1&quot; speaker, but it is fine for what is is for like listening to news or a talk radio show.  The audio is stereo on the headphones on AM and is of very high quality on the headphones for all bands (TV, WX, AM and FM(stereo)).My only negative comment is minor, relating to battery life.  I have used alkaline and rechargables and I seem to only get about 8 - 12 hours, which is sufficient, but adds up over time.  I recommend the use of rechargable NiMh batteries with this unit to keep the operating costs down if you use it frequently as I do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice radio", "unixReviewTime": 1063497600, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2003"}
