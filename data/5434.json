Blackmon", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "Purchased radio for someone in the hospital who likes late night AM radio and hates television.  Normal AM radios did not have any reception in the ICU but this one did manage to tune two of her favorite stations.  Battery life could be better as it ate a new set of batteries each day. Tuning in the stations was initially difficult because when I tuned it  at my home with the auto-tune feature, it picked up over 80 stations some nearly 400 miles away. I just wanted it to receive her three favorite stations so I had to continuously delete stations until I got her three loaded.  It is tiny and will easily fit in a shirt pocket with room to spare. It is truly high tech and about 1/4 the size of a standard small radio.  It is not cheap or cheaply made.  If you like small electronic gadgets and can afford it, I would recommend you purchase one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tiny but powerful", "unixReviewTime": 1167782400, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007"}
