The weather band has always been poor in my area (which is why only 4 stars), but other than that no complaints. Oh, and obviously the TV function is no longer usefull, but I didn't get it for that. This is a small radio that does a good job pulling in stations.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good radio", "unixReviewTime": 1330905600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2012"}
