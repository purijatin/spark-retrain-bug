It has survived many drops.The DT-300-VW has the same ergonomic features, is smaller (but not much lighter), and adds a clock and weather radio reception.  The shutoff timer is 90 minutes instead of an hour, which I like, and the presets are much more convenient than the 200V.  My only quibble: no belt clip.  I like that it uses AAA instead of AA batteries, since I always have spares for my palm pilot and noise cancelling headphones.I haven't tested the earbuds that came with it--I'll probably throw them away.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice improvement over the DT 200V", "unixReviewTime": 1030579200, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2002"}
