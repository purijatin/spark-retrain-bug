I am constantly looking for the holy grail - a radio with great reception and plenty of features. I haven't found that yet but I can do comparisons. Here are the pros and cons of this one:Pros:1) This is truly a pocket radio and very light. It feels lighter than a deck of cards.2) Digital tuning - a rarity in pocket radios. You can quickly scan from station to station and from AM to FM to TV.3) Has a speaker built in. You don't need headphones. The sound quality is adequate for talk radio and AM music. The volume is adequate for quiet environments.4) It has TV audio and the reception was ok on the four major stations in my area.Cons:1) There is no built in FM telescoping antenna. You need to insert headphones or the included wire and switch it to speaker in order to get most FM stations. A small telescoping antenna would have been an improvement. I find the hanging wire annoying and I think it is just a matter of time before I lose the wire.2) The reception is not as great as the Amazon review suggests. I found that there was a good deal of static on several AM stations and AM is very dirctional. FM was great on headphones, though.3) The cary case is a joke. It looks like an afterthought. It is a membrane thin piece of vinyl that will not protect the radio.4) The ear buds are also a joke.5) Weather reception was the worst I have ever heard on a modern radio.6) The tuning light is bright and, no doubt, draining the batteries like crazy.If you are looking for a pocket radio that is digital and has a built in speaker, this will do. I see lots of room for improvement, though. I also think it is overpriced. I think it should be 39.99. It would be about right at that price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pros and cons", "unixReviewTime": 1082332800, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2004"}
