It proved to be a good radio for traveling and an adequate radio for use at the ball park.  In the ball park reception was bad in certain areas and in other areas the radio had to be turned to tune in the station.  Since I live in an area by the sea, the battery terminals get corroded faster than normal and apparently something inside got corroded as well since operation now unreliable.The compact size is great.  The auto-off timer is rather annoying since the factory setting can not be changed and to make it through a ball game, the radio must be turned back on a couple of times.  I found the supplied ear buds to be uncomfortable but used them anyway --- the jack is smaller than normal.BOTTOM LINE:  The radio worked good enough that I am now ordering another one from Amazon at a savings of more than $20 when compared to what I paid for the orginal one.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1137110400, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2006"}
