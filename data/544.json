Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading, one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won't start due to a low battery level, requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. I've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years; if this thing suffers from a battery problem, then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago. Keep away.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bad battery or possibly false claims of reading hours on one charge", "unixReviewTime": 1385424000, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2013"}
