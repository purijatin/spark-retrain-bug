I might as well say it, I've had my current Sangean radio (DT-300-VW) for 7 years - that's 7 years of extensive use 8-12 hours a day x 4-5 days+ a week.  While all other radios I've owned within this size range have long since 'given-up-the-ghost' (over 7 years ago), this puppy just keeps on working with the same reliability as day 1!  AM/FM/TV reception is quite remarkable as it always has.  Weather band has always been a little weak in some areas of Colorado - you can pick up several different stations if you are in the right area, which is pretty cool actually.  I would not give up this radio for anything else out there.  Just one question still haunts me - will this thing EVER die?  I hope not, but if it does, I'll get another Sangean.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Will this thing ever die?", "unixReviewTime": 1172966400, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2007"}
