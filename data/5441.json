I have it with me while commuting and bicycling. The reception is great in city or country. It was my best little friend on 9/11/2001 and for weeks after, when we had no idea what was going to happen next! I've owned one for a few years and through my rough and careless handling I broke it dead. Am buying a replacement today, however.The only drawback is that I have to keep the instructions around to remind me how to set the memory functions, but everyday use is easy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Small enough and good enough to have with you always", "unixReviewTime": 1011657600, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2002"}
