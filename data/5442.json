Both are small enough for a shirt pocket, perhaps with a bit of sag.The  weather band doesn't work very well, getting the same station on every  channel on my DT300VW.The DT200V can be operated in the dark; this is  impossible with the complex operation of the DT300VW.The performance  difference is most noticeable on the AM band, where the DT200V does  remarkably well in distance reception.The DT300VW uses AAA batteries  instead of AA, and has a (unusual) subminiature jack on the earphone jacks,  requiring an adapter (included) to use any other earphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Smaller than DT200V but less performance", "unixReviewTime": 948758400, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2000"}
