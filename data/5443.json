This should be radio design 101.A thousand versions of MP3 and Ipod type players. Numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers. Why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile. Radio Shack built a couple of version some 5 to 10 years ago and they were excellent. I have had 3 or 4 of them but all have now broken and RS no longer offers(they do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish). Could you imagine doing that on your television set with some 2 hundred channels? This seems such an obvious product instead of the 1001st version of another MP3 player. There are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walking(think postmen), going to the beach, working, hiking, camping etc. This is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that I can find. Again Radio Shack had such a unit some years ago(a couple of models--I would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at RS decided to no longer offer them). Sony has such a unit, but you can only listen via an earphone(not thru a speaker). Someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eating.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Why no direct push button tuning capability", "unixReviewTime": 1184889600, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2007"}
