Heavy gauge metal everywhere with no corners cut. It comes packed like it was china too with heavy styrofoam all around. I found a Reelcraft ceiling mount on another web site and it, too, is made to last. I would not hesitate to buy anything from this company as they obviously build their stuff for the commercial, every-day-use market. I've used it for quite awhile now and have nothing but good things to say about it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This reel is built like a tank!", "unixReviewTime": 1167782400, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007"}
