I've had the Reelcraft for some time now and you get  what you pay for.  This is a strong, reliable unit.  Mine is mounted on the ceiling of my garage.  For me that's a perfect location. But it can also be easily mounted to a wall or other location.Having worked as an electrician I can vouch for the fact that Reelcraft used quality (Hubbell) parts throughout.  This unit has a very strong spring that winds up 45 feet of 12/3 cord effortlessly.  The #12 wiring throughout really does make a difference.  Plug a good leaf blower into this unit vs a #16 gauge extension cord most of us have, and you'll feel the difference.A Tip:  Be sure that the unit is connected directly into an electrical outlet.  If, in order to locate the Reelcraft  in `your' best location,  you MUST use an extension cord, be sure it's made of #12 wiring.  No reason to have a Reelcraft that can do a great job if it has to suck power through a tiny extension cord straw.Update December 2010 - Unit still functioning perfectly.  Can recommend.Update March 2012 - Unit still hangs from my garage ceiling and works just fine.  Still recommend.Update January 2013 -  Unit in use for a few years now.  Not constant use that a mechanics service bay would see,  but home use.  Unit holding up like new.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You Get What you Pay For", "unixReviewTime": 1251936000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2009"}
