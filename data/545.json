But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries. The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle, as on the kindle, pressing the home button brings us back to the library. On the Nook, the home button opens a menu, then you need to select the options. Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer. Overall, it's a good companion to Kindle, especially if you wish to borrow library books.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good reader that works well to borrow public library e-books", "unixReviewTime": 1402444800, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2014"}
