About the same time, I purchased an almost equivalent version from Home Depot, but with larger wire.  This is 16/3 and the one I have is 14/3 or 12/3.  This one works well and my other one doesn't.  The HD version's wire gauge is large enough that it won't retract fully, unless you wind it PERFECTLY.  I have to \"coax\" it in for the last 2 feet on a good day and pull it back out an rewind it atleast once when is starts sticking with 7+ feet out.  This version retracts fully, with no fuss.  I'm really happy with the performance.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Uses the correct wire gauge", "unixReviewTime": 1162252800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2006"}
