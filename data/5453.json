Within about 6 months the center plug somehow got bent inside so I can't plug anything into that one anymore. After 10 months the lock stopped working so when it's extended I have to put something on the cord to keep it from reeling back in.  I should also add at this point the cord may have been pulled out a couple dozen times at most.Update - I opened it up today to see if I could get the lock to work again. Turns out there are 2 plastic cogs that work together and one is mounted on a rivet. It had gotten a little bit bent so straightening it out seems to have fixed the problem. I also cranked the spring up another revolution so it retracts a little more forcefully and all the way to the end. Easy repair with a screwdriver and pair of pliers.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Worked great for 6 months", "unixReviewTime": 1399248000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014"}
