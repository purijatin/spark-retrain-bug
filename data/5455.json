I actually purchased one from Sears when they were offering it for $18 and some change. The construction is identical but the one from Sears does not have a circuit breaker, to me that's not a big deal.  Other then that so far it works like I expected it to.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Can find it cheaper", "unixReviewTime": 1372550400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2013"}
