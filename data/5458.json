It is too big for the pocket.  Well, it would fit but then the lock would have to be used so the buttons didn't get pushed and then the stations cannot be changed.If you want a clip you have to put the radio into this cheesy plastic thing that has a clip.  It looks super cheap and not what was expected for a Sangean.  That clip was a hassle to use so it was gone in a minute.I bought this radio hoping for one that was more convenient to wear at the desk and walking around and on walks without thinking about the radio.CONs:It takes two button pushes to change the station to your next PREset.  What?!I thought it would be smaller than it is so read the dimensions closely.No built in clip.I have two other Sangean radios that I love.  Oh well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Eh, OK", "unixReviewTime": 1269993600, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2010"}
