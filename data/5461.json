The mini stereo jack finally broke and put it out of commission. Since none of the other Japanese firms produce such products anymore, I started hunting around in Amazon and other web retailers.I chose this unit based on price and on other reviews by other buyers.  Although it is no where near as small as the Toshiba was (which was exactly the same size as a 6 credit cards in a stack) this unit performs the same while adding digital and memory tuning.  It is very sensitive in both the FM and AM bands and provides very good sound using any decent stereo headphone. I use 2 pairs of Sony headphones fit in my ears so that they do not fall or move about while I jog at White Plains, NY HS track.  The ear bud headphones supplied by Sangean sound great but would fall out while I ran.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": ":: Sensitive tuner and high quality sound  ::", "unixReviewTime": 1008547200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2001"}
