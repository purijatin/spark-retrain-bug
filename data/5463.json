I have several Sangean radios, and every one of them--let's see, I believe it is 5 different models BEFORE this one, 2 of one model and 3 of another, plus one each of 3--every one is aces!I'm sure there are some Sangeans that would not be a good fit for me, but so far I haven't bought one that wasn't. I read the specifications and the reviews very closely, and a lot of times! before deciding to order one.This radio, like the 5 different models I got before it, came well packed. The instructions are great. The features are excellent. It is well made, sounds just like I need for it to sound, has the functions I need, is a great size and shape--it's just great.I only got this today, got it working in just a few minutes, and I'm looking forward to having it for a long time. I walk, don't run, and will be very careful not to drop it. I have it in the case it comes in, and that fits fine in my pocket.A home run, Sangean!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding!", "unixReviewTime": 1303171200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2011"}
