Munro", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This is a nice little radio - compact, gets very good reception for me, has good bass response and is quite light.  It fits easily in a shirt pocket.Of course the ear buds that came with it are trash.  But that's the same with every audio device you buy - shouldn't be a real shocker to anyone in this day and age of mp3 players, iPod's, personal devices etc., that you're paying for the device, not the ear buds.  Just realize that going in and buy yourself a decent set of earphones or earbuds at the same time you buy the unit.My major complaint is how the favorite station settings work.  Setting up your favorites is easy enough, but to listen to them, you have to click a \"recall\" button, then rapidly tune up or down to get to whichever station you want and click \"recall\" again before it resets to normal tuning mode.  If you want to go to another favorite station, you again have to click \"recall\" but this time, instead of starting on the station you were last on, it goes to the bottom of the list, so you (again) have to scroll all the way through your favorites.  I like it much better on their other radios - like the Sangean DT-400W, where you just click a favorites button and you can then scroll at will and when you turn the power off and on again, the station is what you left it with last.  This constant business of hitting the recall button, then repeatedly scrolling through your list, hitting the recall button again, is quite annoying.What otherwise would be a 5 star rating gets 2 stars knocked off as a result.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good radio with clunky favorites operation", "unixReviewTime": 1341532800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2012"}
