In simple terms, this makes weak stations sound stronger.  (Sony Walkmans no longer offer a mono switch).  Otherwise, this digital radio tuner has functioned very well for me during my many long walks over the past couple of years.  A minor downside of this unit is the fact that it is a little bulky, requiring 2 AAA batteries.  Also, the \"ear-buds\" were worthless (and painful), but easily replaced by $9 Panasonic headphones.  The station preset selection controls are complicated and non-intuitive, and the instruction manual is hard to understand.  But this is a good tuner, and I do recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Digital AM/FM Tuner with Mono/Stereo Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1230422400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2008"}
