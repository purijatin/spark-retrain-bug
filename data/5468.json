Now I have bought a third DT100, and I see this model has been discontinued.My first DT 100 was bought from CCRANE. I used this radio until I accidentally killed the radio by dropping it.My second DT110 lasted for years, and was damaged when I shipped my belongings cross country to Washington. So I bought the Sony Walkman SRF-M37V.The Sony had pre-sets, and similar size. The Sony also has Weather, and TV audio.The sound quality of the Sony was always a disappointment.The band button is a real problem.The Sony eats aaa batteries.The Sony has no 90 minute off switch to save batteries.The Sony has no lock switch that prevents the assorted buttons from doing their thing. The ^}*=##{ band button is on the front of the radio.I primarily listen via a pillow speaker, and some times I accidentally hit the stupid band button and my station is gone until I turn the lights back on and find out which band I have wandered into.The Sangean 110 had AWESOME sound quality. Almost as good as CD on strong stations. I would recommend that you toss the ear buds that comes with the radio ang get Marshmallow or Skull Candy headphones, and the sound quality will surpass your ecpectations.In closing bye bye Sony! I'M GOING BACK TO SANGEAN!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "LOVED THIS RADIO.", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}
