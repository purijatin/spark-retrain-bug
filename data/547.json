What I  love about Nook more than kindle , that I could pick any Russian book, magazine  on Internet download on my computer , convert to PD format and download on Nook + I could pick on Nook any size of letters for comfortable reading .. On Kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you Bought ebook on Kindle store. Other PD format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which I find uncomfortable  Like I said with Nook no problem. Also touch screen work great too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great product !", "unixReviewTime": 1358294400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2013"}
