After seeking through the entire SW band three different times, at different times of the day and night, all I got was  BBC, and that only once, and some religious broadcasts.  I would have been  very happy to get stations from just Canada and Mexico, but no such luck.  It's a very nice AM/FM radio with some spiffy features like a sleep timer,  but my hope was to receive international broadcasts, and I am returning it  because it simply did not do that.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A big disappointment", "unixReviewTime": 947030400, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2000"}
