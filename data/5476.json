I have a large selection of radios and love to do compares and share my thoughts. This radio is good for the casual listener who doesn't want to spend a lot of money but would like to hear some SW along with AM/FM . The FM section is the best part of this radio .The AM section is filled with images and noise for the DXers out there . For local AM its pretty good.The built in sound and sound slection modes are surpisingly good. The overall construction and quality is fair at best and the radio is a battery hog . The SW section is fair. If you want to hear the big broadcasters , ok , anything else is static. There is no fine tuning . The YB300 and the Eton e 100 are far better for tuner sensativity and battery life.Its not a bad radio but others are better. How about 2 and half stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for the casual listener - better radios out there for the $$", "unixReviewTime": 1069632000, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2003"}
