Jesse Imbach \"Herr Chef-san\"", "helpful": [13, 13], "reviewtext": "I have owned this particular model of Sangean, as well as several others, for a number of years.  Sangean radios, in my experience, have excellent sound (for their size), have great reception, and are quite easy to use.I listen to classical music, international news, and domestic news while at my home in radio/tv/cellphone no-mans land.  Only the Sangeans work up here.  Our pretty little Grundig Porsche radio has to live at the city house to be useful.Back to the 606 - the metal and plastic case of the 606 is quite solid, handsome, and compact.  The built-in stand is both very convenient and angles the radio perfectly for easy viewing of the LCD at counter/table/desk height.The sound quality is terrific, considering it is a single driver of maybe 2.5&quot;.  Sound is full, dynamic, lively, remarkably rich, and very fast.  Bass is lacking, as you would expect over a radio with such a small driver.The 606 has one nasty habit, which is that if you plug it in, and it has batteries in it, it will drain the batteries instead of using the wall power.  You must take the batteries out of it before it will use the AC. Mine is a fairly early one (it uses the european power adapter with a US adapter on it), so this may have been fixed.As mantioned, this is my 6th or so Sangean, and the whole line is well built (except perhaps the 322) and they all sound great. I highly recommend them all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So very close to perfect...", "unixReviewTime": 1083283200, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2004"}
