It recently has been bumped from that position by the Kaito KA1102(see my review on the Kaito). Both receivers offer excellent AM FM and Shortwave performance, including STEREO to earphones.The choice between the two radios hinges on features, price and desire for ease of use.Sangean offers Long wave reception, Kaito does not.Kaito has Single sideband mode (for Hams), Sangean does not.Humane alarm of Sangean is less \"jarring\".Sangean in MUCH easier to use/Manual is easy to understand.Kaito is cheaper but feels more solidly built.Sangean has rotary volume control, Kaito has up/down buttons.\"batteries included\" on Kaito (NiMH rechargeable).Both are pretty amazing for their size!!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Pocket Sw Radio from Sangean", "unixReviewTime": 1141776000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2006"}
