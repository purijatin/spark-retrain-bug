FM reception is un-equaled by any other radio I have, plus very good AM and SW sensitivity.  Many more features than the YB400.  Very decent sound from the speaker and superb sound from a good pair of headphones.  The Yacht Boy might sound a little better (the speaker is at least twice the size), but I still love playing with this little gem.There are characteristics about all radios that each individual would like to have in their ideal radio and you can read a few of those in the other reviews.  However, I personally can't think of anything I wish were different about this radio, other than I wouldn't take it to the beach and expose it to the salt air.  Otherwise, it goes everywhere. It's also the radio I use most often in the house.  And for the price you can get it for, it's more than worth it.I guess instead of just repeating a lot of what has already been written, I'll just say I've bought three!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite radio", "unixReviewTime": 1116374400, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2005"}
