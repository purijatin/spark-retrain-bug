I needed a radio to replace my Sony SW-1. I live in the California central valley between Fresno and Bakersfield, the radio reception here is horrible and I like to go to sleep with the radio on and ear plugs in. With my Sony I could get fair Am/Fm and SW. With the Sangean I get great Am/Fm and SW. I get stations on the Sangean that were nothing but static on the Sony. It's a little bigger than my Sony but has some great features the sony didn't. Like setting the length of time before it turns off and the auto station select (I used it for FM, I like all kinds of music).The handy display light that turns off after 30 seconds. And to pull in those weak stations, a simple button to change to the fine tune mode. Also handy is the lock button that locks the front pannel (It keeps me from changing the station by bumping the buttons while falling asleep) If you don't mind a big radio and want one for AM get a CC radio. If you want a small radio to travel with or a small radio for your night stand, this is the best for the price.Pros: Great reception, easy to use, small, comes with a nice leather case, ear plugs, external antenna and ac adapter.Cons: No wrist strap.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sangean WOW what a radio!!", "unixReviewTime": 1010102400, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2002"}
