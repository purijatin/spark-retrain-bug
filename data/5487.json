The Sangean 606 is by far the best.  It has all the standard Sangean features - a digital clock, automatic radio turn-off after 60, 45, 30, or 15 minutes, radio and beeper alarms, fine tuning, band scanning, automatic tuning, a tuning light, a faintly lit display window, and a shortwave frequency range of 1.711 MHz to 29.999.  This last feature is what I most like about the 606.  Compact or pocket shortwave radios often compromise on the frequency range; but not the 606.The reception of the AM, FM, and shortwave bands - considering the small size of this radio (5 3/4\" x 3 3/8\") - is very good.  Its physical body seems to be solid, although the tuning buttons are a bit delicate.  The speaker tone is somewhat tinny, of course, but not unusually so for a radio of this size.  There are no tone adjustment controls, nor does it have SSB capability.  A power adapter and reel antenna are included.Overall, the 606 is very easy to master, since its design is intuitive; it's also attractive and extremely portable in its small flexible pouch.  The price is rather high, but a good radio costs money.I recommend the Sangean ATS 606 as a simple high-quality compact multi-band radio for travelling and hiking.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High Quality Compact Shortwave Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1244592000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2009"}
