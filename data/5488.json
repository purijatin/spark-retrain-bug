Dollar for dollar pound for pound this is one of the best buys out there . It is compact and great for travel or listening in bed . It has and excellent tuner on all bands . It has a suprisingly excellent sound from the built in speaker . It has full SW coverage with a 1kh tuning increment which is essential for serious DXers . It is functionally laid out well .  Really couldn't ask for more in a light weight compact multi-band . It far out performs the Sony SW35 and 40 and the Grundig YB300 and 400 which is in the same price range . Also , Radio Shack carried this radio under their name ( RS DX-399 ) and has recently held clearance sales where this little gem was selling at a great discount . If you see it buy it , its a must do!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Little Powerhouse !!", "unixReviewTime": 1066953600, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2003"}
