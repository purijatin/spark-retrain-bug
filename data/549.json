The rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up.  The only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about 20 seconds.***Update*** About a month after the warranty expired, the screen froze up permanently.  I haven't been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when I called tech support, the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isn't working to unfreeze the screen anymore.  When it worked, I really liked it.  I just wish that it still worked.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Somewhat Glitchy", "unixReviewTime": 1347580800, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2012"}
