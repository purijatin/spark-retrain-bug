This little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its 12 bands. Moreover, it is quite easy to use. Sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable.  The automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals.  Selectivity is quite good, but one could use a larger tuning knob (or I suppose in my case, smaller fingers) to make those fine adjustments easier. The size of the radio makes it easy to pack.Although you get a lot of radio for a few dollars, it would have been nice if Sangean had included an AC adaptor.  I have used this radio a lot since I purchased it, and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume.  Accordingly, I purchased an AC adaptor for it.  I tried several adaptors before I settled on the Radio Shack 4.5 volt &quot;International&quot; model (cat. no. 273-1759).  This device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered, regulated DC. Unlike other adaptors I tried, this one is relatively &quot;quiet.&quot;  It does not induce hum or electrical noise.  Best of all, it folds up in a very small travel package.If you don't want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio, but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel, the SG622 should work well for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1001548800, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2001"}
