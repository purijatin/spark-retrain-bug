It can tune 10 shortwave broadcast bands but none of the ham or utility frequencies between.Its performance on all bands is decent, especially compared to other small portables.  It covers more shortwave bands than many.  Sound is not great, but again, it's good compared to others in this class.I would recommend it as a radio to pack along on trips.  It works fairly well and can be had cheaply enough that if it were lost or stolen it wouldn't ruin your life.  It would also be good for those, including the visually impaired, who have difficulty running a general coverage set with a digital display.  Or for those who just don't want to.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of the best of its class", "unixReviewTime": 1107993600, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2005"}
