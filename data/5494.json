You will be impressed by the high fidelity output from the internal speaker.  There are 10 SW bands and an additional 2 for am/fm so there's plenty of content.  Overall, the radio feels solid, antenna and knobs are good quality.  It is powered by 3 AA batteries but also will run on an a 4.5 volt adapter (not included).  Range and performance of this SW radio rivals units costing much more.  A great choice for getting into SW and it's price won't set you back.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Quality Short Wave at an affordable price", "unixReviewTime": 1074816000, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2004"}
