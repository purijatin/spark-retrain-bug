I live 30 miles outside of Chicago, so I'm not in one of  the most challenging areas, such as in the loop or in downtown NY. The FM band could only reach the very strongest stations, and not the weaker ones as I'd hoped. I guess it comes down to this: that you get what you pay for. This inexpensive radio was unremarkable; as matter of fact I actually couldn't receive that many Shortwave stations either.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a bit of a disapointment", "unixReviewTime": 1039996800, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2002"}
