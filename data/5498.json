I am new to shortwave listening and am so far impressed with what I have found so far with this radio, but it doesn't seem to have great selectivity. Every station I have heard so far has at last 2 or 3 other stations bleeding into it, which makes it difficult to listen to certain stations sometimes. But for its tiny size and low price, it is a good deal.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good For Size And Price", "unixReviewTime": 1001721600, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2001"}
