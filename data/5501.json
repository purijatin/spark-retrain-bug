It'll will bring in the higher-power shortwave  stations:  BBC, Radio Netherlands, Radio Japan etc.  Sound quality is quite  good.  Like most analog radios, knowing what frequency you are on is  impossible, but for casual tuning, or to get a taste of what shortwave has  to offer, this radio is fine. It's also small and light enough to make a  decent travel portable (and cheap enough that if you lose it, it's not the  end of the world.) And, its a good radio to toss into your emergency  preparedness kit.It will perform better with an external antenna  &quot;boost&quot; - just take a 10'-30' piece of wire, attach a couple of  alligator clips, and save yourself $15 by not buying a &quot;reel in&quot;  antenna.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good second/portable/emergency radio", "unixReviewTime": 958176000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2000"}
