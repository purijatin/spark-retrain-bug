Somehow, it is still great fun to use!Band scanning has been a weak point of digital radios... the sound is usually muted while slewing through the frequency range, leaving just a tuning indicator light to show that a station has been found (most will not stop scanning on weak signals), or if not muted, a loud \"chuffing\" noise is produced as the frequencies are scanned. With this set you just turn the knob and listen for stations!If you want to easily find, say the BBC on 5.975 Mhz a digital radio will get you there much faster, but for scanning the band to see what is on, the old dial and pointer still works quite well!For a similar but smaller and slightly less expensive radio, see my review of the Kaito WRX911. For a more expensive radio with \"Double Conversion\", which eliminates \"false signals\" on shortwave, see my review of the Kaito KA1107.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun Radio for \"tuning around\" on Shortwave", "unixReviewTime": 1141776000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2006"}
