Though small, this radio has great reception of regular and shortwave channels, without any sort of cumbersome antenna wire to deal with.  The batteries last a long, long time, even when I fell asleep and left it on all night a couple times.  Just don't break the antenna off right away, which I always seem to do!  Anyone would have fun with this.  (Oh, and it's VERY sturdy.  I actually did a human cannonball thing, diving face first onto mine, when holding onto the dog's leash as it saw a cat, and though I got a black eye, the radio was unscathed and still working great.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Makes a good present....", "unixReviewTime": 1163030400, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2006"}
