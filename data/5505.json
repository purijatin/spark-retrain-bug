It compares to my RCA globetrotter that gets good am reception. The performance is better then the radioshack 20-125 whitch has synthesyzer or display noise whitch sucks not to mention that it mutes while scanning so if your blind do knot get this radio. The sangean is easy to use and if connected to a fence with wire shortwave performance gets even better. Becarfull with the tuning becuss it can break[mine did] so i ordered another one.
