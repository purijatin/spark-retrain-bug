The tuning failed to work well within several weeks. It is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weather...even 50's...it loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible. And yes, the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others. Reception of FM and Am are pretty good. There is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station. So, if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics aren't a bother this might be an acceptable choice...but radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical parts...it's a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choice.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "electronics OK but mechanical tuning and volume poorly made", "unixReviewTime": 1258243200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2009"}
