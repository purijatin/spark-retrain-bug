Lanthier", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewtext": "I bought this radio hoping that it would improve reception in an interior bathroom where I take my morning shower. I like to listen to a local news station, traffic, weather etc, but we live in a very tough reception area near a tower that broadcasts many foreign language (mostly Korean and Spanish, I think) local stations that seem to overwhelm cheap a cheap radios' tuning ability. I have rarely been able to pull in our (WTOP, Washington, DC) local AM news station, but this radio does a fine job. Yes, it does indeed have an AM band (labeled as MW), contrary to some reviews, and does a great job. Sound is quite good, and the unit is small, though not tiny, and surpringsly heavy for its size (i.e. SOLID).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tough reception area...", "unixReviewTime": 1094256000, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2004"}
