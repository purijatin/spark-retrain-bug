Stein \"TALK SHOW JUNKIE\" writes:>> despite the advertising there is NO AM BAND ON THIS RADIO!!This is quite untrue.  This radio has AM Band, it is however labeled as \"MW\" (as opposed to being labeled \"AM\").  \"MW\" stands for \"Medium Wave\" and is just another name for \"AM\" (which stands for Amplitude Modulation).  Although labeled differently, it is quite obvious once one uses this radio that MW are the AM stations.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It *does* have AM Band (a response to \"false info\")", "unixReviewTime": 1152921600, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2006"}
