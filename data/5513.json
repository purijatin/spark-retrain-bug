The reception is surprisingly good for something so small and portable.  It's attractive enough enough that I can leave it in the guest bedroom, on the nightstand for the use of my guests, and small enough that I can take it with me when I travel.Naturally you're not going to get a lot of power out of it, but I've had much larger, more expensive shortwave units which performed at about the same level, so I have no complaints with the Sangean.  It was a good buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Surprising", "unixReviewTime": 1135555200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2005"}
