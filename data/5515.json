The radio has a very good sound from the built in speaker and the tuner on AM/FM and SW seem to be pretty good . I have compared this radio to the popular Sony sw11 which is Sony's analog mulitband equivalent ...the Sangean has much better sound and about the same level of selectivity from the tuner . The Sangean is also about $20 cheaper . My only knock on this radio is that even though the tried to keep the price down a telescoping antenna would have been nice . Other than that no real complaints . A very good buy !", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good radio for beginners /nice price", "unixReviewTime": 1069027200, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2003"}
