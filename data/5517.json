This radio is very high quality, solid and precise. The SW on low/high band is very efficient and sound is very good. As one should understand, any radio is as good as radio conditions are. The time, weather, solar activity they all affect SW waves. If you know what you do and have a good antenna this radio outperforms anything in reachable price range. The memory banks (231 of them) are very well organized, allow banks and automatic scanning through the range and auto selection through the bank frequencies. This is one very smart radio. I purchased mine in 2001 and still no other radio can challenge this brick despite near 8 years have passed since.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My best radio ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1216684800, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2008"}
