It sounds good and has a plethora oftuning features.  But, it is expensive and offers only mediocreperformance for the money.For a bunch less cash you can have a more sensitive, moreportable radio, the Sony SW7600GR.  While it doesn't soundas nice as the Sangean, it will pull in many more signals,has better SSB performance, plus has Synchronous Detectionwhich locks in signals and reduces noise and interference.Amazon's price on the Sony is almost $100 US less than theSangean.  The Sony is the absolute best value in this classof receiver.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Radio, but there's better for less...", "unixReviewTime": 1102636800, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2004"}
