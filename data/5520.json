Excellent sw sensitivity, good am and excellent fm as well....considering the ATS 909's rather small size. Sound is quite good, too, for it's size. And it's got a fine assortment of settings/buttons for improved performance.The big problem was that it didn't hold up well over the long haul. Firstly, the numbers/letters on the buttons that I used most often rubbed off, including the silver paint underneath, and became totally illegible. Then, about a year and a half after purchase, the digital clock refused to hold the correct time. I had it repaired but the clock went bad once again a few months later. And lastly, the speaker went bad, giving only fuzzy, low fidelity sound. It's now, essentially, unusable.Were it not for the abovementioned problems, I'd rate it five stars. At the fairly high selling price of around $250, the ATS 909 should hold up for a lot longer than it did.I guess that these days, quality and durability of most electronic goods just aren't as competent as they once were.....sigh.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A Fine Performer, But Sadly, Didn't Hold Up Very Well", "unixReviewTime": 1198627200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2007"}
