Of the three I would give the ATS-909 the lowest score. It definitely lacks the sensitivity of the other two. (Though connecting an external antenna helps greatly but defeats the purpose of a portable radio.) And I find the audio quality to be muddled and tiring to listen to.If you're looking for a good portable I would also recommend the Grundig YB400 or the new Sony ICF-7600GR.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Adequate but not exceptional", "unixReviewTime": 993686400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2001"}
