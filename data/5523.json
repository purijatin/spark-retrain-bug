There are better models, but for this price, it's second to none. Good sensitivity, adequate selectivity (ability to separate  signals from one another) and lots of bells and whistles.  Covers all the  shortwave specturm.  Numerous ways to tune stations, the best of which is  the keypad input.  Digital readout eliminates guesswork as to what  frequency you're on.  FM tends to overload in urban areas with lots of FM  signals.  The only real downside to this radio is it can be pretty  complicated to operate.  Plan on spending some time going through the  manual and figuring out all the features.If you live outside of Europe  or the east coast of North American, you'll likely need to use an external  antenna.  30 feet of wire with alligator clips on each end should do the  trick.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Probably the best under $300 radio you'll find.", "unixReviewTime": 958176000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2000"}
