Needless to say, the radio assumed room temperature:)  It gave up the ghost!  However, it is definately solidly built and is absolutely loaded with almost every feature a shortwave listener would want... even SSB (single sideband) reception by using a built in BFO (beat frequency oscillator switch for upper... and lower sideband!  RF gain switch  is handy when you're close to an a.m. station.  With headphones you can listen to stereo FM.  Get this radio if you are serious about shortwave... and get the portable roll up antenna for really improving SW reception.  This radio has my very highest recommendatiion!  OH... I am getting a new one sometime soon to replace the one that went airborne for about a second!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best portable radio under $300", "unixReviewTime": 1297728000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2011"}
