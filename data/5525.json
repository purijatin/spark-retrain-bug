After having and using the ATS-909 for a full week I am 100% happy with it. My other (quality) receiver is a Grundig Satellit 800, that I had bought refurbished two years ago. The ATS-909 has much better sensitivity than my Grundig with a 50 foot long wire antenna at 15.000 Mhz where I just compared them.The Grundig is better, with its built in whip antenna, but the ATS-909 comes in a respectable second there, in my book.It also has the best sound I have ever heard from a radio this size. SSB sounds better than some HAM rigs I have listened to.Mine came with an AC adapter and 23 foot, windup, long wire antenna. I use NiMh 2700 MhA rechargable batteries, so the adapter is not necessary for me.Excellent portable SW/AM/FM receiver, I am happy!Ken", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "20+ Years of SWL.
