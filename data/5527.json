When I read about the 909, it seemed to me like the definitive portable (I don't like the 'other definitive, Sony 2100).  So, I bought it from Amazon (good price and  reliable store) and as soon as it was delivered to me I benchmarked it  against the first radio I got on hand: a modest fifteen years old Phillips  COMPASS. Well, to my surprise, the Phillips showed twice as sensitive as  the Sangean. Even with the sangean's whip full extended, and the Phillips'  one totally folded, the Phillips clearly outperformed the 909. When  switched to an external antenna, the Sangean improved 100%, but the point  is, what a portable means? why such a good radio performs so poor with such  a long whip antenna? If you need the receiver to carry it around while  travelling, then check the Sony 7600g or grundig YB400PE (both with  superior performance as portable). Otherwise, with an ext. antenna, the  radio is an excellent all-kind-of-features receiver. The FM capture is  superb, as well as the SSB legibility. The sound is quite good, even if not  as good as the grundig's.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Poor SW sensitivity with supplied whip antenna.", "unixReviewTime": 952819200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2000"}
