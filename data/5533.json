I love to do compares . The Sangean 909 is a very very good radio . The tuner is of top quality and the overall performance is consistant with the Sony 7600 . This radios best quality is its construction and the sound quality . It has the best built in speaker I have ever heard in a \" portable \" radio . It is very durable but a bit heavy in weight . It is loaded with extras like a line out , ext antenna jack and a really nice SSB set up . The AM and SW sections are very good . In its class the only better radio is the Sony 7600 because of its outstanding tuner , however , the tuner in the 909 is very good. All in all the 909 is probably the best all around radio in its class due to the sound quality and the diverse functionality ( extensive memory and a wonderful visual display window ) . Its a little expensive and as I stated before a bit heavy but a great radio .", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good quality , lots of functionality , great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1067299200, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2003"}
