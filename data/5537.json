Lessnau", "helpful": [12, 12], "reviewtext": "I've been using this switch non-stop for over two years now and have never had any kind of problem.  It's a great little switch that's definitely worth the money.  All the ports are in the back, the casing has a brushed aluminum look, and it's fanless, so it's definitely possible to leave it sitting on the desk.  Since the \"switching fabric\" supports 1GB/sec, that means each of the five ports can carry their full 200MB/sec (100MB/sec each way) capacity without problem.  The darn thing doesn't even get warm.  Definitely a good buy (I rate it at 5 stars out of 5).One note:  If I were to buy another switch today, I'd probably go for the 10/100/1000 version of the same switch (the D-Link DGS-1005D).  Darn near every computer sold these days has a Gigabit Ethernet connection built into it.  So, having that switch would most likely let people take advantage of the added speed on their local networks (assuming they had Cat 5e or Cat 6 cabling -- however, it wouldn't make any difference across the internet since only a rare few cable modem even connect at 100Mb/sec and I don't know of any that connect at 1 GB/sec).  But, since that switch costs about twice as much as this one, there's a bit of a trade-off.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent 5-Port 10/100 Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1124668800, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2005"}
