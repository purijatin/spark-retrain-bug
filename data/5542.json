I was a little surprised at first because it is only a little larger than the size of a deck of cards.  So I took out the included AC adapter and plugged it into the hub and into my powerstrip.  Then I plugged the included USB cable into my computer's USB port and into the hub.  Windows 98 recognized the new hardware and installed it with the Windows 98 CD in about twenty seconds.  Then I plugged in my IntelliMouse Optical and my Intel Camera and Windows installed them as well and I was all set.  Five minutes after opening the box!So these are the great things about it.1. Easy to install: literally five minutes.2. Great size: not much larger than a deck of cards.3. Great price: PCI USB ports cost twice as much.4. Works great: four devices can be plugged into the space of one of your computers USB ports.A Great Buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to Install, Great Small Size, Great Price, Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 977961600, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2000"}
