So, I decided to give the D-Link a try.  I powered down my Hewlett Packard running Windows ME and installed the new hardware.  I chose to use the optional AC Power adapter, because I was hooking up the &quot;Viking - Intelliflash smart card reader&quot; and wanted to ensure enough power.Upon rebooting Windows ME automatically recognized the product and installed the required driver.  I verified the installation under &quot;control panel/system/universal serial bus controllers.&quot;  It was newly listed as a &quot;general purpose USB hub.&quot;  I can't imagine anyone having problem adding this hub to his or her existing system.I give it a perfect 5 for ease of installation and excellent value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to Install", "unixReviewTime": 982886400, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2001"}
