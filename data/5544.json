Allen \"C A\"", "helpful": [28, 28], "reviewtext": "When the number of USB devices here exceded the number of ports on my Dell Dimension, I shopped around for a 4 port USB hub. This unit looked appealing; not only did it come with a 6 foot USB cable, it could be powered by the computer USB port or from it's own wall wart power supply.  When it arrived, it was an easy and straight forward install. Plug the supplied cable into the hub, plug the hub into the computer's USB port, plug the devices into the hub, you're done.  Turning the computer's power on, five LEDs lit up green.  One LED for each port and one showing the hub is running from the computer's power supply. A red LED lights to show when the HUB's wall wart is supplying the power.  Elegant simplicity in a translucent package, the most difficult thing to expect in setting this up is opening the blister pack to get at it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Inexpenisive and easy to install powered 4 port USB hub", "unixReviewTime": 992995200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2001"}
