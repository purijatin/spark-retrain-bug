Soares", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I bought this hub several months ago and I am extremely pleased with its performance and looks.  I am very pleased with its esthetic looks due to the clear case.  One nice surprise was the fact that included with the USB hub was a power cable.  This allows the hub to power the devises instead of siphoning power from your computer's motherboard.  This helps keep your power hungry devices happy.  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good USB hub not only for its esthetics but for also its supreme performance for such a great price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An awesome product", "unixReviewTime": 970358400, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2000"}
