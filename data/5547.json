For the most part, I was very satisfied with the hub when I was only using a couple of USB devices going into the hub.However, I recently bought a USB CD-RW. On top of a printer, USB keyboard, etc. the CD-RW was just too much. I agree with the other reviewer, just spend an extra few bucks and get a robust hub that will last you a while, through multiple upgrades.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Cheap hub - Cheap Results", "unixReviewTime": 988675200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2001"}
