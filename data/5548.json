Windows simply will not recognize this device.  I work in a Tech Support center and have fairly in-depth technical skills.  I've also had other technically adept people look at it, with same results.  I'll try Belkin or Linksys now but I'd steer clear of this item.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Cheap piece of junk", "unixReviewTime": 1013126400, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2002"}
