While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of the other Ebook Readers, it does exactly what it is meant to do. It allows you to read books. I bought this as gateway into ebook technology and I love it. The unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy. The buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages. It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Ebook Reader", "unixReviewTime": 1371340800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2013"}
