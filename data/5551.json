No more fumbling in the back of your PC box to pull out the USB connector of an accessory you are not using to plug in one you want to use.  The connections are in the front of the Dlink box.  Good price compared to Linksys, Belkin and other competitive models.  I am quite happy I bought this hub.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Just as Advertised", "unixReviewTime": 1003363200, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2001"}
