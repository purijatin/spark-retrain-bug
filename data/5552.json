I just plugged it in and instantly forgot about it!  I was a bit skeptical because most USB hubs tend to be a bit pricier, but the D-Link hub works great and it can't get any easier to set it up.  I love the compact design as well.  This one is definately a no-brainer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast &amp; Easy", "unixReviewTime": 998006400, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2001"}
