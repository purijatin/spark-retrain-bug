I was suprised how much USB hubs go for, and this one represents an incredible value for someone who just wants a simple small USB hub.The hub itself is small and attractive, with lots of LEDs to light it up, and the now so popular translucent stlying.  Set up was a breeze, plug it in and your good to go.The hub also supports self-powered or bus-powered operation.  This means if like me your hooking up small low power devices to it, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLUG IT IN!The user guide is a little lacking, and the retail packaging is a little plain, but if you can live with that, this is an exceptional value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value for a USB hub", "unixReviewTime": 982713600, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2001"}
