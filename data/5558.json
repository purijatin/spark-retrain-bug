When I switched to a lighter Asante 4-port hub, I no longer had any problems.  Maybe the problem was in my USB cable, because the D-Link seems to be a solid, well-designed piece of equipment.  The price is right, so you could do worse than give it a try for yourself.The D-Link hub initially worked fine with my iMac for lighter tasks. But as Harry Carey would say whenever a fly ball fell short of the bleachers, one more biscuit for breakfast might have insured a home run. Lately I'm finding that heavy-duty print jobs involving photos are requiring me to unplug the printer from the hub and directly into the USB port of the computer. Occasionally, the unit causes everything to freeze when attached to its power supply, then resumes functionality when I unplug its electrical source (the instructions claim the unit is 5 times more powerful when run by electricity).  Fortunately, at these prices you can afford to just toss it and try something else.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bummer.", "unixReviewTime": 1010534400, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2002"}
