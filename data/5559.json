I've expanded my laptop's single USB port into four - quickly and easily.  Even though I had read some mixed reviews, my experience has been very positive so far!  You really don't need to spend more money on another hub - this one's a great value, reliable and is nice-looking too.  I wouldn't think twice about buying this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic!  Powerful Little Hub!  Recommend!", "unixReviewTime": 983145600, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2001"}
