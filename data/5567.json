Use with a mulitband radio that gets carried outside frequently. Compact size and long antenna make this unit very adaptable. I Velcro'd the case to the back of the radio for easy carrying. Pull the antenna out as far as necessary to get a signal. I found the antenna wire to be quite long and durable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Compact, very useful", "unixReviewTime": 1356825600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2012"}
