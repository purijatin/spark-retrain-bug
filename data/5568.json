It brings in the weak signals so I can hear what is broadcast - while listening I have disconnected and reconnected it to compare reception with using just the stock telescopic antenna and it makes a world of difference! I use it indoors on my Tecsun PL-380 but I have tried it outside and it does work even better outside. It may not be a super antenna but it really does a great job for improving reception and the price is great too!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Little Antenna!", "unixReviewTime": 1375315200, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2013"}
