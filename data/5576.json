You do not need to order it, unless you lose the antenna included in the box.  This improves the reception dramatically on SW.  It doesn't improve standard commercial a.m. reception very much, except at night.  The ATS-909X radio comes with this antenna AND the carrying case for the radio itself. The antenna itself is outstanding for its size! Very compact, rolls out and in very easily... just use the \"shuttle\" style knob to reel it back in!  It DOES improve the received signal considerably compared to the \"ship\" antenna. It DOES plug directly into the ATS-909X antenna jack.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is supposed to be in the ATS-909X box!!!
