Outdoors, I hung it from my 2nd story balcony. It brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna. For stations I could get in without it, the signal was cleaner and stronger. It worked better when plugged in than when clipped on (even though when clipped it still showed an improvement). It is very easy to reel in when done.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "3x as many stations outdoors!", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2013"}
