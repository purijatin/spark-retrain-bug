Duvernois", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewtext": "This isn't a magic shortwave-attracting antenna, it's a simple wire that can be plugged into the shortwave (if it has a jack) or clipped to the aerial if there's no antenna jack. Try a couple of different orientations and you can usually improve the reception of a handheld shortwave significantly. There is a similar Kaito antenna that is harder to wind back up, but is otherwise the same. I also have an older Sony-branded antenna that appears to be identical.This antenna is nice and portable, fits in my portable radio carrying case, and gives a decent boost to reception. It's not magic though and you could, in fine DIY fashion, hook up 20 feet of wire to your shortwave for much the same effect.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for what it is", "unixReviewTime": 1302480000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2011"}
