It's easy to use, but did not improve reception on any of my radios.  I tried using it on a shortwave radio, a weather radio, and a regular AM/FM radio.  I could not sense a difference in reception either with, or without, use of the antenna.  Sure, it could have to do with my geographical location or other factors.  But after three failed attempts on three different radios, I am sure that the antenna holds some degree of responsibility.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I Expected More...", "unixReviewTime": 1315440000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2011"}
