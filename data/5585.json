Both the S350DL and the mini300 are good radios for me.  The addition of this useful little accessory, this random wire, has made both radios even better receivers.In short, sometimes the additional antenna helps with reception, sometimes the effect is negligible, in a few instances it is best to disconnect the antenna.  In talking to a friend who is very knowledgeable about all things radio, this is what can be expected of this type of simple, easy to use, equipment.  I do use this antenna in conjunction with a grounding wire when using the S350DL, and I find the combination to be very effective.  The sensible adapter clip works fine with either radio's antenna.Were I to recommend any improvements to this product (I am doing so here), I'd suggest the addition of a sort of lock-in-place device, such as one often finds on tape measures, or fishing spools.  The strap is handy, but a hook of some sort off of the spool case would also be a useful feature.  Of course, one can fashion a hook and employ it with the strap to partially work around this.  These are suggestions from an \"indoor user\", stringing about windows and curtains where these sort of features would be quite useful, and the kind of user likely to gain in numbers over time.Overall, this is a very useful device for better SW listening.  I'd recommend this simple antenna to anyone who is looking for a way to easily improve SW reception. It's not a panacea for SW reception issues, but it certainly does help one's reception in a lot of circumstances.  The reasonable price and super saver delivery are also positive factors.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A very useful, simple accessory", "unixReviewTime": 1210550400, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2008"}
