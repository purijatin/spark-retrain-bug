I use another type of antenna I built for summer and outdoors but this antenna could be hung out a window and hung as high as possible. They say position to the North for best reception. Have to go to the Web and look up sw info. to location and time of year. I  really like that it plugs into the radio and has an adapter if needed to clip onto the antenna.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice indoor antenna", "unixReviewTime": 1371427200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2013"}
