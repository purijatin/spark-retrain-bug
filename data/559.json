It has traveled to England, Scotland, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar and has even taken a cruise! It has traveled around in a purse, a briefcase and a carryon. It has downloaded books in PDF as well as the e-pub format, from Barnes & Noble as well as other suppliers. It has borrowed and loaned books. It also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check e-mail or the latest news. This is one device that will never disappoint.So easy to read. A big plus is that when you search for a subject on B&N;, once it has exhausted the B&N; offerings (some free!), it goes on to list all the Google Books in the same category. If you make selections of Google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections. I love the way this all happens automatically. You don't have to do anything at all. You can also add audio books, other audio files. The approximately 1,500 book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Have had it more than a year-won't leave home without it!", "unixReviewTime": 1263686400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2010"}
