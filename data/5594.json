Even though there is really no gain, this antenna allows portability and the ability to have something outside away from inside walls and interference. Not bad for the money. This would also be great for a portable antenna to take with you on the go!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not bad for an external antenna", "unixReviewTime": 1401148800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014"}
