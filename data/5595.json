The Sangean ANT-60 does not make a substantial difference in this radio's reception. That said, there may be no fault with the Sangean antenna and criticism may not be warranted, It may be the telescoping antenna included with the PL-398BT is just that good. The Sangean ANT-60 does connect and work as advertised. There is no complaint on quality of build or ease of use.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sangean ANT-60 vs Tecsun PL-398BT Whip Antenna", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2013"}
