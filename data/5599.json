These are my experiences... Seagate didn't need firmware update.Packaging:WD was packaged very well with cushion padding where as Seagate was packed really lousy. I had ordered 2 drives in each brand and one of the seagate boxes looked like it was opened already (may be it was human error while packaging; I didn't bother).Noise:Seagate is noisier than WD but it is much smoother than WD. Meaning, WD produced lot of hard clicking sounds that really irritated me (both drives; may be just the two I received were defective). Clicking sounds from Seagate felt normal to me (and it was muffled).Heat:Seagate got much hotter than WD. I figured WD didn't produce as much as heat because it uses \"intelliseek\" that runs the motor at optimal/slower speeds rather than the advertised 7200rpm.Speed:I couldn't compare speed as I was running WD in RAID1 and Seagate as Standard drives.Overall, I am very happy with Seagate mainly because of its much smoother operation and brand reputation.Hope this review helps!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Smooth Barracuda!", "unixReviewTime": 1240876800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2009"}
