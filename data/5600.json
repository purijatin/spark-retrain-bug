Quintero", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewtext": "I was weary about getting this drive since I heard all the problems of loosing data and these drives going bad after a short time.  Don't believe the hype!!  I went ahead and bought it and installed it.  I went to the seagate knowledge base site, downloaded the firmware and followed the instructions on the site.  I updated the firmware and the drive has been running smooth and FAST!!I love the space for the OS and all the apps I have loaded.  The price is so good too that, I think I am going to buy another one so I can dump all my pics and music on to it separately. Or, maybe two so I can run a RAID setup.  Anyways, don't let the firmware problem scare you, this is a very good drive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this drive!!", "unixReviewTime": 1234828800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2009"}
