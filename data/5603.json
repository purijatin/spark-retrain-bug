It would be useful if seagate would proactively notify users about such danerous bugs in the firmware.  Also, if the drive is an OEM drive Seagate will not repair it nondestructively,  even if the problem is due to the faulty firmware.  If you buy a seagate it may be prudent to wait a few months to make sure that model is stable, since so many of their newer drives seems to be having firmeware and related issues.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "firmware issues", "unixReviewTime": 1249171200, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2009"}
