I bought it to replace a failed IOMega drive in an external USB case. The Seagate drive was fairly easy to install in the external case and the included software recognized and formatted the drive with no issues.***UPDATE***After reading another review, I checked my drive to see if it required a firmware update (the Seagate website has utilities to check) and it does. The update process is cumbersome.Not Recommended!CFH", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Would Have Picked A Different Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1233619200, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2009"}
