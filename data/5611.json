AMAZON was awesome and 'overnighted' me a replacement drive. I sent Amazon the request to replace the drive around 4:00 p.m. one day and the new one was in my hands around 10:00 a.m. the next morning. If that's not great service, I dpn't know what is. + after getting the replacement drive the remaining 2 drives work fantastic. Thanks, Amazon!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The ones that work are great.", "unixReviewTime": 1245024000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2009"}
