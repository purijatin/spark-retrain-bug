Cox \"Shanghaied\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewtext": "I bought this about six months ago when the price was much higher, but I still feel like I got an exceptional deal.  This had NCQ (native command queuing) that most drives do not.  That means when files are highly fragmented, the disk drive itself intelligently reads the files according to where they are positioned on the disk and then puts it back together before sending data to the computer.  The result is a faster disk than one that doesn't have this feature.  I had zero problems with this disk, unlike one of the 1.5 TB drives.  I had to send that one back for exchange and got one back that vibrates slightly.  So, I plan to purchase another 1 TB disk with NCQ to complement the one I have.  I may make it into a RAID configuration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Performance, Solid Reliability", "unixReviewTime": 1233964800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2009"}
