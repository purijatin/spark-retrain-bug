Seriously.I had three Seagate drives fail (the next replaced it's predecessor) in about a year's time.  If you're wondering, I work at a university and we're encouraged to buy through purchase orders locally.  And that meant Seagate.So three drives failed.  Yes, that counts as a statistical anomaly.  It deserves a fine googling.  Some people tried to tell me my computer case didn't have the proper air flow or that my external casing's power supply hurt the drive.  (NUH UH on each account).Other people pointed me out to a firmware problem with a large group of Seagate drives.  The drives can enter a limbo BSY state that bricks the drive even though physically there is nothing wrong with it.  It can be cured with a very technical low-level serial com with the controller board.  (Which I actually did for kicks.  It's kind of cool.)Seagate acknowledges the problem.  They have a serial number search.  Armchair quarterbacks estimate the failure is on 25% of their lineup.  Not sure.  Wouldn't take the chance.  They won't fix OEM drives.  They will do the low level repair thing for retail drives if your serial number comes up in their search page.This kind of mass failure of hard disks happened once before oddly enough.  It was with Hitachi/IBM's DeskStar lineup, properly monikered \"DeathStar.\"  Google it if you'd like.  But anyway, for the time being, Run Away!
