My computer is a 2.4 Ghz iMac and I'm running these drives on FW800.Regarding performance, these drives are great. As a comparison, I have a 750GB WD MyBook FW800 drive  that I had been using as my backup drive. I copied a 17GB file from the main computer to both drives (at different times) and it took over 6 TIMES as long to transfer the files to the old drive (which is less than 1/2 full) compared to these drives.Non-performance stuff: this drive is quiet. Also, both of my drives checked out to be unaffected by the drive issue according to the Seagate website.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great price-performance drive", "unixReviewTime": 1236816000, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2009"}
