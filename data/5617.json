I'm using this Seagate 1TB drive as a secondary HDD (primary drive is much smaller) and I use it to store my music, movies, etc. Thank goodness I also back up everything to a THIRD external drive, because as it turns out the only way to get my computer to start working again was to unplug this internal Seagate drive. I checked and ironically I ordered this drive a year ago to the day. So yeah...the drive was fine while it was working, but one year later and it seems to be busted. Not planning on buying another Seagate any time soon.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Works fine...until it breaks.", "unixReviewTime": 1270684800, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2010"}
