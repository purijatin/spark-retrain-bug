Installation was a breeze and my system was up and running in no time.  So far, the drive is working fine--  fast and quite, and much larger than my old drive.  If you do not need the SATA cables and controller, go for this one; it's only the bare drive and therefore, cheaper than buying the kit which includes the cables and controller.
