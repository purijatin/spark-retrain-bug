Just 8 months later all three drives are failing: each has a SMART problem (detected by Windows and by Seagate SeaTools) and two of the three also fail SeaTools short drive tests. I use these drives in an extremely well ventilated Antec P182 case that has a separate hard drive bay that keeps them isolated from the heat produced by the motherboard and graphics card, so heat is NOT the reason these drives are failing. I believe the real issue is with poor quality components. I use a fair number of other Seagate drives and have had no problems with them. I bought literally about a dozen 2.5\" 7200rpm drives for upgrading various notebooks (Mac and PC) without any issues--for a while I was replacing all my friend's drives after I sped my macbook 13 drive up from 4200RPM to 7200RPM and was showing everyone the performance improvements... In any case the problems I've had with these drives seem to be an issue limited to this particular version.The only positive thing I can say is that at least I learned these drives were going bad before they completely died. I was able to back up all my data to my NES array. I've filled out RMAs through the Seagate webpage and will hopefully get replacement drives soon, but I don't know that I'll actually trust them considering my 100% fail rate with the three I already own. I may decide to replace them with WD drives instead.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "3 Dead drives in less than 12 months!", "unixReviewTime": 1249862400, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2009"}
