Worked great for about 13 months and then with no warning (grinding noises, etc.) of imminent failure, I turned my computer off on a Thursday night and Friday morning the bios would not recognize my HDD.  I just got the \"No boot device available, Press ENTER key to retry\". I then purchased a copy of \"SpinRite 6.0\" hoping to just recover my data. \"SpinRite\" only recognized the \"A\" drive that the floppy was in. I even tried an external HDD enclosure with another computer, but that didn't work either.Three weeks earlier, I had sold (after cleaning and formating) a Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500 GB External Hard Drive\" because my Son had given me a new \"WD, My Passport Essential SE\" external hard drive.  As I am typing this review, I am looking at that \"factory sealed\" package and just shaking my head.I wish that I had know of the firmware update fromm 7200.11 to 7200.12.  That may have helped.Seagate is replacing my HDD under warranty, but years of information, pictures (less what has been saved to DVD's) and records are lost. That is my fault for not backing up on a regular basis and I can live with that, but if there was a known problem with these drives, then I feel that Seagate should have let all registerd users know of the firmware update, hence my one star rating.  There must be a reason that they have cut short their warranty period from five years to three...", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Mine Also Failed...", "unixReviewTime": 1304467200, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2011"}
