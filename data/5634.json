During that time, it has disappeared several times daily.  Now it doesn't show up in the BIOS.  I have four of these drives in RAID 5 using a 3ware 9650SE-8.  Luckily the 3ware card is very smart and I am still able to use my computer.  Even when it is \"working\" this RAID unit with these drives was slower than it should be.  So now I need to buy 4 more drives and rebuild my system.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Steer away from these Seagate 7200.11 series", "unixReviewTime": 1228953600, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2008"}
