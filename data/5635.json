In less than a week stated to get Hard Drive Failure is Imminent messages.  Ran the Seagate diagostic software and the drive did not pass.  Currently am waiting for a replacement drive from Seagate.  Luckily still had the original 80GB drive that I had cloned from and was able to reinstall it.  It is a shame that a brand new drive would not last more than a week.  An internet search shows that there has been a high failure rate for this model of HD.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Failed in less than a week", "unixReviewTime": 1292976000, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2010"}
