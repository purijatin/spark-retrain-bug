I received mine and was told by the seagate site I did not need it. So I installed, loaded OS, powered down a couple of times to test and everything works fine. Pretty fast write speeds as well. Btw I have purchased personally and for work Seagate, Maxtor, Western Digital and Hitachi/IBM drives and all have at one point or another have failed. Yes the seagate issue is a special case just like the IBM \"Deathstars\" years ago. But to say one company makes drives that fail more than others is just bullcaca.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1239840000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2009"}
