So that's likely a better option.ORIGINAL REVIEW:As of now, this is the state of the art Seagate 1TB drive.  It uses just three drive platters (the thing that looks like a compact disc in the photo - there's actually a stack of those inside your hard drive!).  Older 1TB drives used 4 or even 5 platters.Less platters means greater data density, which means faster data transfer speeds.  Less platters also means cooler operating temperatures, usually.The 7200.11 line of drives uses 333GB platters.  The new 7200.12 drives with 500GB platters is starting to be released - a one platter, 500GB drive is available now.  A two platter 1TB drive should be out sometime in the next month or two.By the way, a few notes about OEM / bulk drives:- OEM or bulk means it comes in plain packaging, with no software, screws or cables.  If you're replacing a drive, that may not be a problem.  But if it's a new installation, you'll need a SATA data cable and (often) a power adapter.- As of 1/3/2009, Seagate has reduced the warranty on their OEM hard drives from 5 years to 3 years.  Not a big deal to me, as after 3 years I'm not going to pay to return the drive and put the 3+-year-old model refurbished drive I get back in my machine anyway.  The real issue is, what's the reliability of the drive, so you don't need the warranty?  It's very hard to get a good answer on that.Many people would say buy a Seagate, Western Digital, or Hitachi drive, and after that, it's a roll of the dice.  Certainly making sure your fans are working and you clean out the dust bunnies helps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A good 1TB drive choice", "unixReviewTime": 1230940800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2009"}
