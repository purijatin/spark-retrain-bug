I bought my ST31000333AS over a year ago, use it in an external Vantec case with firewire connection. Blazing speed, never a problem. Note that if you buy the drive alone you don't get rails, disc, anything but the drive itself. If you want a kit with all the cables, etc, then go for that and pay more. I was using Western Digital HD's for years, finally gave up after the n-th one died. Been using the Seagate Barracuda line exclusively for several years now, 300GB, 400GB, 1TB. No complaints. They run so quiet you don't know they're there. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seagate ST31000333AS", "unixReviewTime": 1260316800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2009"}
