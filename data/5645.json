Thankfully I've been using them as one disk in a RAID, so I haven't lost any data yet, but this failure rate is unacceptable. Meanwhile, the Western Digital drives in my RAID have been chugging along for over 3 years without issue. Do *not* buy these Seagate drives unless you want to lose data.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Danger--stay away!", "unixReviewTime": 1319414400, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2011"}
