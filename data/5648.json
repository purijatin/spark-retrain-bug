It worked fine for me. I partitioned this without any issues. It has not given me any issues till date. I have it hooked to my WDTV and it works flawlessly.The speed on this is blocked to 1.5Gbps by a jumper. Remove the jumper to bring out it's full potential of 3.0Gbps.Would definitely recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good speed, reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1246924800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2009"}
