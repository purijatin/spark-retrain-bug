One hard drive to stayfar far away.  The 36 that \"died\" just bricked out.  Badfirmware, etc.  Its amazing how Seagate has yet to be suedfor issuing so many dead drives.  Well, they are paying theprice as their competitors are catching up with them.Guaranteed:  Seagate will not have the title of \"bestselling\" hard drive maker after 2011.Daniel J.
