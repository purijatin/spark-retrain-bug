It worked just fine. My family members were using it for both high-wattage and low-wattage appliances. It was very handy to have a single converter for all cases. What can I say - it worked as supposed and didn't break. The set of 5 different adapters (all types used on the planet) was very handy too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable and very convenient", "unixReviewTime": 997574400, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2001"}
