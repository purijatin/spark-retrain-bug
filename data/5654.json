MacWade", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I'm disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use.  It was plugged-into a standard 220-volt outlet in a UK hotel.  But it overheated witin 15 minutes and had to be shut down frequently.  Now I am using a Tacima step-down transformer.  Look into the Proctor-SIlex model as well.  This Recoton couldn't handle the job, and I was using the 50-watt setting.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Fuse did not work - unit blew up!", "unixReviewTime": 1117584000, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2005"}
