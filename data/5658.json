They worked flawlessly, with both high and low-voltage devices. We tried them with hair dryers, digital camera battery rechargers, etc. and no problems. They are quite large and heavy, though, and we ditched the carrying case, etc., and just threw the converter into our suitcases..One important thing to remember is that you only need a voltage CONVERTER if the devices you wish to power are incapable of operating at the voltage being provided in the country you're visting. I found that my cell phone charger AND my Nikon digital camera battery recharger were both designed for BOTH 110 and 220 Volt operation (read the fine print stamped on the charger) so all I needed was the \"plug adaptor\" (and NOT a voltage converter) for these two chargers... The plug adaptors are about $2-$3 each...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Big and heavy, but they work well...", "unixReviewTime": 1167868800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2007"}
