I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.  All in all I am very happy with my NOOK and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook Reader.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love, love love my NOOK.", "unixReviewTime": 1296000000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2011"}
