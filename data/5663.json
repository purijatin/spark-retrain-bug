I unplugged it, and one side of the casing had started to melt. The next day I mustered the courage to plug it in again, and while it did get hot (REALLY HOT) it didn't melt any further and I didn't smell any more smoke.On the low-power setting, you can't run more than one laptop or a couple small things without it overheating...don't even try to run anything less than a big hair dryer on the high-power setting.All that said...it did run my laptop, charge the camera batteries, charge the cell phones, etc. for the whole 2-week trip.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Low quality, but it did work for the whole trip.", "unixReviewTime": 1195516800, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2007"}
