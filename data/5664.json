We made sure the switch was on the low wattage setting and within minutes, it started smelling like burned plastic.  But it worked.  The second time she used it, not only did the converter burn out, but her $150 hair straightener burned out as well.  And we made sure it was on the 50 watt setting.  By the way, the same wall outlet worked for all of my universal devices (110-240 voltage) like my ipod, blackberry, and camera chargers with no problem - so the problem was clearly isolated to this converter.It seems to be a manufacturing issue that some people who buy this get good converters while others get faulty ones.  But is it worth spending money on this only to have it either not work or even burn out your device?The only redeeming thing about this is that you get the attachments along with the converter.  The outlets in Europe are inset in the wall.  So even though the converter plugs are the proper shape, it is NOT long enough to reach the inset outlet.  But it is with the attachments.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very unreliable product, save your money and buy something else", "unixReviewTime": 1220832000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2008"}
