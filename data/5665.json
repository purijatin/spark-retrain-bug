While theoretically the converter reduces voltage from 230V to 120V, my daughter's hair straightener overheated and melted the adhesive holding the heating elements so the straightener was ruined.  My only thought was that 50Hz frequency of the power overseas could cause greater current draw for heating devices such as hair dryers, coffee pots, straighteners.  The voltage converter cannot modify frequency from 50 Hz to 60 Hz.  Most battery charging devices for laptops, cellphones, camera battery packs operate on 120/240 50/60 Hz and will not need the converter but you will need the plug adapter for the wall outlet.  Look at the rating label on each device to confirm.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Voltage Converter", "unixReviewTime": 1187827200, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2007"}
