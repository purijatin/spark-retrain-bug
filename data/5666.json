Perhaps the only problem with the Recoton is the plug. As the converter is so heavy it does not always stay attached to well to the wall/outlet. I use mine in multi-plug strip that sits on the floor, so I don't have to worry about the converter falling out. If you plan on staying in one place for an extended period of time (i.e. not using the converter while traveling), I would suggest the Franzus 85 Watt available on Amazon. It's heavier and bulkier than the Recoton, but it's grounded and accepts US grounded plugs AND uses the Shhuka-style (grounded and recessed, holding the converter nicely in the wall) plug found in much of Europe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 years continuous use and still works great", "unixReviewTime": 1163548800, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2006"}
