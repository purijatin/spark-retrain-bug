If the device (or its charger) is 120/240V, you only need a plug adapter to fit the electrical outlet.The voltage converter worked perfectly and allowed me to recharged the DVD battery, via its AC adapter power cord, half a dozen times. I had the wattage switch on \"low\" (0-50W) for this use. I would award four and a half stars if I could, because I never used it with a high wattage appliance, and hence cannot attest that it works as well under such conditions.I sometimes travel with a portable hair dryer, but it has a dual voltage switch, so I only use it with a plug adapter. Additionally, the dryer is in the neighborhood of 1600 watts, so I would be reticent to try an appliance at the top of the converter's stated wattage range.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Has worked perfectly so far on two European trips", "unixReviewTime": 1140739200, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2006"}
