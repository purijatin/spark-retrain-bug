Whitehead", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I've researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note, I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all,touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer (as does the Sony). You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle).The nook's battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card, which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages,but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Home Run!", "unixReviewTime": 1282867200, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2010"}
