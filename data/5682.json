It works, but the documentation is scanty. There are 2 LEDs over each port, the function of these two is not differentiated in the manual. Printed on the front of the unit is a small note that if an LED is on continuously, the port is linked, and blinking indicates activity. So I hook it up, and the left LED on port 1 and the right LED on port 2 light continuously. I download files -- no blinking. I read the install manual, which says if the lights do not blink, that indicates a connection problem. Patch cords from router are the same that worked fine with my Linksys (and the lights blinked to show activity). Called support; took 10 minutes with an agent who had no tech knowledge and only wanted to \"register\" me.. Finally was transferred to 2nd level support. Agent could not understand my concern, did not know why there were 2 LEDs per port, and told me don't worry, everything OK, ignore the manual and printing on unit..I will return this unit, and buy a Linksys switch.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor documentation, questionable quality / support", "unixReviewTime": 1339200000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2012"}
