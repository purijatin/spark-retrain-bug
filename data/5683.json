I used this switch as the central distribution point for CAT6 cable runs in lieu of a more elaborate backboard installation. The switch is wall-mounted in a utility closet and easily accessible if we need to make changes. The switch is as described and was delivered on time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple, rugged and reliable switch", "unixReviewTime": 1404604800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2014"}
