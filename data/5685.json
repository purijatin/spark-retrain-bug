Kling \"JKling\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I have a Linksys 4 wired port/2 wireless connection router and needed to add additional wired computers to my home network. This switch was very inexpensive compared to other choices. Installation was easy - I just plugged one connection into my router and connected the remaining computers and it was good to go. I have both internal and Internet access and there's no noticeable difference in speed. Some reviews have said it runs hot, but I haven't noticed that at all. There's no warm electric smell and the box is cool to the touch. I highly recommend this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for home networking", "unixReviewTime": 1229040000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2008"}
