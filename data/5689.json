Clemens \"Astronomy Buff\"", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewtext": "This 10/100 megabit switch is great if you are starting to feel the squeeze of a 10 megabit network. If you're like me, it getting pretty old moving huge scanned pictures and other large files around the home LAN. At 10 megabits, it typically took me 20-30 minutes to get a CDR worth of scanned images over to my CDR writing machine for backup. Well, not any more!Since I hooked up my FS-108, I can move a CDR worth of images or MP3 files (650 megs worth) in about 3-4 minutes instead of that 20-30.This switch is a piece of art. Built like a tank, incredibly solid and small for what it does. No fan, so it makes no noise whatsoever. The switch hooked up painlessly and worked flawlessly from the get-go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Netgear's FS-108: a 1st class switch at a fantastic value", "unixReviewTime": 975628800, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2000"}
