I have an iMac, Apple TV, and BluRay player all hooked up ti this switch.  There is no buffering when watching any streaming service on any device.  Highly recommend this for those with weak or spotty Wi-Fi signals.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy - No Set Up Needed", "unixReviewTime": 1391212800, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2014"}
