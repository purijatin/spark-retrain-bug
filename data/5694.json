It works perfectly and since each port is auto-sensing, you don't have to fiddle with which port is the uplink port. Reasonable priced as well. You can spend half as much for Chinese knockoffs, but I don't want to take chances like that -- all these packets need to get to the right place error free.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good product", "unixReviewTime": 1401926400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2014"}
