After going back and forth with various ISPs and checking everything else, I realized the problem was in these switches.  Unplugging the FS108, waiting a second and plugging it in, the problem instantly disappears.  After some periods of time, and possibly under occasional heavy use, these switches begin to not function properly and need to be reset.  Once they're reset, they work fine.  This is an otherwise solid unit except it cannot be left unattended and operate reliably in my experience.  Unfortunately, that's what these switches should do.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Promising, but unreliable", "unixReviewTime": 1253750400, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2009"}
