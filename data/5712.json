So it is the bottleneck in my network. I now use it as an extra switch if I need additional temporary connections. It states \"Every port supports up to 200 Mbps in dedicated bandwidth\" but I could verify this.Pros:- Very reliable- Small footprintCons:- Only for 10/100 Mbps networks- No indicator light on front (non cable side since this is not rack mounted)- Rubber feet tend to fall off", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Read the fine print (maybe not so fine)", "unixReviewTime": 1303257600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2011"}
