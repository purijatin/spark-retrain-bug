Worked like a charm.  It has more slots than I needed but may hook the Wii console to the internet some day.....if I figure out why!  Good product and with the $10 rebate it was a very cheap solution to my problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked Great For Home Theater", "unixReviewTime": 1309996800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2011"}
