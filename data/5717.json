Yes, there are a couple of these even cheaper, but sometimes you do get what you pay for. This is a hefty little box for the size and it feels quite solid and well made. While I agree with a couple comments regarding the location of the power plug, it was not a deal killer for me at all. It sits back behind everything and is in no way an eyesore among my TV and game gear. I have it connected to an XBox, my DVR, a Sony BluRay player and have one port still available if I ever decide to connect my TV. I ran an ethernet cable from the modem/router in my media room into the family room via the attic, and once connected, all components worked immediately with no issues at all. We ended up using the extra port for a few days while we were having problems with our wireless network before the replacement router arrived, and the connections on the notebooks were excellent as well. (Wireless module had gone out, ethernet was still working fine obviously!)This is an WONDERFUL deal for the price, especially with the rebate.EDIT: Been meaning to mention this for awhile.. I liked this particular switch so much that when we needed it, I bought another one of these for a different room, it works just as well. Both are still working flawlessly and I HIGHLY recommend this item if you are in need of an ethernet switch box!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "EXACTLY what was needed.", "unixReviewTime": 1298678400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2011"}
