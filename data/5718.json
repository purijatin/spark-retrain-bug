So far it has been working 24/7 for the past 6 months with no problems.This switch is super simple.  There are no web interfaces and complicated configuration steps to go through.  Don't need them.  Just plug it in, plug in your CAT5 cables and go.  The hardest part of the installation was installing the screws for wall mounting it.The only thing I can complain about is the huge power supply that powers it; I'm pretty sure it outweighs the switch and it is large enough that if you plug it into the top socket of an outlet it will block the bottom one.  Thankfully, Netgear chose to go with prongs that allow it to be inserted upside down in a socket.  Additionally, they provided about 5 feet of wire to give plenty of flexibility in locating the switch and I was able to place it in an inconspicuous spot.If you need expand your home network, this little unit will do it in a snap.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple and Reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"}
