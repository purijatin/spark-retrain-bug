The packaging is easy to open and everything needed is included except for an ethernet cable, but you should have 1 or 2 of these laying around already.Installation is super easy, just plug in the power connector and plug in your in and out ethernet connections and you're done.Construction is very solid and I can see this box lasting almost forever unless you drop it from a 20 story building.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for Home Network", "unixReviewTime": 1318377600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2011"}
