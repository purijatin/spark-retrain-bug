I unboxed it, mounted it on a wall, plugged it in and it was good to go. Better built and half the size of the D Link switch it replaced. I really like the fact that it has a metal housing and not cheap plastic. If you need a well built an inexpensive switch I highly recommend this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works like it should.", "unixReviewTime": 1298592000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2011"}
