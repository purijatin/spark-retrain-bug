Switches are simple pieces of equipment that should be placed as basically a way to get extra ports on your router. Take a cable from one of your numbered ports on the router to the switch, and you now have 4 new ports on your router! Make sure when you do your math though you count the two spots (one on the switch, one on the router) that you won't have. Example: If you are using a linksys router, they have 4 numbered slots usually. and this has 5. That does not mean you can get 9 devices hardwired. You will get 7, instead of four...3 computers on the router, one cable on the router goes to the switch, and then four extras on the switch! Good luck!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent way to get extra router ports!", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2013"}
