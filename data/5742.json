The modem/router is in the living room, and my bedroom was completely wireless (Xbox 360 and PC). Due to issues with the Xbox 360 wireless settings, I decided to hard-wire the Xbox 360. After having issues with the services to my PC via wireless, I decided that I too wanted to hard-wire the PC. My only concern was that I did not want to run 2 Cat5e cables from the router to the bedroom. I decided to run 1 cat5e cable to a switch in the bedroom, and then a cat5e cable to each the Xbox 360 and the PC. Thus far, it is working like a charm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1363651200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2013"}
