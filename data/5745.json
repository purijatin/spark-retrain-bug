I needed an efficient and reliable switch inside my network control panel, a panel in a closet where all my telephone, cable TV, alarm system, and Ethernet wires interconnect.  Since the panel was rather crowded already, I needed a compact unit with a hardy case.  This unit fits the bill and it is working as designed.  This is an industrial looking switch well suited for inside a panel.  It would not look so great on a desktop.  For that I would recommend the Linksys SE1500, a similar unit, seemingly reliable, with a sharper look.  I did not have \"the loose plug\" issue another reviewer experienced.  Mine fits well - luck of the draw I guess.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sturdy switch", "unixReviewTime": 1335657600, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2012"}
