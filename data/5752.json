You use an Ethernet Switch sort of like an outlet strip for power. You plug one Ethernet run from your Cable or DSL Ethernet modem source into the Ethernet Switch and then can plug up to 4 other ethernet runs or devices into the remaining ports on the Ethernet Switch. it doesn't require and setup - you just plug and go. It lets more devices share your Internet connection.This is a small box and feels solidly made due to its metal case. It uses a small external power supply (provided) to power the Ethernet Switch. I has been my experience in the past with Netgear products that these tend to be very reliable and long lasting.The only small negative is that it would be nicer still if they put the power supply into the device itself. I am not a fan of the \"Wall Wart\" power supply.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Little 5 Port Ethernet Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1379030400, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2013"}
