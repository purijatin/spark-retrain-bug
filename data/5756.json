This was extremely easy to set up, even for a 57 year old who abhors modern day technology--he did it on his own.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality, cheaply priced ethernet switch.  If you are looking for an ethernet cable, look at MediaBridge's products, as they are of great quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great to split internet connection into two seperate devices", "unixReviewTime": 1405036800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014"}
