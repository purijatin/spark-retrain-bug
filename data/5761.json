I got this product cause my wireless router ports were all used up and needed more for my pc, and blu-ray player, and xbox 360, and works fine. Only problem I have is the power cord doesn't fit in the Switch port it keeps slipping out. But I just tied it with some string and its good enough for me as long as it works. xD  I'm sure if I returned it and got another one it would work alot better. I Prob just got a faulty one :(", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Netgear Switch Port", "unixReviewTime": 1286236800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2010"}
