Henderson", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "This is a nice, compact 5-port plug-and-play switch that definitely improved the speed of my local PC network.  I read a review where this switch runs hot.  I have all five ports in use and its running around 99F degrees.  My DSL modem with just two ports in use actually runs hotter (101F).  Okay, four degrees but you can tell a difference when you touch them.  The FS105 switch does not interfere with AM radio reception as my old Linksys 5 port hub especially at the upper AM radio band.  Perhaps it is the metal box of the FS105 that provides better shielding.  Its nice that Netgear gives me the screws and wall anchors for mounting the switch to something either wood or plaster.  But is it too much to ask Netgear to include a mounting template (piece of paper) so I can put those screws exactly where I need them with less fuss than measuring and guessing?Perhaps I should not be disappointed that the FS105 I got is not the same one as pictured on the Amazon page.  That picture shows an uplink button and the unit is wider.  I connected a cable from my DSL modem/router's uplink port to the first port of this switch and it works just fine.If you only need four to five ports, this is a very nice non-managed switch.  And did you know that according to Netgear, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is twice that of either the FS108 (8-port version) or the FS116 (16-port version).  It may make more sense to buy two of these switches from a reliability sense.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Definitely improves performance for a small LAN", "unixReviewTime": 1175126400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2007"}
