They're small, simple, well-constructed, and they work, no fuss. This one and ones like it with more ports have been on the market for years, seemingly unchanged -- probably because they work as advertised for a good price.This one is no different. I'm happy to see that they have replaced the old wall-wart linear power supplies with a more modern switching supply. This will waste less power, which is nice on something that will be plugged in basically all the time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple, robust, no problems", "unixReviewTime": 1365033600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2013"}
