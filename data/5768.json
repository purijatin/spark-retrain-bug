I have plugged in three computers into this 5 port switch and all of them work fine. With the Ethernet cards installed in all my systems, I found the installation to be a cakewalk. The configuration is so simple and it just takes a few moments of your time. I just had to plug in the power cable first then connected the Ethernet cables of all the comps and it was ready. But it needs an external power supply chord and does not have a power on switch. The metal casing makes this device quite heavy. Not that I carry it around all the time but it could have been of lesser weight.The LED lights and the Ethernet ports are on the same side. This is a major disadvantage for me because the wires flow on my desk. Had the ports been at the back I would have had some control in keeping my desk uncluttered.My FS105NA also gets warm after continuous usage for more than an hour.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "LED lights and Ethernet ports on same side causing problems", "unixReviewTime": 1276128000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2010"}
