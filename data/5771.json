One port is taken up with your internet link, so you can attach four additional items to this.  This switch comes with a power supply so you need a plug near by to use it.  It worked right out of the box without needing to install any software.  I have a Windows 7 laptop and a Sony BluRay player attached to it. I feel I have definitely gotten my money's worth.  Netgear makes a good quality product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small Switch Big Performance", "unixReviewTime": 1300320000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2011"}
