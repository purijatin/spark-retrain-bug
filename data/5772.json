I have a cable that runs from a router in my house to my office which is located in a separate building behind the house. The switch is in my office and performs flawlessly. I have a desktop connected to the switch and am able to transfer large files with ease. I have a phone system connected to it that works better than my landline. I have a wireless access point connected to it for the use of my netbook which is located on the opposite side of my office. This has been a unexpectedly useful investment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}
