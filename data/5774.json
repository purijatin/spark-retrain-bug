I use a lot of them in my small business.  They're very handy to park on conference tables and desks to provide wired internet connections for multiple people.  It's a very solidly built model (all metal), with a no-frills industrial design and small footprint.  Installation is a snap -- just plug in the power supply, connect your PCs/peripherals with regular patch cables, and your done.Two issues:1) This is not a gigabit switch, just an old-fashioned 10/100 switch.  If you're just using it for internet connections, that's probably fine, since you'll be limited by your internet speed anyway.  But if you're running a gigabit ethernet and want to move gigs over the network quickly, you'll need a faster switch (assuming all the other gear on your network is also gigabit speed).2) I have had a couple of this switches fail over the years, and it's always been the power supply that failed, not the switch.  Given how cheap these are now, I'd suggest that you buy a spare, just to have the spare power supply on hand, if you can't afford to have a network failure for more than a few minutes.  If the power supply fails, you can plug in a new power supply in under a minute, which is easier than replacing a whole switch.  I don't want to make it seem like the Netgear power supply is unreliable -- I've had two power supplies fail over the past four years.  I just wanted to provide a bit of useful \"just in case\" advice for small businesses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super solid switch at a low cost -- 10/100, not gigabit ethernet", "unixReviewTime": 1294444800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2011"}
