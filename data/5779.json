The Dynex was plastic and felt cheap. I love that this NetGear switch has a metal body. It feels like better construction overall, and at $12 less, it's a great deal. All the ports work exactly as expected.My only complaint is that the power plug and the RJ45 jacks are on opposite sides of the switch. This may not matter to you, but for me it was slightly annoying because the switch sits in an entertainment center just like a DVD player or a set top box. It would be nice if all the cables came out of the same side so everything could be together, but it certainly isn't a deal breaker.I would definitely buy this again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1293494400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2010"}
