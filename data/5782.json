You don't have to match up a jack number on one side with a light number on the other side.  I've had several at work and at home and not one has ever failed on me.  It's wall-mountable.  And they now come with a small, lightweight, energy-efficient AC adapter instead of the huge, heavy one that Netgears had been known for. The $10 rebate process went smoothly, though I received it on a Visa card rather than a check.  I tucked this switch in my brother-in-law's TV furniture to network his TV, Blu-ray player, and Wii.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Status lights on each jack, reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1266192000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2010"}
