It probably works the same as the rest, but has a nice substantial feel to it.  Plus I though of going all gigabit, but in a home setting do you really need it?  If you have download speeds of 25 mbps thats for the whole house, and is super fast, if you have 50 thats phenomenal, but probably more than you need to have 10 roku's streaming at once, so save a little cash and this should meet you needs just fine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love the feel", "unixReviewTime": 1367884800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2013"}
