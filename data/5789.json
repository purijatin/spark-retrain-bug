The location is Out Door in a harsh seaside environment.  The switch is mounted inside a waterproof box along with its power supply and another POE power supply for another device.  My concern was mostly that the switch might overheat in direct sunlight.  After two weeks it is performing very well and has experienced several days in mid-90s.  It also works flawlessly over the WiFi Bridge connection.  I'm very happy with this switch.  If it does ultimately have issues with heat I would not blame in on this device as I am pushing it hard with this particular application.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tough Job Well Done", "unixReviewTime": 1377907200, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2013"}
