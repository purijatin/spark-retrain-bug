Kitashiro \"gkitash\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I purchased two of these switches to extend my home network; I needed two switches to accommodate upstairs/downstairs locations in home.  They provide additional ports on a Netgear FVS114 ProSafe VPN firewall with built-in 4 port switch.  I also have two wireless networks connected to the wired network; one supports video from a surveillence camera.Installation was a breeze with nothing to configure; I wall-mounted one switch and 'installed' the second on the floor next to the outlet jack at my upstairs location.These switches provide many network configuration options and I've used Netgear products for years with no problems.  I expect the same will be true with these switches.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great home network extender", "unixReviewTime": 1194393600, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2007"}
