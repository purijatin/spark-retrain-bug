I bought this switch to expand my U-verse router port count.I now have an Ooma Telo (home phone), an AT&T; Microcell 3G, and a Obi110 (office phone) plugged into this Netgear switch, and then 1 single cable goes from the Netgear switch to the U-verse 2Wire router.  No configuring, setup, management, etc. needed.I plug the following directly into my U-verse router:  my desktop computer, my HP laptop computer with docking station, an ActionTec powerline networking module which sends LAN over the outlets of my house to my LG 3D TV.  So far everything is very stable, and I'm pleased because I now have available ports and can do everything I'm trying to do from a networking perspective.In short, I highly recommend this switch.  It is literally so easy a caveman could do it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1336003200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2012"}
