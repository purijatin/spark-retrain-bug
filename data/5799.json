I have my office with modem and router upstairs, and powerline networking for downstairs. Lots of people dump on powerline, but I have NO problem with it. I used this connection for my PS3, because I personally hate wi-fi, especially for gaming. I recently upgraded my TV and theater system to internet connectible equipment. My options were to buy a new powerline adapter for the multiple new connections, use an old router I had laying around as a switch, or buy something like this. I am glad I went this route.The unit is very solid, and heavier than you would expect just looking at it, but that doesn't matter, because you wont be holding it. It really is as trouble free to install as everyone says. I have ZERO loss of speed in PS3. I can even can still stream Vudu in HDX with full strength. This unit is attached to a Belkin Conserve power strip, and comes on like a charm everytime power is restored. If it helps those with a similar setup, here's what I got:Sony Bravia 46\" TV ethernet connected, Sony Blu-Ray home theater system ethernet connected, and PS3 ethernet connected to this switch. Everything is connected to Belkin Conserve Smart F7C007q AV Energy Saving Power Strip (TV master)with Netgear powerline adapter providing the internet connection from my upstairs Netgear router.And finally: Yes, it is only 10/100, but find me one thing in your home, starting with your modem and signal from your ISP that needs more. If you aren't a business or have a super home network based on 1000, you really don't need it. This will be fine for 99% of everyone, and perfect for home theater uses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exactly what I needed for home theater connection", "unixReviewTime": 1304812800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2011"}
