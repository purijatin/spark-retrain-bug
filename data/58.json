The ability to move her 26\" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to \"fall\" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.Otherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about. I would not set a tv larger than a 30\" or so on this. I just don't trust it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works, but I don't trust it", "unixReviewTime": 1328572800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2012"}
