Anderson", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I agree with the other reviewers, in that this is a very solid built and reliable product.  I've been using mine for six months now and have not had to touch it.  It performs very well, as I've ran multiple file transfers simultaneously among four computers and it was amazingly faster than when using an older 10/100 hub.The one complaint that I have about Netgear switches and routers is that many of them have the ports on the front of the unit instead of the back.  If you're installing this in some out-of-the-way place like your attic or basement, or if you're installing in a computer rack where you want everything facing front, this is a non-issue.  If you want to put this on your desktop it is a major inconvenience, because the cables coming into the switch will either be strung across the front of your desk, or will snake over and behind the unit.  In either case, you have cables on your desktop and it's quite unsightly.All things considered I'm still happy with the Netgear switch, but if I had it to do over again I would have probably bought one that worked better in my home office.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I wish the ports were on the back", "unixReviewTime": 1043193600, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2003"}
