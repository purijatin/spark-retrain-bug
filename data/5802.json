You can't get any better than this. For folks out there that are new to networking, you actually want one of these switches, compared to a hub, because switches will streamline your network and make it run more smoothly. When you use a hub, the IP packets will collide and the QOS services of your network card will be doing overtime to get your data to the next target. Switches analyse these packets and deliver them out the proper port to the actual destination. I can highly recommend these to anyone building their professional or home network!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A tried at true solution...", "unixReviewTime": 1359417600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2013"}
