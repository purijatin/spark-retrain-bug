Conway \"jackmusic\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I was concerned about my hook-up situation as I have one switch box in a bedroom running to my computer and needed to see if I could hook up another behind my tv in the living room.  Wasn't quite sure if running from one switch box to another would even work or if I would get the speed I needed for HD streaming from Amazon and Netflix.  All I can say it that it works great!!  No problems, no issues.  One cable from the bedroom to the box behind the tv, and two cables from the box, one to the blu-ray player and one to the Roku box, with HDMI cables to the tv.  Again, works great!!  And the price on this box was a lot cheaper than my local stores.  Thanks Amazon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great!!", "unixReviewTime": 1362873600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2013"}
