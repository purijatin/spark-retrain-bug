I already had a cable run to the other room for my laptop (wired is faster than its wireless card), which runs Linux (Ubuntu).  \"Installation\" is probably too complex a word--literally, I just plugged in the power cord, plugged in my cable from my router, and then plugged in my computer and printer--and it just worked.  I have a faster-than-average internet connection (DOCSIS), and tested the speed both with without the switch, and it was the same (47-49mb/s download, 4-5mb/s up).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple and Efficient", "unixReviewTime": 1302652800, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2011"}
