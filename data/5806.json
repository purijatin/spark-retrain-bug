Simply be aware that one of the five ports will be utilized to tie into another switch, the router or the network in general, so only four ports remain useable to expand your network.  This is a very handy device where you have a single network connection run to say a bed room or to an entertainment center but then need to add multiple devices to the network, say a network printer, a Roku Box such asRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, etc. Would buy again, though if you need more ports, check outNetgear FS108 ProSafe 8-Port Fast Ethernet Desktop Switch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another quality product from Netgear - only 4 ports usable once connected to the router or network", "unixReviewTime": 1357862400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2013"}
