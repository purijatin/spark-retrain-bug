Being hardlined to my internet router, it is really fast and I really love it. The instruction manualdid not indicate which port to plug in the internet cable into but after calling the company the best one was port 5 althoughyou could plug into any port and also with the cables coming off but I feel 5 is the best.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1335484800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2012"}
