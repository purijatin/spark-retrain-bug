I love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in COLOR!VERY easy to set up account with B&N; using my nook. It serches for wi-fi and is very easy.Anytime I have had any problem, a simple re-boot fixes it.I love the \"free Friday\" that is offered. I have read SOOO many books since I bought it.I also think I would like the \"Lend Me\" option if any of my friends HAD a nook.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great!", "unixReviewTime": 1296518400, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2011"}
