On one of the ports, both lights lit continuously even with no plug in the port, and nothing connected to it on any port could communicate through it. There is nothing to configure, fix, or tweak. It doesn't even have an on/off switch-- it either works, or it doesn't.Like most Netgear products, the unit is built (on the outside) like a tank and has the appearance of durability but, of course, what counts is on the inside. After replacing it with another model, I was back in business.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Unreliable", "unixReviewTime": 1241308800, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2009"}
