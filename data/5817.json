{"reviewerID": "ACDUPC4QGE99F", "asin": "B00002EQCW", "reviewerName": "Joseph Chiu", "helpful": [133, 140], "reviewtext": "With switch prices coming down to about $10-per-port, it's hard to justify buying anything less than a 10/100-switch for all but the most cost-conscious buyer.As most 5-port 10/100 switches have the same capabilities and cost about the same, there's not much to distinguish one from another.  Still, I particularly like the Netgear FS-105 5-port switch.  Like other products from Netgear, this switch is a little nicer than the competition because it has:- Nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic.  The case also has a grounding tab in case you're using the switch in a (electrically) high-noise environment.- Connection status indicators built into the jacks, so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active. (The &quot;vistajack&quot; feature.)- Right-angled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally.- An easy-to-access switch to toggle port 1 between station mode and uplink mode.  Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together, this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.- Screw-mount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall, underside of a counter, etc.With a 1000-MAC address buffer and 200 Kbytes-per-port packet buffer, this switch can easily handle the typical traffic load of small- and medium-sized networks.The Netgear product is not the cheapest 10/100-switch (check out the D-Link Fast Ethernet Switch, for example), but for overall design and value-for-money, I still like the Netgear the most.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good, solid switch.
