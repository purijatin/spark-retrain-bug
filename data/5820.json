I like the fact that the Netgear switches are made of metal and not cheap plastic like almost everything else these days.Now regarding the rebates....it's comical.  You need to pre-submit your rebate through a company called prosaferebates and they are clueless on the current rebates going on with the Netgear Prosafe Switches, which means you can't pre-submit your rebate, and even if you could, you couldn't check the status.  If you enter the promo code for the current rebates (12-83226) you get \"0\" matches on the prosafe website.  I even e-mailed them and sent them the current rebate form .pdf from Amazon and they claim the last rebate expired in January even though this new rebate offer runs from 4/1/12 - 6/30/12.If anyone knows an address where I can just send in the rebate without this pre-submit nonsense, please let me know.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great switch....don't count on the rebate", "unixReviewTime": 1333756800, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2012"}
