Just plug in your devices and thats it! You don't have to even think about it... it does everything all on its own. This switch is built like a bomb-proof shelter, very tough. It dosen't have a fan but runs pretty cool, even when stacked on top of other networking gear in a un-cooled enviroment. The only problem I have with is is that there were 2 unused ports and the little wire things the touch the cable like kinda sunk down so they couldn't reach the cable so I had to use some tape to get to touch the connectors (thats why I gave it only 4 stars). Other than that it continues to run my network with no problems at all. I am more than 100% pleased with netgears fs105. I will be receiving a GS108 switch because i need a bigger, gigabit one and I will also be receving a N600 router. Will be puting reviews about those products up soon.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy, affordable, awesome!", "unixReviewTime": 1341705600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2012"}
