Back when Xbox 360's came without a wireless card (FOR SHAME, MICROSOFT!), I needed a switch to run my tiny home network of a PC, laptop, PS3, and Xbox 360.The switch works as advertised, great for home networks where you receive a residential internet connection &lt;= 100 mb/s.  However, if you're going to hook up a couple computers at school or work, you can get more out of a 10/100/1000 switch instead for a slightly higher investment.  The major downside to trying to network with a switch directly from your ISP is that sometimes it can be complicated to assign IP addresses and DNS manually on an Xbox 360 or PS3.  A router will automatically assign IP addresses, but a switch is an \"unintelligent\" device - it just passes the signal through.Make sure that you're getting the right product for your network.  If this is it, it won't fail you.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Cheap Switch, No Surprises", "unixReviewTime": 1278979200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2010"}
