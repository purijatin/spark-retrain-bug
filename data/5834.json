In my case it worked with every PC and net device in my house EXCEPT my desktop PC, which it would not link with.Netgear's tech support is less useful than breasts on a boar (How's the weather in India today?).  I could not get the phone support dude past \"The problem must be with your PC\", but my PC works with everything EXCEPT YOUR SWITCH!Problems like this suggest loose component tolerances that result in timing errors preventing a link between devices.Other Thoughts:Replaced withCisco SF 100D-05 5 Port Desktop 10/100 Switch, which was $2 cheaper, has a metal box the same size, and best of all is a Cisco product!I have used Netgear products in the past, and will in the future, but this one was a dud, and if anything goes wrong just RMA and skip the phone support.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cisco 1, Netgear 0", "unixReviewTime": 1331856000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2012"}
