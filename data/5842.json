However, one of the ports is used to connect to the modem.  As a result, you are left with only four usable ports.  I had another product previously that I replaced after three years.  It was a five port switch but it had another port to connect the modem so it had five usable ports.  This is what I thought I was buying based on the description.  The device works fine and is a good product.  If you need all five ports, you should get another product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Only 4 usable ports", "unixReviewTime": 1277683200, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2010"}
