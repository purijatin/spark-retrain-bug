I have only the cheapest DSL connection. I thought I would just try this and see what happens. I plugged my DSL modem into the Netgear switch and then plugged my new DVD player into the switch and turned everything on. I chose the Netflix option on the player and it connected, got my code, entered into the Netflix website, and I was instantly streaming my movie. My internet speed has not suffered at all. I would not be using the internet and watching a movie at the same time, but I tried using the internet while the movie was on just to see. No loss of speed. This little switch was the solution I needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Didn't need router to stream Netflix", "unixReviewTime": 1303257600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2011"}
