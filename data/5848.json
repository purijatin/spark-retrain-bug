When I simply used a WiFi router to distribute the signal among various computer, I ran into a recognition problem with Outlook and my employers network.  I discovered that for Outlook to work, the network name needed to be specific.  Adding a router, created a unique set of IP and network credential and while connectivity remained, I was stuck.I tried a &#34;splitter&#34; in the most traditional sense (it was literally was a splitter just like the type used in electric). But whether it was broken or simply failed to work, I'm unsure.The solution is this &#34;desktop&#34; Ethernet Switch (in this case a 5 port) which (like it's larger sibs) simply replicates the port and augments IP distribution.  This little unit has mounting screws (if you wanted to surface mount) or it can simply sit on the desk. It's powered by an adapter (to AC) and doesn't get hot.  It's multifunctional in terms of bandwidth and will scale for you.The perfect solution for me as I cabled from the Ethernet jack to the switch, then from the switch to my PC & WiFi router with additional access ports to spare. This model is available with 5 or 8 ports", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mini Switch splitter for your network", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2013"}
