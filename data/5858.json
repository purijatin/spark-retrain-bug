Even the box was easier to open than most (open top instead of slide-out like all the crap I usually end up with).This switch is nice and heavy - has a very solid, rugged feel. Don't know if it will hold up for years, but it looks like it could be around longer than me. No cheap plastic here.Took it out of the box, plugged it in, and hooked it up & I was golden &lt;1min total setup time, and no problems.Likes:-Price (I got it for $9 after rebate)-Durability-Size (very small - they did a good job being space-efficient).Dislikes:Didn't come with a pony", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazingly Simple, Easy, and Rugged", "unixReviewTime": 1294876800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2011"}
