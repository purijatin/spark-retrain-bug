The small footprint and the ease of installation is really something to behold.  It has been reliable as well, as a small, unmanaged switch should be.I debated on whether to get a gigabit switch or a fast ethernet (100Mbps) switch.  I decided to be cheap and went for this little switch.  I also have an old 10Mbit ethernet switch by Netgear; that only had four sockets, and one had to be designated for uplink.  That little switch was the part of a reason for taking the Netgear, though; it was small, and it was reliable.  In that regard, the switch did not disappoint.What did disappoint me was, though, the fact that file transfers between two peer computers (i.e. not to the Internet) took longer than expected.  The peak transfer rate could not go beyond 10MB/s; that is expected, and totally fine for my DSL (and for streaming from one computer to another, to an extent) but I found it to be sluggish, as the transfer rate I had from an external USB to hard drive could go for 30MB/s or higher.I gave full marks due to the fact that it was a great switch for its class.  The problem is, though, that the class itself is showing signs of age.  For those of you who would like to set up a home server, I recommend you make a jump to the realm of gigabit ethernet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good, but aging", "unixReviewTime": 1260748800, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2009"}
