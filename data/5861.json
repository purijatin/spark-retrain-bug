This is a nice compact switch that easily mounted on the back of the cabinet and allowed the single internet cat5 cable running in the wall to my router, to be shared on multiple devices.  Plugged in power, line to network and then to devices all was needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great switch", "unixReviewTime": 1240444800, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2009"}
