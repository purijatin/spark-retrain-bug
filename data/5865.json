Remington", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "We purchased this for an office upgrade that installed an Ethernet drop in the wall.  After the drop was installed, we exit the drop directly into the Netgear FS105 switch.  The FS105 gives us other ports, which we use for other devices.  It&#8217;s fast and reliable.The Netgear FS105 is a mainstay in the corporate world.  I work for a defense contractor and we have a number of these floating around the software integration and engineering R&D; departments.  They&#8217;re inexpensive, easy to set up, and simple to use.  Their footprint is very small and they can be easily mounted to a wall or situated on a desk or table without taking up much space.  The switch comes with a DC adapter that plugs in the wall.  I have mine mounted on the wall above the Ethernet drop.Each port contains LED indicators that provide visual status for what is connected.  The case is all metal and very sturdy.  The switch contains no fans, so it is virtually silent.  Overall, this is a great switch for the price.  Highly recommended!Be sure to review the technical specifications for this switch to ensure it is adequate for your installation.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple, inexpensive, reliable, and a workhorse!", "unixReviewTime": 1359590400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2013"}
