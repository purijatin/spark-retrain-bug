Moltzon", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewtext": "I already own a Wi-Fi + 3G Kindle and had compared reviews between the Nook and Kindle extensively, before buying the Kindle.  But because the Nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free, and my wife was hogging the Kindle, I decided to try a Nook, at a reduced price.  While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.  I'm getting about 3-5 days of battery life in \"airplane mode\" (wi-fi and 3G turned off), and that's enough to finish a book without recharging.  I'm not rating reliability, because I've only had it for about a month.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Refurb Nook Worth the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1304121600, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2011"}
