While our wireless can reach there, we wanted the solid performance and security of a hardwired connection to both the TV and the Blu-Ray player.  Our house is already wired for network so it was as easy as patching from the router to one of these switches in the rec room and then plug the TV and Blu-Ray in.  Now we're streaming movies, music and Blu-Ray content with no hiccups and a painless installation!  Top it off with us purchasing it at a low price along with a $10 rebate and this couldn't be beat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Working Perfectly For Our Needs", "unixReviewTime": 1294876800, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2011"}
