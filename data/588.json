The web browser only works on wifi.  Anyway, I really like the Nook. I bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the \"my b&n library\" with \"my documents\" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my \"mysteries\" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the \"documents\" set or the \"B&N\" set.  I think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option (only an option since some people probably like it the way it is).  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be but not unmanageable.  I haven't used the library yet but have gotten epub books elsewhere (the epub ability is the reason I chose Nook over Kindle even though there are a lot more free Kindle books).  Overall, yes I would recommend a Nook but I would have gone for the cheaper wifi version had I known that the 3g was useless to me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like it but....", "unixReviewTime": 1305158400, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2011"}
