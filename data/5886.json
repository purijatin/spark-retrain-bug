I have 5 port modem/switch from Verizon for my internet and needed more lines hooked up in my house then just the 5.  So took this, plugged into the modem/switch and bang, 4 more ports, nothing else to do.  If you need to expand your wired device this is a great addition.  Just plug it in and your all set to go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product", "unixReviewTime": 1368576000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2013"}
