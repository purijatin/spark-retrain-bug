Mccarthy \"TJ\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I recently replaced my cable provider with AT&T;'s UVERSE, a combination of internet, cable TV, and telephone.  My PCs and other devices were hooked together with a Linksys network, but the installer told me that the Linksys devices wouldn't work properly with his equipment, and everything had to hook directly into the AT&T; box.  After pulling lots of cable, he hooked up 4 devices, and that was it.  Everything else had to be wireless, or I was told to get a Netgear switch.  After some internet research I found I could probably get the Linksys to work, but the Netgear was reasonably priced and should be worry-free.Sure enough, the install took all of 5 minutes, including swapping cables from the AT&T; box to the Netgear box.  Everything worked perfectly, no problems encountered or adjustments needed.If you have UVERSE, and need more ports for your devices, this is just what you're looking for.  If only all networking problems were this easily solved!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The UVERSE Preferred Solution", "unixReviewTime": 1275523200, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2010"}
