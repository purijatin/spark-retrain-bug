The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy to install.  Wire managment is not the best.", "unixReviewTime": 1331078400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2012"}
