For switch to hide behind your equipment I would recommend. The ability to mount this on a wall is a plus for cluttered equipment situations.Ok I'm back! Its now 3 years later and........still going strong I'll have to change this to 5 stars, cisco switches are good for one year. I would suggest picking up the gigabit version with 8 ports, leave room to grow this piece of equipment will out last most items you will be plugging into it :).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Well Built", "unixReviewTime": 1285977600, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2010"}
