I plugged a PS3, xbox360, two computers, and our DSL cable (all ethernet cables) into this switch and now all four systems have internet connection.  It was that simple!My only regret is that I got didn't get the 8-port switch.  I didn't realize that the DSL connection goes in one of these front 5 ports.  I thought perhaps there was a port in the back (similar to a USB hub). I was hoping to have one port available to plug a laptop in, but the four systems and DSL connection uses all five available ports.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Doesn't get much easier than this!", "unixReviewTime": 1232668800, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2009"}
