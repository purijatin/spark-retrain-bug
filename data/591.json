HOWEVER - I'd say i made a huge mistake. I loved the way the Nook worked, but reliability becamea huge issue. My first Nook died within 24 hours. I figured it was just a bad egg, took it back, and they completely replaced it with a brand new one. My second one died 6 months later. I took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it. Since it is still under warranty, They advised I call or email.  Over the last 3 months, I've sent several emails and get auto-responses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual, please call. I've also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over, or my toddler starts wanting my attention, etc... I guess I'll just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a Kindle!!!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't waste your money!", "unixReviewTime": 1298246400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011"}
