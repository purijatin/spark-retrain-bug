I received my FS105 v2 this week (in September 2010), and as another reviewer from this month noted, the power connection is flaky. The power cord disconnects, and the unit powers off, whenever I move either the unit or the cord. I returned my first one for a replacement, and the second unit has the same problem, so it's going back for a refund. The serial numbers from my defective units are 1D52073B01659 and 1D52073G02579.Thank you Amazon for your excellent return/replacement procedure.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Check review dates: Latest batch has defective power connection", "unixReviewTime": 1285200000, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2010"}
