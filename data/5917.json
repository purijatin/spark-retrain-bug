What more can you say?Some of the reasons I selected this unit include the metal housing (which makes the unit a little heavier and less likely to slip around) and the co-location of the status LEDs with the jacks.Be sure to check the dates on other reviews as some of them are just plain wrong.  For example, this most recent version/model does NOT have an \"Uplink\" selector switch...the ports configure automatically if you need to uplink to another switch or router.  Also, the power connector is NOT a right-angle connector on this unit.One last note...this unit uses a 7.5 VDC power supply, so it will not work with all those older 12 VDC Netgear power supplies you have lying around.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Be sure to check the date of the review....", "unixReviewTime": 1262736000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2010"}
