The  hot keys are great for internet surfing and for listening to media files  such as Winamp.  I also plugged my Intellimouse Optical into the USB ports  in the back and did not have to use a valuable USB port in the back of my  machine.  I would suggest this keyboard to anyone who likes the ergonomic  feel and who spends a lot of time on the internet and listening to or  watching media.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Keyboard...By Far", "unixReviewTime": 967593600, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2000"}
