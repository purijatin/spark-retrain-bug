I have some books with i purchased are in PDF. Plus i have some word documents which i have converted to PDF. Both in my books and in my Word-Converted-PDF files have lot of pictures. Lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures. When i read them in nook, The letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small. When i try to increase the font size, it does not work. IT WORKS ONLY FOR TEXTS! I Have never used kindle so don't know if the issue is there in kindle too. Also the PDF Pages are scattered all over the place. 1 Page in actual PDF file appears as 3 pages sometimes with a blank page in between. Not sure what is causing this.MY Nook does have a Web Browser but it only works with WI-FI, Not with the 3G. In 3G you can ONLY interact with BarnesandNobles.comThe touch screen response and user-friendliness are OK. Not great, After dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use now-a-days.Go for it (And Kindle) if you are reading Text only book with very little or no graphics. AMAZON and B&N; Needs to improve their products and i am sure they will!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "E-READERS ARE FOR NOVEL READERS ONLY??", "unixReviewTime": 1299801600, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2011"}
