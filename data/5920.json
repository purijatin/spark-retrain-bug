I love the &quot;blue buttons&quot; I realy only use the Volume Play/Pause, Prev Track, Next Track, this is awsome with winamp. Another great thing are the USB ports on  the back (the keyboard is a USB hub), that is where I have my mouse  connected. The only thing that I would change on the keyboard is that the  keys should press a bit less like the IBM keyboard or keyboards on some  laptops. Another shortcomming is that it is very thick, and it will not fit  in the keyboard drawer built into my desk when the legs are put up.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Keyboard!", "unixReviewTime": 956880000, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2000"}
