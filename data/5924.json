The new and improved keyboard has better key action than the original, the space bar has been enlarged for those of us that type like normal users and not like professional developers. My reason for purchasing the Natural Keyboard Pro over the MS Natural Keyboard Elite was mainly due to the fact that the ARROW Keys are NORMALLY SIZED. With the Natural Keyboard Elite, the arrow keys are scrunched into this diamond shape near the keypad. When I went to use them, I would continuously hit all of them at once causing all sorts of chaos and verbal malediction to be uttered by yours truly.The hot keys are a nice feature, but I rarely use them, except for the Sleep and Calculator Keys. The software included does allow you to customize the Mail, My Computer and Calculator keys so you can reassign them to launch any app, batch file or .PIF that you want. The software also allows you to turn off the Windows Keys on either the left or right side and most importantly it allows you to turn off the Application Key (which can be annoying if you're trying to play games, etc..)To sum, it's a great keyboard, easy to install, setup and customize. If you have an original MS Natural Keyboard, you will love this one. If you've got big hands, buy this one and skip the Natural Elite.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Improvement on Perfection!", "unixReviewTime": 945216000, "reviewTime": "12 15, 1999"}
