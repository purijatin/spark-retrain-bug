However, I have one rather large complaint to make: When typing certain words, namely those that end in &quot;nce,&quot; the letter u mysteriously appears at the end of it.  I have tested my theory with numerous words, and they all seem to end with a u, even though it wasn't typed.  This appears to happen when I'm typing at a fast pace.  I am going to see if this is just a defect and see if I can get another one.  Otherwise, just a mixed positive/negative review.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "*NOT* recommended for fast typers", "unixReviewTime": 1028419200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2002"}
