Lauterbach \"chadl2\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "This is a great keyboard, and my hands have felt better since the day I got it.  However, I excpected it to be a USB keyboard, which it is not, and I thought the USB ports could support all devices, which it can't.  The primary reason I own a keyboard is for typing, so I think that should be the focus.  This is a great keyboard to type on, and I recomend it for that purpose.  I also find the hotkeys extremely well placed, and choosen.  They are very usefull. The USB functionality is only semi-useful (hence the four stars).  I couldn't make all my devices work well on it, nor is it a USB keyboard (it still needs the PS/2 port).  Neither of these things were huge downfalls for me, but the were annoying, as it was not what I was excpecting.  I do highly recommend this for typing, but if you absolutely need USB functionality, buy a USB hub.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I love to type on it, everything else is only OK.", "unixReviewTime": 983923200, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2001"}
