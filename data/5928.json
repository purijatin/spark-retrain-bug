I bought two last year and gave one to my aunt; if it were possible to fall in love with a keyboard, then this thing would steal my  heart.The Natural Keyboard Pro is the true successor to the original  Natural Keyboard; forget about the Keyboard Elite.  This board sports 19  multimedia &quot;hot keys&quot; that launch browsers, refresh web pages,  and much more.  There are connectors for USB and PS/2 ports; Microsoft  recommends plugging the keyboard into both ports although you can use  whatever port you want.Key response is good without feeling mushy and  the built-in wrist rest is good for those users who like to relax theirs  wrists at the bottom of the keyboard.  The IntelliType software that ships  with the keyboard is version 1.0; users of America Online will want to  download the patch for compatibility with AOL's 5.0 software.I like  Microsoft's latest keyboard.  It's a good, sturdy keyboard with cool  features that are really useful.  Users with small hands might need some  time to get used to the board's rather large layout; even still the Natural  Keyboard Pro is proof that if Microsoft quit the software business tomorrow  they'd have a great future in hardware.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best ergonomic keyboard on the planet.", "unixReviewTime": 956707200, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2000"}
