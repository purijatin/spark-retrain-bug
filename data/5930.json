I bought one at a local second-hand store for $3.83 and am happy with it.  The keys are rather loud and clickty-clack but its study.  The blue bottons on the top arent that useful.  But its a very comfortable keyboard to use.  I like the wrist rest especially and the space-bar works well.  I like the USB ports on the KB, I plug my USB mouse into one and the other is free for now.  Highly recommended if you can find one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good KB", "unixReviewTime": 1184371200, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2007"}
