I have the Dell verision (\"Dell by Microsoft\"), which I think is the same as the original Microsoft one,but just has \"Dell\" branded on the right corner.  It is a good, sturdy keyboard, however, it is very loud.  The other keyboards I have (4 of them) are not half as loud as this one.  I just bought a new Microsoft Erognomic keyboard for my wife, and it is very nice, quiet.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Keyboard works well but VERY LOUD", "unixReviewTime": 1164412800, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2006"}
