I use many diffrent keyboards (at school, friends house, laptop) and none of them compare to this keyboard. When I first started using this keyboard I was a &quot;hunt and peck&quot; typist but over time I became a touch typist and this keyboard is perfect for that. I dont have any pain using it for hours at a time (compared with other keyboards). I would recommend this keyboard to anyone. The two USB ports are also a great feature since I plug my Microsoft Intellimouse Optical (a fantastic mouse) into it and it reduces wire clutter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best keyboard ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1031702400, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2002"}
