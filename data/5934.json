Once you put the time into using it, typing on it for hours at a time is definitely easier on the hands. It does have a clackity clack sound when typing and I had to make a special wrist support pad (2 by 4 cut with a bandsaw to fit the contours and a gel pad on top). The keyboard is roomier (and larger) and I learned to touch type on it. Put small felt dots on the F and J keys to make it easier to get your fingers on the home keys.With the new Intellikeyboard software, I remapped all of the  gray buttons to things like Word, Explorer, cut, copy, paste, next application, open, close, exit, print and more! Its like having the new MS office keyboard with the ergo that I crave.I simply cannot type on a slab anymore. Too cramped, too quiet, and too painful.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "With the right wrist support and practice, the best.", "unixReviewTime": 1032393600, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2002"}
