Turns out my hoarding was appropriate given their next offering, the  Natural Keyboard Elite, was such a disappointment.  So it was with great  pleasure I found, after snapping one up on release day, that the third  time's a charm.  First off, it retains the split design of its forebears  which is so much easier on the wrists.  The control buttons across the top  are a nice addition, I use the media controls the most when playing songs  in Winamp, and poke the larger email button to launch Outlook2k.  The  Internet browser controls are of less use if you have grown accustomed to  navigation using regular keystrokes, they're tougher to get to rather than  just a quick F5 etc.  The travel between key presses has been lessened, so  you don't have to push as far on, say, the ctrl button to activate it as  you did in the first version.  This tends to produce a little cushier  typing experience but it's worth it. They also returned the beloved  inverted T arrow controls, instead of the horrid cross of the Elite.  This  design is preferable when playing games w/out joysticks or mice like a  quick round of Mame32 emulated Pac-Man.  Should also mention the presence  of the two USB ports in the back for mouse/trackball use.  The keyboard  itself comes w/ a dual USB/PS/2 connector and is physically smaller than  the original.  Being on computers 10+ hours a day I have this keyboard and  the Logitech Marble Trackman FX [see review] on all my machines, work and  home. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Finally a Worthy Successor to the Original", "unixReviewTime": 960076800, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2000"}
