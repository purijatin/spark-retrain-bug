It took about and hour or two to get used to the split keyboard, but it was smooth sailing after that. The only problem that I had (which was resolved a few hours after use), was the quieter key action when typing. It does not take much pressure to type on the keyboard, which is a bit of change for me. This was however, resolved a few hours after use.I find that my hands and fingers get fatigued less often than with my previous keyboard, just a standard flat keyboard. I've also noticed that my typing speed has increased, being that it is more comfortable to type. What I really like about the keyboard is the shortcut keys, a must-have feature for any keyboard. I do not use many USB devices, but when I do, it is very handy to have 2 ports right at the keyboard.The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro is an excellent product, after the short 'learning curve', it allowed me to type faster, and more comfortably than ever before. I would recommend this to anyone who expirences any type of fatigue when using a traditional flat-style kayboard, or would rather type more naturally (hence the name ;).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comfortable and Easy to Use", "unixReviewTime": 993513600, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2001"}
