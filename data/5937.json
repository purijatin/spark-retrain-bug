That is the case with this product.  My keyboard rests in a drawer and the buttons at the top of the b61-00002 keyboard sometimes hit the top of the drawer starting my email program etc.  Plus, I could never get the 2 USB ports to work properly.  Finally, I don't type any faster on the &quot;natural&quot; keyboard and when friends and relatives use it, they complain bitterly.  I should have stuck with a simple keyboard with all of these bells and whistles.  My mistake.  Not Microsoft's.  But think about this before you buy this product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A bit more than I needed", "unixReviewTime": 1003276800, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2001"}
