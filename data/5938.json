Hines", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I found that I can type far faster on this keyboard than I can on a straight keyboard, which was a pleasant surprise.  I expected it to be more comfortable to use (and it is), but the speed increase was a nice bonus.  The keys have just the right amount of resistance for high speed typing.Of course, the standard warning about this kind of keyboard is:  ONLY BUY A \"NATURAL\" KEYBOARD IF YOU ARE A TOUCH TYPIST!  If you hunt and peck, you will HATE this keyboard.The multi-function keys are a really nice touch.  Best of all, they work without you having to do a lot of setup.  ;-)This keyboard can be connected to your computer via the USB port, OR the PS2 port, OR both.  That's really important, because all the information I could find on this keyboard never made this quite clear.  For me, it was crucial that ONLY the USB connection be required for my laptop, because my laptop has no keyboard connector whatsoever.  For my desktop, I have both USB and PS2, so I went ahead and plugged in both.If you only have USB, you will not be able to use your keyboard until the machine has booted at least up to the Windows password prompt.  If you have a BIOS password, and you are not using the PS2 connector, you will have to enter the password another way (like by using the irritating, mushy keyboard built into your laptop).One complaint that I have is that it is very hard to use the CTRL keys.  You have to get your hands pretty far out of home position to hit them, and it's awkward.  I write software for a living, and I use CTRL characters all the time, so I find this a bit annoying.However, overall I find the experience to be supperior to using a straight keyboard.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nearly doubled my typing speed", "unixReviewTime": 997228800, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2001"}
