Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).  All in all, worth the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great device", "unixReviewTime": 1278547200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2010"}
