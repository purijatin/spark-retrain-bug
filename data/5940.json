I have severe tendonitis, and it's a lifesaver. Both the layout of the keys and the key action (softer than normal) contribute to the increased comfort.I am a &quot;keyboard person&quot; (as opposed to being a mouse user), and I use the cursor (arrow) keys a lot. I tried to use the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, but found its diamond arrangement and smaller-than-normal cursor keys impossible to get used to. This keyboard has the keys in the traditional inverted-T layout. If you EVER use the cursor keys, spend the extra money for this Pro model instead of the Elite!I also really appreciate the Intellitype software that comes with the keyboard. It used to drive me crazy to accidentally hit the Caps Lock key. With the Intellitype software, you can disable the Caps Lock entirely (among many other customizations) -- problem solved!So why didn't I give this product 5 stars? Two reasons: first, the function keys are smaller than normal. I would've preferred them to be full size. Second, the hot keys are dark blue with icons molded into them. The problem is that the icons are not easily visible at a glance. It would've been far better to paint the icons white for high contrast and easy legibility. As it is, it's annoying that i have to scan the buttons to find the one I want. Good idea, poor execution.Still even with these minor flaws, I love this keyboard and heartily recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1011052800, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2002"}
