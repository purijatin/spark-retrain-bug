The programmable keys are pretty good (it'd be nice if more than a few were customizable).  My biggest complaint - and it's a big one - is that I've found the Intellitype software (which allows you to program the keys) to be a cause of keyboard system errors (hello blue screen).  It's done this multiple times on my Dell WinME system, to the point where I had to get rid of Intellitype for good (the piece of junk - this was the WinME version 1.2).  I just use the keyboard without the programmable features, and I like it.  However, if I were doing it again I'd get a cheaper (non-programmable) model and save money. Get whatever keyboard has the most comfortable keys for you - Microsoft has competitors too.  I know this, Intellitype isn't going anywhere near my system again.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "OK, flawed software", "unixReviewTime": 977788800, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2000"}
