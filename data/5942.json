This keyboard fit the bill perfectly. I now  use this keyboard both at home and at work. It's a tired analogy, but it  rings true here: using this keyboard is like trying on that pair of jeans  that fit you just right. You won't want to go back to anything less.Everyone asks the same question: isn't this keyboard hard to get used  to? I too thought it would take weeks, but I was comfortable with it after  two days (~8 hrs/day). I find the built-in wrist rest to be quite good and  the row of multi-media keys are a nice bonus feature (great to be able to  mute your music or adjust the volume with a quick keypress, especially if  you use headphones).No regrets, but there are two downsides you should  be aware of: 1) you may become more sensitive to non-ergonomic keyboards (I  get aches after using any cramped laptop keyboard now; normal keyboards are  still ok, just less comfortable) , and 2) the re-arrangement of the  function keys makes them a bit of a chore to get used to.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A compulsory computer component", "unixReviewTime": 967939200, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2000"}
