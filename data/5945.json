This is the best, and most comfortable keyboard I have ever used.  I am a very fast touch typist, with a very heavy touch since I learned on mechanical typewriters (remember those?  Not even an electrical assist.).  This keyboard lets me go faster, gives me far, far less fatigue and repetitive stress pain than any other, and ought to be the standard.As I said, I bang the keys pretty hard.  The Natural Keyboard Pro just keeps on working happily; mine is at least 5 years old and going strong.  Normally I bash an IBM or Dell (or any other) keyboard into destruction within a year.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best keyboard ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1115596800, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2005"}
