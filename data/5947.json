A clean, traditional key layout with shortcut buttons that actually work thanks to the excellent Intellitype software.  The key response is the best I've used since the old IBM keyboards of the 1980's.  The keys are solid, stiff and emit a nice tactile click when you press them.  You won't find any keyboard flex or mushy/spongy key response that you'll find in some of the cheaper, no-name keyboards you can buy [elsewhere] for [less].  Microsoft has done their homework with this one!The included wristrest completes this great setup.  If you're looking for a basic keyboard and don't require dozens of quickstart keys or the latest RF/wireless model, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better than this one.  Take it from me, I use mine all day at work and at home on my own PC!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great keyboard!  Best tactile feedback ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1026864000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2002"}
