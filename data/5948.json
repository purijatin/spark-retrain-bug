Guess \"Jared\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The Standard MS Keyboard has that tactile feel that most modern keyboards lack.  Go look on ebay for the keyboards from the 80's.. They carry a HIGH premium because of how they were made.. how the keys sound, respond, and feel.  This is not as good as that.. but it's much better than most anything you will find in stores now.  I'm not sure why they don't go back and at least offer one of the 80's style keyboards for say $100 in their line up.  It makes typing SO much easier, quicker, and more pleasant.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great feel", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}
