As far as the keyboard itself...it is absolutely wonderful.  You won't get the tactile feel of most keyboards as this is a very light typer...I love that though as a personal choice.  New  keyboards tend to take some getting used to but this one required  practically no time at all.  The only thing it really is missing, to me, is  audio control built in.  Now this may not be the idea of this type of KB at  all, but it would have been a real nice addition...even at the cost of  $5-10 extra.  It still would have been more than worth this price.Now,  don't buy this here.  Keep in the game Amazon or take this off  your site because your not doing anyone any favors at this price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great keyboard...wrong place to buy.", "unixReviewTime": 958521600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2000"}
