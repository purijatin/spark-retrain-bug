I've got four of them... two at work and two at home. They never seem to wear out like other keyboards and take a considerable beating. Once, a coworker was helping me move my desk and put my keyboard on the floor. He began picking up the monitor (a 17&quot;), but it slipped out of his hands and landed on the poor keyboard. A dozen keys shot off and the little 'feet' on the bottom of it snapped out. That was six months ago... that same keyboard is still in my office and working PERFECTLY. You can't beat that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great, Durable Keyboard", "unixReviewTime": 998524800, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2001"}
