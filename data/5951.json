I feel in love with the touch on it while testing it out there. All was well for years. Then one morning my cat knocked my mug of coffee over and it poured all down right into the keyboard. I had no hopes to finding a replacement, but did. It arrived quickly, same old keyboard in stunning new shape. I should buy another. Keyboards with a nice touch are very difficult to come by. The programmed button shortcuts are handy too. Can not say a bad thing about it. I'm not much for wrist rests but I even like the one that comes with this keyboard. It is a PS/2 Interface, which means it's the round plug in, not the rectangular USB one. Make sure you have an PS/2 to usb adopter on hand if you don't have a PS/2 Interface.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Microsoft Internet Keyboard", "unixReviewTime": 1348012800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2012"}
