I really do not use the &quot;internet&quot; keys, but i really like the calculator key, seeing how im always looking to do a quick calculation.It might not be as quite as other keyboards, but the keys feel fine to push, and after years they have not broke or got stikky, and i have used it alot Daily.The arm rest is the best feature, along with the Huge spacebar.  The keys feel very natural, and i like how they slope up.  Well worth the money.~hope this helps", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good.", "unixReviewTime": 1037836800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2002"}
