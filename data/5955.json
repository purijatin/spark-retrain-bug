My box requires a metal bracket that goes across diagonally where there is a screw hole in the middle, this product requires a box where there are 4 screws at each point of the square.The product is also all plastic, very cheap, but that's not really a knock since it's also very cheaply priced.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Wasn't able to use, not compatible with my electrical box", "unixReviewTime": 1354665600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2012"}
