It works very well but has a narrower sense angle than the newer model that I purchased at over twice the price at Home Depot. The one from Amazon seems to be an older model on clearance.I also added a simple AC powered audible beep alarm to this Heath Motion Sensing Light, so now it emits a single moderately loud \"beep\" whenever the Zenith / Heath sensor detects an intrusion and the flood lights come on. This modification required connecting an external home brew \"beeper box\" between the two red and neutral wires coming out of the rear of the unit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good price for a quality item", "unixReviewTime": 1348617600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2012"}
