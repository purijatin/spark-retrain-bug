The older unit was from a different manufacturer, but looked identical and carried the same model number.  Installation was straightforward--I simply removed the existing wire nuts, removed the old unit from the light housing, and reversed the process to install the new one.  It works dependably, as advertised.This was a much cheaper option than buying a new motion flood light fixture.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent replacement sensor for outdoor motion flood light", "unixReviewTime": 1364169600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2013"}
