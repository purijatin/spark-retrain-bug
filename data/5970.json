Zimmerman \"bezimmer\"", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "Bought three of these to detect motion around the deck and pool area and activate several flood lights and wall sconce units simultaneously. The instructions say this has to be wired to a switched circuit, but I have no idea why. Worked fine coming right off a live circuit. Coverage is probably a little less than 180d  but it worked well for me.The instructions don't cover this... If you want to add multiple sensors to a single (or multiple lights) simply get some 14/3+G wire and wire it up like you would a 3 way switch (or get an electrician to do it). I love the idea that we've got such broad motion detection coverage from the three sensors and all the lighting works simultaneously. Little more complicated (and expensive) wiring job, but much better for me than having individual units that work independently.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked great for me", "unixReviewTime": 1346112000, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2012"}
