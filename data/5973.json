It was an easy replacement (TURN THE BREAKER OFF FIRST).  The unit has sensitivity adjustment and instructions as to angle so you neighbor does not light your yard while getting his newspaper 600 feet away.  It has worked very reliable for several months in some nasty weather.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to install and reliable.", "unixReviewTime": 1394668800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2014"}
