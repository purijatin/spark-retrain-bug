I started out with this one and a 300 watt halogen rectangular light. The sensor worked but the 300 watt halogen did not put out enough light for my cameras. I removed both and installed an \"all in one\" \"sensor + light\" combo with screw in bulbs so I could use two 150 watt par 38 GE flood light screw in bulbs.
