I thought I would have to buy the whole unit, but glad they sell just the sensor.Box said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch, but I didn't. I don't understand why that was needed.The original sensor came with a green ground wire...this sensor does not. Not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anyway.This sensor turns the light on Full bright RIGHT NOW. My original sensor ramped up the light over a second or two.No directions, so just pay attention...white to white, black to black and red to red. Pretty strait forward.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It worked", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}
