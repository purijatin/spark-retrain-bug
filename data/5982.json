I wanted both to come on when letting my dogs out at night since they lit both side and rear areas of my yard but the rear one would not trip unless it saw enough motion in front of it which was generally seldom. So I wired this one into the side of the shed after replacing it with a standard lamp holder and wired the second lamp holder to the rear of the shed with it. Now, both fixtures light as soon as you step off the deck lighting the whole yard up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Replaced 2 sensors with one", "unixReviewTime": 1366934400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2013"}
