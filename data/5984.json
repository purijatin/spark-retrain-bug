My original Zenith sensors became erratic after 5 years outside here in Colorado.  Also those sensors were the &#34;dual brite&#34; type, a feature I never liked or used.  This new sensor seems more solidly built - heavier and well sealed against weather.  To replace the sensor I removed the entire light from the fixture box, unscrewed the sensor from the plate and cut the 3 color coded wires.  Then I matched the colors of the new sensor to the wires I just cut, black - black , white - white and brown - red.  My sensor came with a brown wire not a red wire as the match to the red wire of the light.  I used simple insulated crimp connectors - available at any big box store, possibly even Wal-Mart.Then installation was the reverse of removal.  Before you put the light back on the fixture box, align and aim the lights and sensor as best you can, its easier to do it at the work bench than up on a ladder.  One small drawback, my lights are white and the sensor brown, so its a mismatch in color.  I would have ordered a white, but did not see one offered.  its does not bother me but someone concerned with exterior color matching might want a white sensor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Replacement For Original", "unixReviewTime": 1390780800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2014"}
