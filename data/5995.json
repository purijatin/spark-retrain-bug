So, I decided to purchased this 25ft cable which arrived promptly. Unlike others on the market that are flimsy, this one is of good quality and works just as advertised.  I'd definitely recommend it to my friends or anyone who's looking for a phone extension.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Product", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}
