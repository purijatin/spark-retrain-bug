I never even ran phone traffic over the cord!  but it worked great for extending the circuit between the control panel and the inverter - the LCD still shows the data display, and the on/off switch still works normally even with the inverter 25 feet from its normally built in controller.  For the price, I could not be happier - it came fast and solved a complex problem with very little money spent.Alot of things use modular jacks in audio, telephone, key systems, etc.  Just be sure the number of wires matches (there are 3 versions of this plug - the 2 wire-uncommon, the 4 wire-common inc this one, and the 6 wire-uncommon but used in alarm systems quite a bit.When remodeling a modular extension may allow you to move your alarm keypad to the other side of a new door or have some other feature panel that uses a 4 wire modular plug moved.BEWARE some extensions reverse the wires - e.g. the rightmost wire on the plug is now the leftmost on the jack - while this will work with phones, it wont work on gear meant to use straight through wired plug/jack extensions.  I.e. using an ohm meter you should see the leftmost contact on the plug makes a nearly 0 ohm connection with the leftmost contact on the jack, and not to any other wires in the jack.Great accessory for phones too!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another use - extend control panels on modular jack systems", "unixReviewTime": 1356048000, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2012"}
