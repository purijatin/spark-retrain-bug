The output is the expected ultra-crisp black on white and, according to the maker, the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces. In 'real life' the labels stickiness do meet my standards but I'll have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objects.Overall... nice labels.Made in Belgium.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Crisp, sticky labels", "unixReviewTime": 1298419200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011"}
