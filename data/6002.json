I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print, peel, and stick type of label with no mess and crisp, professional-looking fonts.  This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review, I saved a little over $10 as the price I paid on Amazon was $14.34 vs. $24.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Label and $10 Cheaper Here than at Office Depot", "unixReviewTime": 1341014400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2012"}
