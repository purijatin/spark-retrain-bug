I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars. While the print holds up to the frequent handling, the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles. No matter how carefully I clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other (and sometimes both).They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps.I am disappointed with this product, but haven't found anything better.BTW - The metallic tape was no better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good...if They Stick", "unixReviewTime": 1228953600, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2008"}
