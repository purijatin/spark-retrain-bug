From school supplies to putting my name and number on my expensive electronics just in case it gets stolen.  Not only are these great for everything in the house or office, but amazon is also the cheapest place you can get these.  Walmart has them at a higher price.  Also if you're a prime member, these ship prime if you have more than 25 dollars in your cart.  I can not emphasize enough; get refills. If you're like me, I use this daily and go through these like water. You won't regret these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best purchases I've ever bought in my entire life", "unixReviewTime": 1398470400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2014"}
