All because I wanted to know why my the touch screen on my nook stopped responding to input.Then I called and was literally cussed (f word) at a minute in for asking about what was wrong with their live chat. Maybe I was just really unlucky and the person I talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something, but I still find it unacceptable.Seriously, go with a kindle or something else instead. Amazon's customer service has always been well above average for me.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Customer service is the worst that I have ever encountered", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}
