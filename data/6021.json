However, I find that the white color of the labels does not hold up in light-exposed areas (even indirect light).When I moved into a new home, I applied these labels to light switch wallplates so that I wouldn't need to guess what the switches do. The labels adhere well, and after a year, none peeled or fell off. Sadly, however, the white unprinted areas of the labels have begun turning yellow or tan, and even brown-ish in rooms that receive lots of light.  None of the labels are exposed to direct sunlight, only light that bounces around the room from windows.I'm a bit disappointed with the poor longevity of these labels. Soon, I will need to remove and reprint my labels because a brown label looks pretty bad on a white wallplate. Thankfully, because the labels are made of plastic, they usually pull off in one piece without leaving much residue.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Light exposure turns the white labels yellow/brown", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2014"}
