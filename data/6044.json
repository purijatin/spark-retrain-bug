If I use one of the larger fonts on my LetraTag label maker, I can see the type from across the room. That is very handy to identify items or if an item is on a shelf, where it might otherwise be difficult to view.I like the background because there are not many packages or other items that have this shade as their background. That makes these labels standout. They are easy to identify as something I have labeled. In addition, I label everything, from the contents of a cabinet shelf, to boxes and bins I do not want to open (pre-label, I would have opened a bin 15 times to determine its contents - no longer), to file folders, to the back of all my electronics in case I lose one. That is just the tip of the iceberg.These labels are easy to apply, the rear of each labels backing is split in two so it is effortless. If I need to trim a label, I peel away the backing first and then use a pair of scissors to trim up without the backing. I found that if I kept trimming the labels with the backing on, I could not find the \"split\" on the back of my labels trimmed. Since cutting most labels is quick and easy, trimming with the back off does not deter from the adhesiveness of the label.I have had no problem with these Dymo labels adhering to any surface. Moreover, the labels hold firmly in place, regardless of temperature variations. I use a lot of this LetraTag tape, and I have found Amazon's price to be the best. On all variations of the LetraTag tape, their price is always the lowest.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy - Makes Items Easy to Identify", "unixReviewTime": 1345161600, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2012"}
