I am probably returning both models that I purchased. The more expensive model (QX50) has a Qwerty keyboard, but prints horribly, if at all. On a single line of bold text, it printed just about nothing. It prints 2-lines of normal text, with contrast set at the highest level, very irregularly. You can see some letters but not others. This is supposed to be their newer model. The next level down (a few bucks less) looks more like a calculator in it's design; long and narrow (N10926?). It prints really well; very crisp letters even just at regular contrast. Unfortunately in 2-line mode it will not center the lines, has less symbols (I need inch marks), and requires 6 batteries to the other model's 5. (Perhaps the extra power makes it print better though?) I'm pretty disappointed. The tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make. LetraTag tapes provide only 13 feet of tape. I wanted to make labels for my garden stakes. I'm going to take a look at the Brother and Casio lines of label makers and hope there's something better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Lettering is poor", "unixReviewTime": 1054684800, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2003"}
