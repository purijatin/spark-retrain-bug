I won't go into what's great about them, but when I was buying them, I couldn't find a good review to tell me which is better replay or TiVo. When I got ReplayTv I was a  little concerned because I read some bad things about it as compared to  TiVo.  The main reason I got it over TiVo is because it doesn't have that  ball and chain $10 a month charge TiVo has which adds up to $120 a year.  The bad things I heard about Replay were a loud fan (Which I couldn't hear  at all really.  If I turned everything off I heard a small tiny relaxing  hum, but I couldn't really tell if it was coming from my cable box or the  replayTv) And someone said that the replay box calls long distance on his  phone(I had the option of 3 to 5 local numbers in my area). Some people  also said that the software on TiVo is better, I don't really know, but  Replay updated their software, and it will download the latest version of  their software for you free. Also they say the remote is a better on TiVo.  I really liked the remote on the 2020, I didn't even need the instruction  manual to figure it out, and TiVo doesn't have the 30sec commerical skip  which is very useful. As far as features and software record time and  quality, I think they are both about equal, each have their strong points  and the differences are not noticable. I personally think that replay has  better features. But with ReplayTv your not stuck with that ball and chain  $10 monthly bill.So if your choosing between the 2, I say buy ReplayTv", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Must have.  Don't get TiVo", "unixReviewTime": 959126400, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2000"}
