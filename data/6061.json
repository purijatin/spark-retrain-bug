It terms of a review, I'd give Replay 2 stars, but Amazon.com 5 stars.  Amazon was very gracious about the return, and I will certainly buy electronics from them again.After two weeks  using Replay and Tivo, I'd agree with everything in Photokev's review from  11/26.  If Tivo didn't exist, I would have kept Replay, which is why I gave  it 2 stars.  Its just that Tivo is more reliable and has done a better job  bringing a great idea to market.My Replay suffered AV flashes, a  problem known about for a year which hasn't been solved despite several  software updates.  These are described by owners at avsforum.com, in case  you are interested.Tivo doesn't suffer this serious problem.  Also, its  ability to select programs to record based on what you have watched is one  of its best features.  I didn't believe that until I tried it, but it is  true.  In any case, I hope this helps.Finally, based on my return  experience, I can certainly recommend Amazon for electronics.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Replay 2 stars, Tivo 4, Amazon 5", "unixReviewTime": 943920000, "reviewTime": "11 30, 1999"}
