I'm not a TV guy (watch maybe 4 hours/month), yet already I've found myself skipping through commercials, creating a Telletubbies theme for my daughter, and discovering (good) shows that I'd have missd otherwise.* The company is clearly committed to its customers. I've had to call customer support; the folks were friendly and helpful. The set-up and user interface are clearly improving, and the program guide is easy to use.* As always, ...is a great place to buy this-- great price, and super-fast delivery.Now for the rest of the story.* Set-up is simple enough... if you're comfortable with, say, setting up a fax machine.* Usability is very good, but not quite excellent. I frequently find myself trying to remember the difference between \"Guide\" and \"Menu,\" or \"Input\" and (or just buy a wireless jack here.)In all, this is a great \"version 2\" product, where version 3 will be truly excellent. I highly, highly recommend it... but know that the next generation will smooth out those last few rough edges. Live a little and buy it now (really!)... it's fun to be a bit ahead of the curve.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Here's what you need to know about the Replay TV", "unixReviewTime": 947721600, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2000"}
