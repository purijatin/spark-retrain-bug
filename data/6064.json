The ReplayTV manual told me how I could work around this problem, but it looked like the workaround  would give me poorer picture and sound quality, so I sadly decided to  return the ReplayTV and wait until I get a new TV. If you own an ancient TV  and video, think twice about trying out the Replay. And, if you're about to  buy a new TV, make sure you get one with s-video to ensure best performance  with new gadgets like the Replay.Having said that, Amazon's service was  so good and its returns department so helpful, that it was no hassle to try  the machine out and then return it. If you're unsure about buying one, the  30-day return policy certainly makes it painless to check the system out.  Even though I didn't get to use the Replay, I was impressed by the manual  (I'm a documentation writer myself) and the easy setup guide.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazon service makes it safe to try", "unixReviewTime": 948240000, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2000"}
