I was skeptical at first, not even being a huge television watcher myself and now- just try to take my TiVo away! The things I love about TiVo are-  *Ease of use- you can record programs at the  touch of a button on the TiVo remote, there are no tapes, crouching on the  floor in front of the tv- difficult settings, etc.  It literally takes a  few seconds to set the TiVo to record an entire season worth of shows with  the 'season pass' feature. *Maximizing your viewing time- I record the  shows I like to watch when I have the time to watch them.  That means no  more coming home and surfing channels and settling on something just-okay.  I get to watch my favorite shows when I have time to watch them.  I can  also zip right through commercials with the fast forward button. *The  on-screen tv guide is another great feature- you can always find out what  will be on or when a show will be over without messing around trying to  find the tv guide. *Unlike a VCR you can watch things you have previously  recorded while recording another show!  I set the TiVo up myself and the  actual hardware hook-up took me about 5 minutes.  TiVo comes with every  possible connector you could need, I think- so there was no running to  Radio Shack to pick up a coax cable or what have you.  I had no problems  programming the remote to my television or making the set-up call, etc.  It  was very easy to do. I highly recommend this product.  It is well worth the  price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What you WANT to watch, WHEN you want to watch it!", "unixReviewTime": 947116800, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2000"}
