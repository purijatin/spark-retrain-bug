At $399 plus $10 per month for the programming, TiVo is my favorite.  OK, if I want to spend hours every week programming my VCR  (of which I own five), I can record all my favorite shows, but why bother  when TiVO does a much better job virtually automatically.  Since I  purchased Tivo in April, I haven't recorded anything on the VCR's.  I still  use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on DVD.  For  those of you that may complain about the $10/month (or $200 one time)  charge for the programming data service, I would suggest that this is a  minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv,  AND I would submit that the TiVo service will greatly enhance your ability  to utilize and manage the 50 to 250 channels that are available with cable  or satellite.Do I watch alot more TV than I did before?  Not really, but  now I always have something to watch that I'm interested in rather than  just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted.Did I consider  Replay?  Yes, also a nice product, but for my needs TiVO is better.  Will  the price drop by Christmas?  Probably, but at $399 why wait?  Enjoy it  today.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best  A/V Investment I've Made Since My Original Betamax", "unixReviewTime": 963446400, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2000"}
