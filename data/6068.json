Five stars because it's such an amazing product.On the negative side, the modem on my Tivo went dead in just six months. After reading all the Amazon reviews, it appears that this is a VERY common problem that can't be ignored. It wouldn't be so bad if the warranty weren't so short and if Philips/Tivo support weren't so completely incompetent. It's now been five weeks and they still haven't returned my Tivo -- even though I had to pay for them to fix it! I'm told the delay is because they ran out of refurbished units to send me. I don't find that an acceptable excuse.Since I still believe that Tivo is the most amazing invention since the personal computer, I still definitely recommend you buy one.  Besides, it's not Tivo, but Philips that seems to have the quality problem (I'm not sure how the Sony versions rate on quality).But there are some steps you should take if you buy one:First, buy the extended warranty plan that most stores offer. You'll pay extra, but it will still be less then paying $100 for Philips to fix it. And store warranties last 3 years, unlike the awful 3 months labor, 1 year parts warranty that you get from Philips.Second, buy a special power strip that includes inputs for cable and telephone lines. This will stop any power surges from hitting your Tivo, which is what I suspect is causing a lot of these failures. (My Tivo died after during a mild thunderstorm.)Good luck!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "READ THIS before you buy and SAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE!", "unixReviewTime": 1005609600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2001"}
