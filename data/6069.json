Their solution is to decide between using Tivo on &quot;A&quot; or  &quot;B&quot;.  And when I wanted to switch, it took a 2 hour set up.  Also, if your system requires a cable box you probably wont be able to  watch another channel while Tivo is recording. (you would need another  cable box or cable tuner of some sort)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Beware!!", "unixReviewTime": 967075200, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2000"}
