Brown \"Race Fan\"", "helpful": [44, 46], "reviewtext": "I started out about a year or so ago with a 14 hour Tivo unit and LOVED it.  The problem was they lie about capacity... sort of.  14 hours or in the case of the 30 hour unit are really more like 6 hours and 11 hours with the recorder set to record at BEST quality...  anything lower and the picture looks bad. I then paid Tivo to send me a new unit that had been upgraded to 3 hours.... Then that was still not enough time with the system set at best quality.I finally found out I could upgrade the thing myself... so my recomendation is to get the cheapest on that you can and upgrade it.  This VOIDS you tivo warrenty but hey we all like to live on the edge right :)I now have a 117 hour Tivo because the company I used to upgrade my Tivo ([...]) added an 80GB disk and now instead of having to delete my recordings early or being more picky about what I record I can go nuts and record anything and everything.  I even saw on one website ([...]) a guy who has a 151+ hour Tivo.Another good website for Tivo upgrade information is [...]  They have parts for sale and directions on how to upgrade your Tivo (The easiest is a 14 hour unit since you just add a &quot;blessed&quot; drive)happy Tivoing and hack away!PS If you can't tell I love this thing!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get the smallest cheapest Tivo you can and upgrade", "unixReviewTime": 980899200, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2001"}
