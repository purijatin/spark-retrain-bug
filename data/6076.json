I have a home theatre system, with all components (CD, DVD, Phono, Digital Cable Box, &amp; VCR) connected through a Yamaha top-of-the-line A/V receiver.  As none of the example set-ups in the TIVO manual remotely matched mine,  and despite the fact that normally I'm pretty good at this type of thing,  after about three hours of complete failure, I was positively stumped.  I  finally had to call TIVO's customer care support.  And this is where I am  SO very impressed!  I was absolutely blown away when the TIVO  representative stayed ON the phone for over an hour with me as I crawled  behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone,  with various cables in my teeth!  ;-)  She walked me through every step and  with persistence and effort on both our parts, finally we got everything  hooked up and &quot;talking to&quot; each other.  I've never experienced  customer service like this before on anything I've ever bought.  Amazing!  And as for the TIVO and how it is working now - great and I love it!  Only  thing I didn't like was the fact TIVO/Philips have truly overlooked the  customer's with home entertainment systems, calling a set up like mine,  &quot;advanced&quot; - from what I can tell more and more consumers are  going to the &quot;advanced&quot; systems so it would be good to see TIVO  include hookup examples for &quot;advanced&quot; systems in their future  product manuals.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazing Set-Up Assistance!", "unixReviewTime": 954720000, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2000"}
