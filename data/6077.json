This product has changed my television watching habits forever. Having only owned this model for a few weeks, I am already amazed at the change--now I can watch what I want to watch when I want to watch it and I never have to deal with programming a VCR again--in fact, I unhooked my VCR from my system!Amendment to this review: 8/29/01My Tivo automatically downloaded and installed its newest software, making a great product even better, if you can imagine. My favorite new feature is the ability to have your Tivo search out and record pograms by a very sophisticated set of search criteria. Amazing!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Will change your life!", "unixReviewTime": 971136000, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2000"}
