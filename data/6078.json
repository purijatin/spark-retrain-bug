TIVO tried to handle the problem by not letting us talk with Phillips directly.  Claimed they lost the unit, lost the credit card, credit card was expired (it wasn't), etc.  It was like the 'dog ate my homework' excuse everytime and then they said it was 48 hrs before they could get us an update.  2 months later, We finally had our unit back Friday, but by Sunday the TIVO service shutdown because the serial number was unknown to the computer.  Had to wait until Monday to fix it!  Buy Sony instead.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "TIVO is Great, Tivo support from Phillips is BAD!", "unixReviewTime": 1027900800, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2002"}
