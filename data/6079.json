When I powered on the unit, it took me a few seconds to realize  that my VCR input needed to be set to &quot;Line&quot; before I could see  the TiVo screens. The on-screen guided setup procedure went without a  hitch; the most difficult and time-consuming part was determining the  remote control codes to allow the TiVo remote to turn on both my TV and  Stereo system at the same time. I also had a few false starts configuring  the system to control my cable box. The first time TiVo dialed into the  main computer, the actual connection lasted only about 15 minutes, but TiVo  busily sorted and indexed the downloaded information for about 2 1/2 hours.  The system is so quiet, that if it weren't for the green light on the  front, I'd have no idea it was even powered on. The software and the  screens are well designed and very user friendly. I have friend who can  barely change the channels on his TV using a remote control, and he was  easily able to navigate the system and program it to record his favorite  shows (I've been giving demos to all of my friends). The system can  automatically update its own software every day, so I imagine there are  many more features coming soon. Everyone I show TiVo to has some great  suggestions for improvements, and I hope to see some of them in future  versions. To summarize in 2 words: Buy it. I admit I was skeptical at  first, but I'm a 100% TiVo fan now.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Everything it is advertised to be.", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
