The tivo is a simple product to use once you figure it out. It can record a whole season of a series or just one show which is very useful. Now the down side to it. When they say 30 or 60 hrs they are not telling the total truth. The number of hours of recording which are stated are for terrible quality recording. For the 30 hr Phillips tivo recorder, which I have, the good quality recording is only 9 hrs which is dramatically different. And another defect that annoys you sometimes is the mistakes of changing channels that it does sometimes. For example if I want channel 12 recorded for a little time it will change to channel 1 or 2 because the frequency isn't set perfectly on the cable box. This is an annoying part of the tivo. If there was an auto-frequency adjuster then that would be perfect. But again it is the time which really matters, tivo fools the customers into thinking they will have 30 hrs of perfect recording which is not true, but the settings of quality can be changed to multiple levels which increases the time available depending on the level. I hope you find this review helpful.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A TV lover's miracle", "unixReviewTime": 1007856000, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2001"}
