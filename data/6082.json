TIVO is the next thing after the vcr, once it catches on everyone will want it.Basically TIVO is a really smart VCR. You watch TV and use the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons on the remote to tell tivo what shows you like and don't like. TIVO uses these suggestions and an internal TV Guide that it downloads everyday to figure out what shows you might like to watch. TIVO uses all this info to determine shows that you might like and records them.TIVO also has features to manually record and a Season Pass feature. The Season Pass is a feature where you tell tivo the name of a show and then TIVO automatically records this show anytime it is on. TIVO is always on 24/7 so it never misses a show.Beyond these features TIVO also lets you pause live TV, do instant replays of live TV and a ton of other features.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best thing since sliced bread", "unixReviewTime": 975542400, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2000"}
