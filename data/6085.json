I'm glad that people are finally catching on to what I've been saying for over a year which is:  TIVO IS THE COOLEST THING EVER.  The main thing that I hear from people when I try to explain the benefits of owning a Tivo is &quot;But I have a VCR - why would I want this?&quot;  I have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a Tivo for you non-believers.1. I, too, own a VCR.  And with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that I wanted to see - I NEVER DID.2. Aren't you sick of missing your favorite TV shows?  With Tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again - in addition, my little Tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows.3. Don't you hate commercials as much as the next guy?  With Tivo, you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials.  You will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new Bud commercial...you'll merely shake your head and know that those poor, unfortunate souls don't have a Tivo at home.4.  Don't you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something?  I won't elaborate on that one - but wouldn't it be nice to pause your TV to jump up and answer the phone, grab a snack, etc... without having to worry about what you're going to miss.5.  You'll rent less movies.  Which also means that you'll save more money.  Forget renting.  Just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that you'd never watch that many movies.  Now you can watch them all.So, to sum up my little Tivo review - I have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch TV when you get a Tivo.  Stop torturing yourself with the network's schedule that doesn't fit your schedule and make up your own.  With Tivo there is always something good on...what YOU want to watch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tivo is the best invention since sliced bread", "unixReviewTime": 971222400, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2000"}
