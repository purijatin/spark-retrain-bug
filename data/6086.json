I love it, but the unit has hadit's share of problems. The warranty is ONLY 90 DAYS! My unit had problems with the IR receiver in the unit not receiving the commands. (Yes, it was the IR receiver as I have two remotes and neither worked unless you were 1-2 inches from the unit). It was over 90 days, but I had called several times on this issue and FINALLY got them to exchange it without charging me... But they do not ship the new unit until they receive the old unit.  I sent that to Texas... and received a new one within a week.  The second unit was what they called DOA (Dead on Arrival). It didn't work either. (It says refurbished on the bottom). So now I am sending it back at another shipping cost.  Another issue is that this receiver 'learns' programs, actors, directors, etc. that you like. So, with each exchange, I lose all of the info it has learned. All of this will lead me to send a letter to the President of Philips, but even getting his name took two calls. When I explained why I wanted his name to the person who answered in New York City she hung up on me...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "TiVo-Mine has died twice", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
