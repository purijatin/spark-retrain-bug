When  the lights blink off in the house, the TiVo tends to lock up, and this  'frozen state' can only be reversed by unplugging it for a few secs and  then plugging it back in and waiting for it to cycle through its start-up  menu (2 mins). 2) &quot;Pause&quot;, which is by far the coolest thing  about TiVo for me (like &quot;pizza guy knocks, don't want to miss this  next play&quot;), is pretty time-limited. After 30 mins of pause, it starts  playing again. Once it starts playing again, you cannot get all the way  back to where you paused it. 3) &quot;Record&quot; is nice, but nowhere  near 30 hours at any resolution you could stand to watch. Even at the best  resolution, the picture is seriously degraded from the original. 4) I'm  getting a little tired of the $9.95 per month. I know I agreed to it, but  it really seems a little too much, considering I paid for the hardware and  the menu (which is what the $9.95 is supposed to be for) is no better than  what my digital cable provider or DSS system provides.Overall, I like  it, but it should be improved before getting 5 stars from anyone.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Idea, Still Needs Work.", "unixReviewTime": 968112000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2000"}
