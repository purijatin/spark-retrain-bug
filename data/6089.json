I've had my Tivo for over a year now and I hate watching live TV.  Tivo does an excellent job of finding the shows that I'm interested in watching and then saves them for me so i can watch them when it's convenient for me.  No VCR in the world could do it as easily and quickly as my Tivo can.  Can your VCR search for shows starring a particular actor?  How about movies by a particular director?  Can your VCR search the next two weeks of listings for shows that match key words you set up?  No...it can't.  VCR's can't compare to Tivo.I don't watch more TV.  I watch better TV.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tivo is changing the way we watch TV", "unixReviewTime": 1011830400, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2002"}
