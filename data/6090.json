Set up wasn't too difficult ( dish network ) just a bit time consuming.  Problem is after 2-3 month the units modem fails to work.  It cannot dial into tivo central for programming data.  It has been a real frustrating situation - setting up 3 units, having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement. and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy! :-)  Im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit.  perhaps Ill have better luck.. Also have to say the 50 minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least - try doing it 4 or more times....", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "My unit has been replaced three times!", "unixReviewTime": 994377600, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2001"}
