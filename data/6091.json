I am not much of a TV junkie but TIVO has me hooked.  Like most people I put in a long day at the job.  It is so nice to come home and actually have something I like to watch.  I am a big Twilight Zone  Fan.  Most &quot;Zones&quot; air either in the middle of the night or  during working hours.  I set my TIVO up to give me a season pass to the  program.  When I come home after work there are always at least 2 episodes  recorded for me to watch.  The only problem that I have is that sometimes  the audio does not match the video.  It's sort of like watching an old  Godzilla movie.  I have to go to the menu and restart the receiver to fix.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "TIVO Creates Couch Potatoes", "unixReviewTime": 952732800, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2000"}
