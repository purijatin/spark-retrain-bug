But I've had my TiVo for over a year and haven't watched live TV since getting it. Why would I? With TiVo, when I turn on my TV I can choose from among watching programs I know I want to watch. I can jump over commercials. I can instant replay something I've missed. TiVo even learns what I like and suggests other programs I'd probably enjoy ... all while keeping my data confidential.I'm so keen on the product I've given two as gifts. We've had all sorts of gadgets in my home but NONE has taken over the way TiVo has. My daughters (7 and 11) and my wife are complete converts. The TiVo remote is the default for TV; we've stopped using our VCR. It's a killer product.Next stop? I'm going to buy some TiVo stock!
