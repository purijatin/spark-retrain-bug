For a first generation product it works extremely well.Pause live TV to go to make a snack or let the dog out and when you return you can watch the entire  show right where you left off and not miss a thing since its still  recording what's airing live.The Season Pass feature makes recording the  shows simple and head ache free. Don't worry about the networks moving  shows around since TiVo will automatically find the change and still record  them for you.TiVo learns your Favorites Shows by your rating of them and  will record shows based on the profile it builds on you. Don't worry, this  is all done in the box and the information is not sent to TiVo. So your  likes and dislikes remain private.TiVo is very simple to hook up to your  TV and telephone line. It normally takes less than 10 minutes to hook up.  You will have to program it upon the first use which will require a 2-3  hour call to a 1-800 number. You can leave TiVo unattended once it starts.  There after TiVo will call a local or 1-800 number to update its listings  and content daily.In my experience TiVo's Customer Care is very good if  your TiVo should develop a problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Live the future of TV now, get a TiVo!", "unixReviewTime": 958608000, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2000"}
