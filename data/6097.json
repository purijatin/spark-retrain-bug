When I got it, I carefully read the instructions, finding out that you couldn't use it with a digital PBX phone system, but analog would be fine. When I hooked it  up, it didn't connect. I called customer support MULTIPLE TIMES, but they  never returned my call when they promised. At one time, I was on hold for  45 min. One representitive told me to send it back to amazon.com, when the  unit WAS NOT DEFECTIVE. I had to buy another one, when it had the exact  same problem, for a grand total of 2 TiVos. Another rep said to go to Radio  Shack and buy a wireless phone jack, which didn't work either. They cost me  more than they are worth. I ended up sending the other one back too. The  unit is really well designed, but if I were going to buy one, I would wait  until there are more competitiors. It's still to early to buy one.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "TiVo customer service - what a joke", "unixReviewTime": 949276800, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2000"}
