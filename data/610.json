All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.  I brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them. The Nook HD will read certain books allowed. My two units ended up being defective and kept crashing. Was able to return both with no problems.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for nook readers and apps", "unixReviewTime": 1386028800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2013"}
