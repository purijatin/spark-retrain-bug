Bridges", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewtext": "Ok, so it sounds like a digital VCR with a few bells and whistles, and very limited capacity.But that true random access with the ability to switch around has drasticly changed the way I watch TV.Even before TiVo  I tended to tape almost everything I watched. But with TiVo this has become  so painless that I find myself almost NEVER watching live TV. It's so nice  to bounce around between the things I told TiVo to record and the things it  thinks I'd like to watch. I can watch a piece of this, a bit of that. Skip  part of this, delete that show I didn't really want to watch.Plus with  about 10 days schedule into the future, I won't miss anything when out of  town for a week.Only serious flaws are the handling of conflicting  season passes and the limited storage (10 hours on medium quality). I  expect the software problems to be handled in a free upgrade in the next  few months, and the storage to be upgradable in the field at selected  stores.I already find it a pain to watch TV without TiVo.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Changed the way I watch TV, revolutionary", "unixReviewTime": 945129600, "reviewTime": "12 14, 1999"}
