I highly recommend them over VCR's for all the reasons you read in all the reviews.  They also work quite well with few glitches, so I hadn't had much chance to test their tech support, until recently.My Tivo unit is not properly contacting the server to download the program directory.  This has been going on for over 2 weeks, so now my unit won't record at all.  Tivo support lines have 30 min+ waits to get through. Online support is very limited.  Upon getting thru to the first Tivo number, finally, they sent me to a second Philips number, and they were closed, with limited business hours.  It would be one thing if this were just bad out-of-warranty hardware support, we're all used to that.  However, Tivo is charging $12/month for the directory service and to not be willing to even take my call on it is frustrating.I've had no problems with 2 Replay TV units, which I've owned longer, and would recommend them over Tivo.  Functionally, the units are essentially the same -- Tivo's slightly easier to use but Replay is slightly more flexible.  My next unit will be another Replay.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Service Difficulties lead me to recommend Replay over Tivo.", "unixReviewTime": 1065916800, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2003"}
