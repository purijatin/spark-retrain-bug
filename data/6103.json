Now, I can't imagine watching TV without it!  It's so much better than a VCR.  There are so many things I loke about Tivo:1.  You can start watching a program at the beginning even if Tivo's still recording it.2.  The season pass --  select a program once and it records it every time it's on the choosen  channel.3.  The ability to combine my local channels and the satellite  dish channels and see a program guide for all of them.4.  Now Showing --  it's great choosing from a list of recorded programs instead of trying to  find the spot on the tape where a program begins.5.  If you're watching  something that you haven't asked Tivo to record, it still records the most  recent 30 minutes.  So, if you get distracted, you can pick up where you  left off.6.  The ability to record based on lots of selection criteria  (show name, channel, time, etc.)Someone else wrote that you can't go  back to the previous channel.  But, the &quot;enter&quot; button will take  you back.Tivo's the best purchase I've made in a long time, and I highly  recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love My Tivo!", "unixReviewTime": 953596800, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2000"}
