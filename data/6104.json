I only watch 2-3 shows a week, if that.  Tivo lets me record these reliably, watch them in a very easy manner, and sadly has sucked me into watching even more  TV.There are some merits to both Tivo and ReplayTV.  But I will say  that for anyone who is not technical, Tivo is a hands-down winner.  Very  clean and easy interface.  And, techincal thought I am, I prefer Tivo as  well.  My friends with ReplayTV agree that their relatives will prefer  Tivo.I wish Amazom had the 30-hour unit for sale, and I am sure they  will, but I have to buy a Christmas gift and can't wait.  Amazon is listed  as a 30-hour unit seller by the Tivo website, but Amazon customer support  doesn't know when it will become available.Tivo has promised an  upgrade plan for 14-hour units but the plan is not in place and has no  pricing yet.  They should correct this, it has been the one sore point in  an otherwise exemplary pre and post-sales support ssytem.  I am sure it is  due to the rush to get 30-hour units into the hands of new customers during  the holiday rush.Philips has done a great job listening to customers.  I  think they will continue to improve this unit, most of which can be done  with software downloads in the middle of the night.  Support is very good,  and the system works well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tivo is great!", "unixReviewTime": 944006400, "reviewTime": "12 1, 1999"}
