It takes only 5 minutes to make all the necessary connections. It does require a 1-2 hour set up, which is mostly an automatic download of  the channel line up and programming data.TiVo will completely change the  way you watch TV.  It really does learn your likes and dislikes and it will  automatically suggest and record shows and movies that it thinks you will  enjoy. Its really uncanny how it DOES pick shows and movies I enjoy.  You'll probably end up never flipping channels looking for something to  watch or watch &quot;live TV&quot; ever again.  Just make sure you go for  the 30 hour model as the 15 will fill up very quickly.TiVo has been the  best first generation product I have ever owned. Don't be afraid to take  the leap into Personal TV as it is really very easy to use and the  recording quality is MUCH better than with VCRs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Forget TV without TiVo", "unixReviewTime": 955238400, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2000"}
