This  is a simple to use product. Perfect for someone who likes the VCR but hates  buying and storing all those tapes.The user interface is easy to grasp.It is a little on the expensive side -- but my free time is valuable too  - and this product gives me so much time back.You won't be unhappy that  you bought this.Wayne Schulz", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "YOU control your tv viewing schedule.", "unixReviewTime": 945388800, "reviewTime": "12 17, 1999"}
