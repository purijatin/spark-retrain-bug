The 100BaseTX feature was a significant improvement for home networking speed. We have three computers on it, one an always on FTP server and this device handles the traffic flawlessly.If you're using Internet Connection Sharing with computers with mixed NICs (some 10BaseT, some 100BaseT) you might see very minor improvements in internet speed on the computers with 10/100 cards, but don't expect this to increase your cable internet speed dramatically.  Most of the cable networks are 10BaseT and only an upgrade to 100BaseT on their part would make a big difference. So when they say you'll speed up your internet connection, don't believe it!We tried a more expensive one a few months ago that promised improved performance  - thought it might be better at handling traffic and collisions - but it made no difference.  Stick with cheap and reliable, and this one fits the bill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1001289600, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2001"}
