We often have visiting production companies in and out, constantly moving and adding PC's and network printers. There is only one jack in each office, so these little hubs come in handy. So far I have had none fail. The only reason I give it four stars is, as the manual states, when you use the uplink port the adjacent port can't be used as they are interconnected. This usually catches people who just come and plug in and then wonder why they can't get on. Other than that, no complaints. A great hub for the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Have 12 of these.", "unixReviewTime": 1131926400, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2005"}
