I completely upgraded my 6 computer 10 Mbps system to 10/100 in about 1/2 an hour. Also, I upgraded in the middle of the day  while the network was running and with little interruption to the  workstations or the network.  The only trouble I had was my own mistake.  I couldn't get two of my computers NIC to run at the faster 100 Mbps speed  only to later find that the hubs had automatically sensed that the NIC's  were 10 mbps only.  They work like a charm and so does my new fast network.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good and simple", "unixReviewTime": 959126400, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2000"}
