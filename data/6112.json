The first involved an SMC router.  The Linksys documention and overall user experience (setup guide, admin screens, and so forth) put the SMC materials to shame-- really it's night and day.  Both routers seem to work fine (though the SMC unit conked out on me; I think this was a fluke.)  But the Linksys' usability wins hands-down.  Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm very impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1025568000, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2002"}
