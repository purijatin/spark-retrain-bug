This hub is perfectly utilitarian for getting the data back and forth with high reliability and unparalleled speed.  No problems auto-sensing in either situations over several months of use.Though it does say 5 ports - if you use this as an uplink from the router, you'll obviously only get 4 output ports.  This is not the case with the gaming issue though.  The only minor complaint is the AC resistor power cable. The AC adapter plug is rather easy to yank out of the backside - especially if you are moving cables frequently. Other than that, it's worth every cent for high speed fun and efficiency!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A totally flexible and reliable splitter", "unixReviewTime": 1007683200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2001"}
