It was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago.  Only port 5 shows activity any longer - ports 1-4 are dead.  I've never had a router fail like this before (and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house).I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys.  That's 26% over the proper voltage (7.5v)!  It's quite possible that over-powering the unit during it's lifetime would have shortened its life.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Random death", "unixReviewTime": 1281657600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2010"}
