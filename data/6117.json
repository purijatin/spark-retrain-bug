It does what it is designed to do, and does it well. There is no configuration, and no set up, just plug and play. I own several of these, and I have never had to touch it after installing it onto my network.There is a basic switch; there is no port filtering, no protocol filtering, and no interference. Some higher end switches come with those features, but in the end they just end up slowing the network down unless they are higher end. Anyone that requires those features should not consider this switch, or any device in this price range. It will just slow your network down, go with an enterprise solution from HP, Cisco or similar.For 99% of the home and small business users looking to buy this, I recommend it highly. IT professionals, or network managers I would look at either a gigabit switch, or something more advanced. On larger networks, with 200+ users, if you install ten of these it will increase latency, and decrease the speed of your network. I am an IT manager and these are great for small singular uses, but do not build or manage your networks with these types of devices. You are asking for trouble down the line.Back to 99% of users, this device is perfect for you. I feel obligated to share my more technical advice for the people in my profession that may purchase this switch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Device", "unixReviewTime": 1223942400, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2008"}
