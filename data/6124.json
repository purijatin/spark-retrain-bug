So the need to extend my WRT-54G's ports out to an effective 7 meant buying a small 4 port from Linksys and to buy it through Amazon.Well, I plugged the puppy in on the same strip as my WRT54G and my Cable \"Modem\" and immediately noticed a low, but irritating, hum coming from the power brick.  I gave it a week or so to ensure that normal house noise would cover the noise... no joy.  If I'm in that room studying I can hear the buzz.I called Linksys Tech Support and they said 1) no known issues existed with the power Supply brick and 2) I was supposed to go to a local electronics store and buy a replacement brick to diagnose the problem!  Nope, that doesn't work for me.My solution - I'm ordering a replacement unit today from Amazon and will return one or both.  While Linksys is now cutting corners like D-Link, I have faith that Amazon won't...  They recently took care of a Kindle issue that was more my fault than theirs.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Plug in and go - but... mine has a noise issue...", "unixReviewTime": 1307750400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2011"}
