I'm a network administrator, but I only have one ethernet port in my office, so I needed a switch (or hub) to allow me to add more than one computer to the network in here.  This thing sits on my desk and have a really small footprint.  It's awesome.  It has all the indicator lights I need/want, and it fast, really fast.  I have always been a fan of Linksys products, and this one is no different.  If need a hub and can spare a few bucks for a switch, they are faster, and this one is great.  And yes, it has an uplink port.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Now this is a great little product.", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
