The devices can all have different duplex/speed settings and they will work fine.This switch is very inexpensive, costing about the same as a simple hub. It was simple to set up, taking less than 10 minutes, and has never given me any problems.Highly Recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works As Expected, Inexpensive Solution!
