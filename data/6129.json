It works, and it's inexpensive.  As more and more network-capable consumer electronic products come out, the greater the need will be for devices like these.I am currently using this product to share a single network jack between a Windows PC and a MacIntosh Pro.  Speed is much more than sufficient.  Your internet connection speed will be the bottleneck in most cases, not your home network.One thing to keep in mind though is that not all devices will work if you have this switch between the device and your office network's switch/hub.  I could not get the IP telephone at work to function through this switch.  However, the computers have no trouble under the same conditions.  I confess that I am not knowledgeable when it comes to IP phones though.This is a very handy device.  I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Useful and Inexpensive", "unixReviewTime": 1229040000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2008"}
