Saw these at Barnes and Noble and picked some up for the kids. The difference between the HD and the table is night and day. The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too. GREAT!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Value", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}
