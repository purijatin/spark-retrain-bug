The unit doesn't seem to allow the sharing of a single IP address and that's all my Roadrunner ISP allows for each account. So, if you're in SoCal and are with Roadrunner, I suggest you get a router. Linksys has a decently affordable one--the Linksys BEFSR41 4-Port Etherfast Cable/DSL Router. Check it out. But not to beat this puppy with a shovel, it's not a bad switch. File transfer rates between computers through the switch aren't too bad and it's a cinch to install. Just remember to check all your network settings. Peace out.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A breeze to install but no cable modem access!", "unixReviewTime": 978998400, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2001"}
