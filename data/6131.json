Search online for the difference between a switch and a router to learn more. I wanted to share the internet access from my cable modem with my computer and my new internet capable blu-ray player. Well, I found out the hard way that this switch will not do the trick! If you already have a (wired or wireless) router between your cable modem and your computer then you can use a switch like this to connect more computers. It just gives you more ports but it does not convert IP addresses to the outside world (which is what you need when you want to access the internet from multiple network devices).I bought a router from Best Buy for $40, but you can of course also buy them on Amazon. They are a little bit more expensive then a simple switch.Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know! Otherwise I guess it works just fine!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This does NOT share internet access from a DSL/Cable modem!", "unixReviewTime": 1295654400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2011"}
