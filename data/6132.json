Even though I was happy with it, I bought one of these, primarily because it was cheap and thought having a 'spare' couldn't hurt.I had no idea how much that aging piece of equipment was slowing down my network!  Almost everything I have now is 10/100, so dropping in this switch made my whole network a heck of a lot faster.  Furthermore, as a switch (as opposed to a hub), it is much more efficient with the use of the network - traffic isn't broadcast everywhere, only to the nodes that need it.I am VERY happy with this purchase.  Cheap, fast, and drop-in simple installation to my existing network.  I decided to purchase another as a 'spare' and donate my older hub to history.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Drop it in and see the speed boost", "unixReviewTime": 1125446400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2005"}
