I had a cable running through the attic to another room where I had a computer attached to the network. I needed to add another computer in that room to the single cable and was not sure how best to proceed.After doing some research on the web, which included learning the difference between a hub and a switch; I discovered the switch should do the job I needed done. I plugged the ethernet cable from the router into port one, and a desktop into port 2 and the laptop into port 3. It all connected and worked properly once I had set up the laptop to connect to the network. It is now working perfectly and the switch is invisible to the network, but is quietly doing its job.I am using the Linksys router and switch and they are doing the job I needed done. I am completely satisfied with the product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Installed With No Problem", "unixReviewTime": 1209686400, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2008"}
