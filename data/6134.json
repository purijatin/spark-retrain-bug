This switch gives me extra ports to connect my Slingbox, Ooma, Blu-Ray player, and television to my home network/internet.  Since the device is so simple, there's very little that can go wrong with it.Potential buyers should consider how many devices they want to connect, and then add one or two ports for future devices.  Six months ago, I never would have expected to need one Ethernet port, let alone four, in my family room; with changes in technology, you may need to upgrade to a larger workgroup switch sooner than you expect.  If you are only worried about Blu-Ray and one or two game consoles, then this switch should be adequate both now and in the near future.Products that can be connected to this switch:ooma Core VoIP Phone System with No Monthly Phone Service BillsSling Media Slingbox PRO-HD SB300-100PlayStation 3 80GBSamsung BD-P1500 1080p Blu-ray PlayerSony Bravia W-Series KDL-52W4100 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTVAnd many more.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent way to connect Ethernet devices, but plan for the future", "unixReviewTime": 1230508800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2008"}
