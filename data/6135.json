Korte", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I pulled it out of the box & plugged it into a router port and added my two printers... didn't even have to configure the one printer, easy \"add device\" for the other printer. Switches are tiny now and it was so easy. It's hidden and I don't plan on touching it for years. The specialty router costs $200 and a port went bad. $22 is a lot cheaper. Thank you for extending the ports.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect switch for the job", "unixReviewTime": 1300924800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2011"}
