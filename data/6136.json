Several of those devices do have wireless capabilities, but I felt much better with having them directly connected to the ethernet through the old-fashioned wired way. This is both for security reasons as well as for the sake of reliability the speed of connection. A full additional router for that purpose would be unnecessary and much of an overkill, and this switch seemed like a perfect solution. When I got it I was at first surprised with how small it was - it is hardly larger than a deck of cards. The small size belies its performance, since it worked perfectly and impeccably form the very moment I had it set up. I have been using it for about half a year now, and have not had any performance or other issues with it. Its small size is a bonus since it doesn't add to the electronic clutter at home. The front lights give you an indication of the working status of several network features. Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with it and for the price there is probably no better switch on the market right now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for your home or home office network", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"}
