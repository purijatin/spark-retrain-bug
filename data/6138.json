I purchased this product and it didn't work, sent it back to Amazon to get replaced.  Then it still didn't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasn't, and that this is the 2nd 'faulty' switch.  However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them.  I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number isn't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product, I hope it works for you.  But if you think you might need some service from the company, you may want to think about going to a competitor (are there any in this price range?).", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Customer Service?
