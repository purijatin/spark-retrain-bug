At first I wasn't all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store, but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps, including Google Playstore. It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets. It is great to read with, but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics, I can't think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome tablet!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1371427200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2013"}
