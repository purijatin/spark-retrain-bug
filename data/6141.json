Reavie \"lakotazz\"", "helpful": [11, 12], "reviewtext": "I had been using a Linksys router for a few years before buying this switch.  Then I changed to a new DSL provider (Frontiernet) whose modem is also a router, so I picked up this switch to split my connection to various computers in my home (having two routers on Frontiernet caused problems with TCP port forwarding).  First, I was surprised by the compact size of the switch.  I hooked it up and it was good to go - a slick connection and no messing around.  It is a perfect companion to the Speedstream 5200 DSL modem, and probably many others.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect little unit", "unixReviewTime": 1083974400, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2004"}
