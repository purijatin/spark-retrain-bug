So, I got this and as described above I set it up and it works flawlessly.  Both connected right away to the internet and I can have both connected and downloading stuff at the same time should I want.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheap, small, easy to set up, and it does what it needs to.", "unixReviewTime": 1170288000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2007"}
