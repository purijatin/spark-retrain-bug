In fact the computer this is being typed on is hooked up to it. My setup: 50MB cable internet via a Motorola Surfboard fed to a router. That feeds a cable threaded through my basement to an old Netgear switch that died, hence the need for this new EZXS55W ver. 4.2 switch. At that point my network splits and feeds the OLD version of this switch and then to this computer.Until I bought this new EZXS55W switch, I was getting more than my promised 50mb download speeds all over my house. No issues at all. The internal network transfers were only slowed down by how fast the hard drives of various machines are. Then my old Netgear switch died, so I picked up this EZXS55W switch. Everything slowed to a crawl. Max downloads of 1.5mb per second. Streaming Netflix/Amazon Prime videos to my Sharp connected TV takes ages to load and it's always low quality. Network transfers are brutal. Took me a few days to realize what it was. SO I went out and bought another brand of switch, swapped it for the EZXS55W, and miracle of miracles, all my speeds went right back to normal.Again, my EZXS55W  says ver. 4.2 on it, I don't know if that's relevant. What I do know is this thing is a piece of junk. Avoid.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worthless", "unixReviewTime": 1314230400, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2011"}
