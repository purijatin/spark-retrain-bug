Ethernet cable goes in and five more come out.  The AC plug is not a huge strip hoging brick.  It took zero configuration to get it to work perfectly.I have a long ethernet cable that runs from the cable modem/router in the atic to my computer in my den.  I plug that cable into this switch and then two cables come out to my computer and printer.  Now everything is networked with my wireless devices.  It is exactly what I wanted.  I might even get a networked hard drive now that I have the switch in my den.The price on Amazon is really good too.  I was going to buy this used on ebay, but found it here for just a few bucks more brand new.It has been running for a few weeks and I have not had any problems with it whatsoever.A+ product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works perfectly - even for the technophobic", "unixReviewTime": 1253577600, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2009"}
