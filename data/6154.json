The older switch is over a year old and has held up wonderfully with moves, a few drops on the floor, and signal drops from the cable modem in front of everything. No issues, great product and I would definitely recommend, all at a great low price too!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Linksys 5-Port Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1220572800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2008"}
