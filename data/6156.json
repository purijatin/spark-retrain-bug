One warning note though: if you connect the switch to the internet through a router you only have 4 usable ports, not 5. One of the 5 will be empty but not usable. Not a problem for me and I put some tape over the unusable port to avoid confusion. (It's the one next to your ethernet connection.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Exactly what I needed", "unixReviewTime": 1287792000, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2010"}
