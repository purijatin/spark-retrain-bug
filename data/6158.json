Since I had a DSL Modem with a firewall, I didn't need another router and this product allowed me to connect 5 computers to the switch.  Installation took about 5 minutes and I noticed an increase in speed right away.  I recommend this product to someone that doesn't need a firewall.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast and Easy to Install", "unixReviewTime": 1194307200, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2007"}
