I would be very cautious about swallowing a few of the &#34;most helpful favorable reviews&#34;.  Pay attention to that quoted phrase.  I strongly suspect many are paid reviewers or actually employees or someone connected with the addons for the Nook.  Just a &#34;heads up&#34;.  Amazon loves to put the &#34;favorable&#34; insiders up front because the bottom line is sales and what leaves your wallet into theirs is the driver.My Nook is okay for the $79 at my local computer store that wanted to get rid of them.  Its not a bargain at the prices we see here.  If you're serious about a tablet then save up for a good one if you can.  If not, it should work for you.Most folks are putting out honest reviews, some whine artists, some scammers, some who just need to talk to someone.  We can't do much about that, but we can comb through and pick out what we might be able to trust.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just an honest review", "unixReviewTime": 1386288000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2013"}
