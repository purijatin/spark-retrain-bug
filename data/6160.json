All I wanted was my Tivo box to connect to my computer upstairs via a network cable, with an extra port provided by the switch downstairs for a computer to act as a media center to control stored tv programs and movies. I briefly read the manual online (to see which outlet was the upstream outlet), plugged in the cables, and the box worked without any need to reboot the Tivo, or alter any setting on the modem, router, or switch.Network has been stable since setting it up, and problem free.Network is comprised of Linksys/Cisco broadband router, a Linksys/Cisco wireless hub which is connected to the switch via a cable since the wireless link would not stay stable to permit a whole program to transfer via Tivo Desktop.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Switch Does The Job", "unixReviewTime": 1255219200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2009"}
