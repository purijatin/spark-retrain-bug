There is no software driver required for this (drivers are required and supplied with the NIC cards that go in your machine). Looks really cute sitting on the shelf with the blinking LEDs!  Hope to use it when eventually get DSL or cable internet access out here.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for home networks", "unixReviewTime": 971308800, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2000"}
