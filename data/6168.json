Now the internet connection got very slow or I get error message; \" No Connection\".Since this product does not have a reset switch, I tried to power circuit this, router and cable modem. None helped. Our wireless router is Linksys's WRT54G. This one has been working without a issue since we purchase it in 2005. I tried to upgrade a router to Linksys-Cisco's newer N product last year but found out WRT54G worked more stable, so I had to return a newer one. I trusted Linksys more in the past. I do not think their quality and reliability are not good any more. Very sad.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Died after 2 years", "unixReviewTime": 1338163200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2012"}
