It's small, uses little power, and does what it's supposed to do transparently.  It also stacks (using optional stacking bracket) with my linksys wireless bridge and router and cell phone router.  With this setup, I can get wireless at campgrounds when available, and easily switch to the cell phone network when it's not.Dish Network works seamlessly with this system, so I can order PPV without a phone line. My son's Xbox360 can reach Xbox live.  This switch is the \"heart\" of my RV Network.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "RV Network", "unixReviewTime": 1227916800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2008"}
