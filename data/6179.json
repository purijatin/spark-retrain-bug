My beef is with the EXTREME cost of support,  3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!!  I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events.  I have had my Linksys router for 3 years.  I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address. You will need tech support now and again when you change ISPs, go elsewhere.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Watch Out for Tech Support Costs!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1199491200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2008"}
