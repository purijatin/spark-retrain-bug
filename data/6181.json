I have experienced no problems with this switch, and I am certainly glad that I got this because I have a computer on 10Mb (instead of 100Mb), and I would not want that one computer to slow all the others down. It seems a little overpriced for what it does, but as a product, its performance has been optimal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Fine Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1079913600, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2004"}
