Vetter", "helpful": [6, 8], "reviewtext": "I purchased this switch like most folks to allow an existing Linksys cable modem/router to provide an Internet signal to an additional Ethernet port in my house. In the meantime, I recently bought a Sony Blu-Ray player with Internet video streaming, but I found that the existing Linksys modem/router could not handle the upgraded high-speed service. So I bought a new Motorola DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem. I naively thought I could simply use this Linksys switch to send the signal along its merry way throughout my house. WRONG. After several hours of reseting the IP address on each computer, and several calls to Charter (my ISP), I called Motorola. The Motorola SurfBoard modem is a throughput device, that assigns only one IP and the Linksys switch is not a smart/managed type that can assign individual IP addresses. So I have a new router on its way from Amazon, which should solve the problem, once I place the router immediately after the modem but before the switch! The router will then assign an unique IP address to my four computers and Blu-Ray player. Perhaps this is common knowledge, but the technical support staff at Charter were not aware of this. So just an FYI.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Be Sure Placed in Right Order", "unixReviewTime": 1261958400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2009"}
