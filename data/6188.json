The one I received is all black, and there is another listing for it on Amazon.I don't get the negatives I've read here. Someone said it gets hot. Well, where are you keeping it? It's a simple little digital switch that doesn't create any heat...maybe a slight watmth.Another said something about it being cheap, plastic junk. It's actually a very good quality piece of equipment at a very good price. I guess if it's not a huge, heavy, expensive thing they perceive it as being cheap.There was also a complaint about cutomer service. I'll admit I have not had to call Linksys cutomer service for years, but the 2 or 3 times I have, they are the best. Imagine, actually getting a human person on the phone and walking you through everything you need.Bottom line: Qulity product. Good price. I wish I needed more of these little things...there almost fun to buy and plug all your gadgets in.And oh yeah, very easy and simple \"plug and play\" installation.Ok. For those that insist that nothing is perfect, my only design change would be  to eliminate some of the indicator lighting on the front. There are about 15 little lights on there. My \"office\" area already looked like Christmas at night with all of the LEDs shining off of everything from my computer to the phone to the clock and everything else. Now there are many more colorful lights.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1268352000, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2010"}
