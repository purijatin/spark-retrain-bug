Makiling", "helpful": [287, 292], "reviewtext": "This switch does exactly what it's designed for, sharing an Ethernet connnection. Don't expect to be able to configure VLANs, multilayer switching, VLAN trunks, load balancing, etc. This does not have any routing, NAT, or firewall capabilities. You would use this switch when you already have a router between your internal network and the Internet, and you need additional Ethernet ports. This gives you a full duplex Ethernet connection at wired speed, and it delivers! Perfect for the home office/LAN or for technicians needing extra Etherenet ports for their workbench, as this is what I use mine for. Thanks for reading! Hope this helps!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Little Switch - Does What it's Designed For!", "unixReviewTime": 1087430400, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2004"}
