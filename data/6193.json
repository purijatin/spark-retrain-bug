I had been using 4 port netgear wireless router to hook up everything and had already ran a wire to the basement of my house for the Xbox 360. When I added another computer in the basement I needed to be able to run an ethernet cable to it but didn't want to run another cable to the basement. I bought this and hooked up the computer and the 360. I can use both at the same time and it doesn't effect the rest of my network upstairs. I still can connect the 360 as a media center extender and stream music from any of my connected computers. In summary this switch works exactly like I expected.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works.", "unixReviewTime": 1230249600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2008"}
