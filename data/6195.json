Linksys sells a pack of very versatile plastic mounting plates that not only allows you to mount components vertically on the wall or you can stack them.  When stacking the compact to the standard, you will notice the form has places for the feet of either series on each side so you can mix and match as you see fit.  The box comes with a load of these, more than I can't imagine anyone including your \"netties\", finding a use for ALL of them, but the small expense offsets any concern about leftovers!The Linksys description and part number for a box of these are \"Wall Mount and Stacking Bracket\" mo. no. SM01, the color could be described as deep grey or charcoal:  Very handy, very cheap, either tough polymer or plastic, and very simple.As for the Linksys switch above I have two and both installed easily and operate trouble free.  This switch compares favorably with slightly less expensive D-Link's Desktop Switch.  I'm no expert but I don't see much difference between the two with the execption of D-Link's missing \"uplink\" port tied into the eigth port.  Both are plug and play.Now back to my own network madness,(Q^(Q^(Q$Q!!*  AX~", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Size differences between \"compact\" and \"standard\" Linksys components", "unixReviewTime": 1254009600, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2009"}
