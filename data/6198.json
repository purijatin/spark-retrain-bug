I'll be surprised if this one lasts a year.  I definintely got a bad one, but it's so inexpensive, it's not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either Linksys or the marketplace seller.  This should be a fool-proof device, and probably is if you get a good unit.  Mine, on the other hand, thinks there is always something connected to port 4, bringing down the entire network.  Actually connecting something to port 4 solved that problem, but I'm still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about 25% that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct.  If you're looking for an inexpensive switch, I might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one, keep another good one as a backup, and return the remainder.  Otherwise spend the extra money for a switch made by a company with actual quality control.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "What Quality Control?", "unixReviewTime": 1256428800, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2009"}
