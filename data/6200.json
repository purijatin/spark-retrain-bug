It works fine until it dies (but that's like saying a stapler staples correctly: it's supposed to).Just to note: I run them in a very friendly environment -- no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem.  (Also, you can count me as an \"expert user\".)I myself will never buy another Linksys product again -- I'll try out Netgear & DLink and other brands, but goodbye Cisco/Linksys.  If you chooose to try their products, caveat emptor.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "works well while it lasts -- but don't count on long life", "unixReviewTime": 1093824000, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2004"}
