I have never had a problem w/ any of my Linksys switches; however, this one was another story. At times my printers would see it and at times they would not. I have 4 computers networked and at times they could see it and other times not. An undefined network showed up in my Network and Sharing Center as if the switch was acting like another entire network (which I did not have access to). I finally gave up trying to make it work and bought a TRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Desktop Metal Housing Switch, TEG-S80g. I plugged it in, the mysterious network disappeared and everything worked perfectly right out of the box: my magic jack, computers, printers, scanner, two TV's and two blue-ray players.
