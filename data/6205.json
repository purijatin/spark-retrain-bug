It's small enough to set on top of a computer case and provides eight ports of full duplex, 10/100 networking.It has a very informative display to give out info for connection speed, duplex connection and collision. The setup is as simple as plugging in the power and network cables. I have yet to run into any problems with this unit and would recommend it without a second thought.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You can't go wrong with this", "unixReviewTime": 971395200, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2000"}
