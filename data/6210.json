The speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem.  The only thing worth noting is that the device I received is colored different.  Instead of being blue and black the one I received was all black.  As I said, this made no material difference, the device has worked properly for over 2 years now.  Very satisfied.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Pleased With This Workgroup Switch...", "unixReviewTime": 1336262400, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2012"}
