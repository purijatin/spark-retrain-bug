It is cascaded off my 4 port router when my network expanded. Works flawlessly. You just plug into your network and your up and running. My network consists of a Netgear router feeding this switch which in turn feeds a wireless access point. My only complaint is that I should have bought the 16 port unit as this one is full.Network novices should remember that an 8 port switch is really only a 7 port switch as the 8th port is shared with the WAN uplink. At least this switch has the separate uplink port.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect. As easy as an extension cord.", "unixReviewTime": 1043971200, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2003"}
