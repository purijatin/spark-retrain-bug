Plugged the switch into the router then into the wall and it was done. Very easy, no setups, no firmwares, simple. One thing you should be aware of (I'm not going to rate the products itself less because of this) is that the next generation models are out. It's the same thing but they are considerably smaller than the previous version. Amazon should really update there picture. I have this stacked on top of my Linksys wireless router and it does fit but it does not lay in the four corners and previous linksys products. Not a big deal and still looks fine but just a heads up. 5 Stars", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Plug N Play - No Setup Required", "unixReviewTime": 1251936000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2009"}
