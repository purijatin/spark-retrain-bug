It was shipped to me rather quickly and when I opened the box it was a total different product. Now I don't mean different product as in it wasn't a linksys. It was in fact a linksys but it wasn't blue and black like I thought it was and models I've seen in the past. It in fact was an all black model. To be honest I was really glad about that because most of my networking products (Other Linksys Devices) are all black.I run my Xbox through this along with a wireless access point which is a linksys as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1371168000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2013"}
