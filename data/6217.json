Recently, it started acting up and finally gave out completely.I bought this 10/100 because it was cheap. I was a bit worried because it wasn't gigabit but it works fine. A network expert would probably tell me that a gigabit switch was surplus to requirements for home use. A 10/100 that works is infinitely better than a 10/100/1000 that doesn't work.I use this for streaming - Roku 2 XS, WD-TV, Sonos, Hopper. Actually, the Hopper is sort of a reverse streaming thing. It has a Slingbox on it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works perfectly", "unixReviewTime": 1357516800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2013"}
