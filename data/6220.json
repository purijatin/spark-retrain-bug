Lane \"Sideshow Bob\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The form factor was not exactly as shown in the picture with the large Linksys stackable legs, which would have been nice as I have all Linksys stackable routers and WAPs. Rather it is the exact same unit without the large stackable legs. I can still stack it, and the smaller legs do interlock with other like units, which I have also.I prefer to stack components rather then have them sit side by side all over the place, and a lot of the new form factors are stand alone, facing up, or standing on their side, made to be the ONLY all-in-one componet for the average home user. If your network is more extensive with several waps and switches along with your router stacking saves space and just looks better.But either way for $29 it was a great deal! I have found Linksys products to be very reliable. I have a router, two WAPs and two switches, all Linksys products that all work great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good deal for $29", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}
