Now a TV, AV/Receiver, Media Player, BRD player, game console all need connections, that is 5. I did not go with a Gigabit router, since streaming and even gaming in general does not require that much bandwidth.The only problem I had was around connect the cat5 cable. I am not a network specialist, and frankly it took me forever to figure out that the &#34;uplink&#34; should not be used in this setting. So use port 1-8, and steer away from the  Uplink part. That is apparently needed for your router, but not for extending the wired network.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for entertainment system", "unixReviewTime": 1387843200, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2013"}
