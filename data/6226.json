The first one served well for around ten years, and was a casualty in a recent move. When I needed more wired connections I looked around, but these are still the best for the sub-$100 price range.Cisco recently sold Linksys to Belkin, which concerns me. I figured it would take some time for the manufacturing to go downhill (I despise Belkin and have never had a good experience with them), and I was right. This switch does not disappoint.Some people swear by wireless, but you cannot beat the speed and security of a wired connection. I highly recommend this product and, assuming Belkin doesn't taint the product line, would buy another one if my current one got crushed like my last one did.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Old Faithful", "unixReviewTime": 1363392000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2013"}
