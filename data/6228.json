The Power Adapter was dead on arrival.  The Switch OK.  I had an old Adapter for my 5 Port to check it.  30 minutes on the phone and Linksys is sending a new Adapter RMA in 3-5 business days.  Hope it works!  I'll be back if it doesn't.I'm back.  Got the RMA replacement Power Adapter from Linksys in 5 days.  No joy!  Same problem!  I've requested by email a return for exchange or refund to Beach Camera and hope they cover the return postage in either case.  So far I can't blame Beach at all, but Linksys support was less than cooperative the second time I called about the replacement adapter not solving the problem.  The switch itself still will function with my old 5 port power adapter but neither of the new power adapters from Linksys.  I hooked my laptops to it and was up and running on the Internet through the switch with the 5 port power adapter both times.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "DEFECTIVE POWER ADAPTER 9V 0.8A", "unixReviewTime": 1257984000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2009"}
