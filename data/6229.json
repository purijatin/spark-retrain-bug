Just plug it in and go.  I have been using Linksys for years with no problems, and we use all Cisco equipment at the hospital where I work. I only gave 4 stars because the switch in the picture is not what I received.  This switch is smaller and all black.  Really no big deal, but I like to receive what I am looking at.  Otherwise, I would have said 5 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Switch", "unixReviewTime": 1293753600, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2010"}
