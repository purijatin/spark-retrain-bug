When a cable modem was installed this past Saturday, I had no ethernet card, so USB was required. I was very happy with the connection, even though the download speed was falling quite short of the claims made by our local cable provider...but no matter, this was such a vast improvement over 56k that it just didn't seem to matter.One day later I found out about the AT&T; CallVantage service, which allows you to have phone service via a high speed modem. Price was very attractive, but one problem--an ethernet card was required for hookup.  That was the reason for purchasing the LNE100TX.I'm still waiting for the CallVantage equipment, but in the meantime the money spent on this card may be the best money I've ever spent--download speeds increased dramatically once this card was installed, compared to USB! 250-320 KB/Sec speeds were being experienced with the USB connection (on a fairly recent Intel motherboard). They immediately zoomed to 450-520 KB/Sec using the LNE100TX. Repeated tests of the download speed have yielded similar results, so I'm confident that this upsurge can be attributed solely to the LNE100TX.Installation was quick/easy, and the price was right. I'm very pleased, and surfing the internet is fun once more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Money Well Spent", "unixReviewTime": 1107907200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2005"}
