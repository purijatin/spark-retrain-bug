When trouble shooting my network, I decided to return another ethernet card, made by another manufacturer, and see if that was my problem. Since I was using a Linksys Router Cable DSL hub, I thought it could be part of it. NOT, it performed the same. My performance problem turned out to be Norton Internet Security, which was only installed on that machine. Nothing to do with the hardware.All in all, this card is a very nice piece of equipment. It couldn't install any easier. Booted down, with your power plug removed, you install it in an available PCI slot. When rebooting, it asks for the driver, which is located on the included CD. It loads, and your off to the races. No configuring. Just smooth performance.Highly recommended. Linksys has been only good to me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This card is sweet", "unixReviewTime": 1060646400, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2003"}
