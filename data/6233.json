I highly recomend both over those no-name brand things you can get, but neither are the greatest.  I have, however, used Linksys cards (including this one) in many application and I've never had a problem.  Beware that the drivers aren't included in the OS which can be a pain, but of course they include drivers, and their website posts the latest ones.If you can get an Intel or 3com NIC, do it.  If you can't look at this one and the NetGear.  They will work for you.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "These are great... For the price.", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
