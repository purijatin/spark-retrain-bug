The installation couldn't have been easier.  Just plug the card in and install the drivers.  Windows (ME) had no problem recognizing the card on either machine.  Once the cable modem was installed everything worked like a charm.Two words of warning:- The directions are very complete, but don't include specific directions for Windows ME.  I doubt this would trip anybody up and the Windows 98 directions are certainly good enough.- The drivers available on the Linksys website require you to know information that is only available on the card.  If for some reason your box doesn't have a driver disk (one of mine didn't), make sure to download the correct driver set before installing the card.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It doesn't get any easier", "unixReviewTime": 1004918400, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2001"}
