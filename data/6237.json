It took all of two minutes to pop this reliable performer into my WinXP machine.  XP immediately recognized it upon bootup;  I didn't even need to use the driver CD that came with the card.Performance since then has been exactly what I expected with no hiccups.PROS*  True plug-n-play setup*  Hassle-free configuration and solid performance*  Price - under $$$ with the current manufacturer's rebateCONS*  Linksys registration requires the serial number which is only on the card itself - write it down before installation", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "100 Mbps and Really Easy Setup", "unixReviewTime": 1060387200, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2003"}
