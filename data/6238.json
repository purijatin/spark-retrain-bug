I amtechno-savvy, but I still though the text and the supportingcolor pictures were great.The software installation on Window 2000s was a snap. Ididn't even need the support disk.  Windows 2k recognizedthe card, and installed it all for me.I LOVE PLUG-n-PLAY.LinkSys is a reputable company ...LinkSyshas a great website as well.
