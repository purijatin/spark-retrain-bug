I got it for my dad who's finally going DSL.  Installation was a breeze in his Win98 system.  The package already comes with the latest drivers for the various flavors of Win95 and Win98, and if you use WinXP, the OS already has the drive for this card built-in, so it's pure plug-n-play.  Just install the card in a PCI slot, turn on your computer, and maybe install the driver (depending on the OS version), and you are all set.  Compatible with DSL and cable modems.  This is one excellent value.(There's a wire for the \"wake-on-LAN\" feature.  I don't have a LAN, so don't know if it actually works.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredibly cheap and works well", "unixReviewTime": 1052092800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2003"}
