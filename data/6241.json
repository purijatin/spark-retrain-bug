I finally gave up just short of re-compiling the kernal (network card should not be *that* difficult to support). After spending serveral days search the net for updated drivers and newgroup info on the card, I decided it wasn't worth the effort and I put my Intel 21040 chipset card back in (which now works with the latest dist of Mandrake). Windows install was odd, but finally worked after tweeking the BIOS settings.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Quirky Drivers, poor Linux support", "unixReviewTime": 973123200, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2000"}
