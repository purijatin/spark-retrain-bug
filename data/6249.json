It worked great. So I put another one into my wife's Quantum, which runs NT 4. Installation took a little more fiddling, but the card worked flawlessly after I'd found the right driver. It's inexpensive and it does everything we need for home networking.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It just works. What more could you want?", "unixReviewTime": 1131753600, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2005"}
