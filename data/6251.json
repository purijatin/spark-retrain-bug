Then I decided to switch to these linksys cards, and they worked like a charm. Coupled with the linksys 5 port workgroup switch home networking is a breeze.So why did I give it 4 stars? I wanted to use the Wake-On-Lan feature of the card, since my old CNet had it. But when I got the new linksys card, the WOL was only through a feature called PME (Power Management Event), whereas the CNet (and other cards) provide a WOL cable that connects to the motherboard. The linksys card did not provide for this cable.Also, the card is version 5.1 but keeps appearing as version 4 in Windows XP.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great card... ?", "unixReviewTime": 1038441600, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2002"}
