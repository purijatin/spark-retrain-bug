I first got this card because of my new cable internet connection. Even if you are a novice computer user with no experience in computer hardware you can install this card youself! The directions are very good with step by step instructions that are easy to read for anyone. Once you have it installed the driver instructions are also easy to read and offer them for Any operating system you can think of. If you are running windows xp (or thinking of upgrading) you don't even need to install the drivers yourself because they are built into windowsxp and it will install itself making instulation that much easier! They also have a nice webpage that further explains troubleshooting if you get into a problem for some reason! Don't go pay some store 50-100 bucks to install a network card you can do it yourself in 20 mintues for nothing and Linksys makes it possible at a very good price!Also, after having the card installed for over a year it has never gave me any problems whatsoever! I wish i could say that about some other hardware that i have purchased!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Card, Great Price, No Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1010361600, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2002"}
