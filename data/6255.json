This is the Linksys LNE100TX. We have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have ended=up regretting doing so. The price is what initially attracts, but the shabby construction, questionable installation, and high failure rate - not to mention Linksys' horrible customer support.Avoid this one. You're not saving any money buying this card. You're only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the Linksys card.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A really Bad NIC...", "unixReviewTime": 974332800, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2000"}
