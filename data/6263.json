There will be a *second* entry that pops up -- that lists the volume label of the media you have inserted into that drive. Please access it using that-- do not click on the mounted drive entry :)If you click on the volume label only to get an error, this means your disk is bad. Now, a bad disk does not necessarily mean \"totally unaccessible\" just as a bad hard drive does not necessarily mean that, either.Sometimes a zip disk will access under one operating system, but not another -- when it is going bad. It also depends upon the file system you are using. If your zip disk is formatted in the FAT16 / FAT32 Formats -- all OSes should read it fine. If it is in NTFS -- only Microsoft Windows (and unix, linux, etc distros which properly use the NTFS driver) will be able to see it. If it is formatted under Linux and you need to see this in Microsoft Windows -- you will need to Google for and Download a utility called EXT2FS. Be warned -- though they claim it works fine under Vista, it breaks hard under Vista. XP and lower only, please :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Under Linux - For Expert Use Only :)", "unixReviewTime": 1251849600, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2009"}
