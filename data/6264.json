The USB interface worked fine on my desktop (Win 98) BUT the installation also enabled the never-before usable USB port on my laptop (Win 95b).  I  wasn't expecting this.  I was going to buy the optional PCMCIA interface -  but this saves me the forty bucks.  I didn't look at the transfer rate but  it seems even faster than my 100 Mb internal Zip (ATAPI interface) on one  of my 'puters.  Very fast!
