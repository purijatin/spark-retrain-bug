Have not had any system locks, either.  It's much faster than my old Zip 100 that ran on the parallel port, though the 250-USB reads Zip 100 disks with no problem (though slower than 250 disks).  I'm using Iomega's Quik Sync back-up software and it's great to have it operating automatically in the background, without me having to remember to do it.When I bought mine, the USB-powered version was not yet available, so mine uses an AC power adapter.  The USB-powered version would be nice to have for running on my laptop.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast and reliable", "unixReviewTime": 995155200, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2001"}
