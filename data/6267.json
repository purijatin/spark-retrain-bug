It is a little on the slow side for reading and writing of data due to its age, but will work if you have Zip disks that you still need to use. Buy it used.USB flash and CD R/W storage effective killed these products in the marketplace. I had some old files I needed to get access to and a stack of Zip 100 and Zip 250 disks that were the best candidates. A couple of desktops ago I had an internal Zip drive, and had been been lugging that machine around from place to place in case I needed it. Finally I opted to let that machine go to free up space, so recently when I decided to move those files onto newer storage I had to pick up a drive. I was very surprised to see that the price for one of these drives is still well over $100 new in 2014.  The device I bought was a little under $40 new after shipping was added on, for about an hour of two or use. It gets three stars for being adequate, if outdated, technology. Recommend to borrow the drive if you can find a person who has one, or else buy it used.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Oudated Technology.
