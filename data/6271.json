Wetzel", "helpful": [19, 19], "reviewtext": "What is good about this zip drive is that it is very easy to install, and requires basically no configuration, just plug in, and install the software. The one thing I don't like about it is it sometimes freezes up  your computer while you are backing up files. I mean you don't have to  restart the computer or anything, you just can't do anything else for a  couple minutes. Sometimes that can be a pain. All in all though, its still  a good product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for backup", "unixReviewTime": 958694400, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2000"}
