It was a great storage medium at the time and the portability of the drive was very helpful.I then bought a CD-RW two years ago and haven't touched my Zip drive since. The CD-RW drives give you all the storage flexibility of the Zip drives but they store more data (unless you purchase the 2 gig Zip Drive), they're cheaper, and more portable and can work across platforms. I can backup my files on a CD and copy them onto another computer. I can create discs of my MP3 files to play back on this or other computers.In the end, it simply is easier to burn a CD and use it on another computer. For example - some time ago I helped a friend of mine put together a presentation on a medical case he had. With all the digitized pictures and cat scans, the power point and graphic files exceed several megs - too many for a floppy. I could have given him a Zip disk and my Zip drive but he would have had to connect the Drive to his computer, install the software, and then copy the files over. Instead, I burned him a CD with the PowerPoint and all supporting files. He simply placed it into the presentation computer and was using it 30 seconds later. It doesn't get much easier than that.Zip drives are seing the end of their days. I would suggest looking at the Zip CD's and the CD-RW if you're considering purchasing a Zip Drive.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Why when you could get a CD burner for the same amount?", "unixReviewTime": 974592000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2000"}
