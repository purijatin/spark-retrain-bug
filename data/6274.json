Arrggh!Needless to say, I would NEVER recommend a Zip drive and I am planning on forever boycotting Iomega.And, if you happen to run into a Zip drive engineer who designed this turkey, please give him or her a (gentle) dope slap for me.Who at Iomega thought this piece of engineering garbage was suitable for valuable data?(If you are tempted to by a Zip, anyway, search for \"Click of Death\" ...before buying a Zip drive. I wonder how many countless gigabytes of data have been lost?)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "The Iomega drive engineers need a dope-slap", "unixReviewTime": 1023580800, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2002"}
