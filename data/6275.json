They are one of the most unreliable, and most expensive forms of data storage I have ever seen... except for the Jaz drive, which happens to be made by the same company.If you want to store a lot of data for the least amount of money, then go out and buy a CD writer, especially if your media is going to be well traveled! I work for a print company in the electronic pre-press department, and I also have a small web design business, and I cannot tell you how many times I have gotten a zip disk that has gone bad while it was being delivered to me.  I have never had a problem with CDs corrupting, sure I have had some CDs that don't work, but that happened during the writing, not because of the way it was stored, or shipped.Save me, you, and everyone else a huge headache by switching to CD-Rs.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Terrible in every way.", "unixReviewTime": 990403200, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2001"}
