However, one of my two PCs uses a serial mouse and AT keyboard, so I had to get this one (which includes ONE set of adapters) instead, because the &quot;compact&quot; switch only supports PS2 mice and keyboards. Much to my surprise, it uses the same keyboard hotkey as the compact switch (although I never saw that feature advertised ANYWHERE). Because of this, I was able to drop the switch (which really isn't very big at all) behind my desk, out of sight -- I never have to touch it! If there's any degradation to my high-resolution screens, I can't tell.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Couldn't be more satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 971654400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2000"}
