I've gone thru two analog switches (the ones with the tangle of wires inside) and I bought a bunch of  cables.  I originally bought cheap monitor cables but the ghosting was  terrible.My old system worked fine at 1024x768 except occasionally it  would lose the keyboard but the fix was to simply reinsert the keyboard  plug.I recently started working with a much larger monitor (running  1600x1024 under windows, 1600x1200 under Linux)  and my old setup just  couldn't handle the video bandwidth; the ghosting was terrible.  So after  checking out the reviews here I thought I'd give this one a try.Its  great.  There might be a tiny bit of ghosting, but its too hard to say if  its just the monitor itself.  The only problem I've noticed, is that I  can't get the mouse to work well under Linux/X windows.  For some reason  the resolution of the mouse just isn't great so the motion is a bit jerky.  But its a small problem albeit annoying.  The keyboard toggle between PCs  works flawlessly and I've never lost the mouse or keyboard and the video is  always centered (although thats probably a function of the monitor).If  you're using two PCs or a laptop and a PC this product is worth its weight  in gold (its very light, as its sold state not the clunkly switch of old :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent!", "unixReviewTime": 961459200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2000"}
