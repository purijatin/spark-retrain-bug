It syncs FLAWLESSLY with my work Win2K laptop and my home desktop Mac.  Its reliable, the battery life is fantastic, and with 8MB of RAM, I find it MORE THAN ENOUGH for all my games, books and apps!My suggestion, skip the Palm 500 and save yourself $....the Palm Vx is everything the Palm 500 is and maybe even more!  Who needs the Secure expansion slot anyway?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic product...", "unixReviewTime": 990316800, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2001"}
