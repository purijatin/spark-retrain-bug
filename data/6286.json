It works great and all but I just want to have a little machine that I don't even feel it when I carry it around.Now Palm Vx does exactly that. It's slim sexy design is well worth the money. Rechargable internal battery means you don't have to worry about changing batteries every month or so and can feel free to use the backlight. :)As for functions, It's basically the same as all Palm III series. 8 MB of ram, Palm OS 3.5, things like that. You'd probably be using the normal functions like calendar, phone book, notepad, task list more often. for me I use it to read chinese books and have a list of important emails backed up on my palm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Slim sexy design, best electronic you can bring with you.", "unixReviewTime": 985651200, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2001"}
