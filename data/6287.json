Surkan", "helpful": [23, 29], "reviewtext": "I use my Palm V as an address book, calendar and to-do list, with a few digital notes. I also have the Dooney &amp; Bourke Palm V Case and the Palm travel kit.The Palm V is sleek and attractive, but has a few major flaws:1. The on button is not protected from being constantly activated by the case, causing the batteries to drain extremely fast.2. The flimsy cover that it comes with is not sufficient. Everybody that I know that has a palm, bought an additional case. The original case should at least be usable.3. The reset button does not clear memory, forcing me to wait for the batteries to die to clear it. No bulk delete option is provided.4. There is no USB option provided with the basic Palm for synching with USB devices.5. The rechargeable built-in battery is nice if you don't leave your cradle for more than a week, but nasty if you travel.In short, the Palm V has potential, but some simple design flaws and the need to buy a number of add-ons just to make it functional are simply unacceptable at that price tag.For my needs, I'm going to the REX 6000. It is far less expensive, much more portable, and provides both USB and PCMCIA synching out of the box.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Nice look, but missed the details", "unixReviewTime": 981417600, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2001"}
