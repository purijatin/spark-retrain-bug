Really.Prior to my Palm Vx, I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere, all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most. As a result, I often forgot to do things that needed to be done, lost important phone numbers, etc.-you get the idea.My Palm Vx changed everything. Now I keep everything important, from the standard addresses, to do's, notes, and appointments to my accounting info, stock portfolio, and local movie times (thanks to AvantGo.com) all on my Palm Vx, and it's GREAT!A warning to those buying Palm V's, though. It takes time to get used to it! I hated grafiti (the &quot;handwriting&quot; you must use for the Palm to recognize your input) at first, and found the miniscule on-screen keyboard a pain. Additionally, I saw no real point in keeping a to do list and ALL my appointments on the thing. After a month of forcing myself to do so, however, I was hooked! After really taking the time to get familiar with the thing, I use it on the order of twenty times a day--far more than I've used any other device (digital or old-fashioned pen and paper).So, my buying advice: buy one! Palm Vx's are absolutely fantastic, really! They're beautifully designed (you won't feel geeky pulling one out!) and the handiest things in the world. I promise! (Be sure to buy a hard case to keep it nice.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely, Positively, Fantastically GREAT!", "unixReviewTime": 980294400, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2001"}
