Hosek", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I had a mishap with my Palm V during a softball game where the Palm was pretty well destroyed. I was more than a little concerned as I had a date in a couple days and the only place I had the girl's phone number and address was on my Palm (I was lax in doing my daily hotsync).So, with some fear, I put my badly dented palm into the hotsync cradle and pressed the big button on the front. Some whirring and clicking and it still synced. That says a lot for the construction quality of this PDA.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Takes a dinking, keeps on syncing", "unixReviewTime": 1026518400, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2002"}
