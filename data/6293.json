It may not have as many features as the new ones, like a color screen, expansion slot, or Bluetooth compatibility, but it's inexpensive and very reliable. It's run downloaded applications smoothly and with no trouble. It's got plenty of memory (8MB), a rechargeable battery, and is thin and light. It's even better when you add accessories like the Palm Portable Keyboard or the Travel Charger. If you're looking for a basic Palm Pilot for a surprisingly inexpensive price, this is for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great First Palm Pilot", "unixReviewTime": 1038614400, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2002"}
