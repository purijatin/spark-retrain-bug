I am a road warrior, so this is a big plus since it can let me know if I have time to relax a little longer before waiting around at the gate for the plane to permit boarding.Second, it has a great form factor.  For those of you who have never owned a PDA before, the form factor gets important over time.  You may think that it isn't important, but anyone who needs a PDA needs it to be small.  If this wasn't the case, try lugging around a heavy laptop and you will know what I mean.Third, and perhaps the most important reason is that this is compatible with all Palm applications.  I know there are other PDAs that are not Palm but use the Palm OS, such as Handspring, and the Sony CLE, but some apps do not work unless you have a geniune Palm.  For example, Dinkypad doesn't scroll in Handspring, but it does so on an original Palm.Also, when you buy a Palm, you can be sure that the upgrades to the OS that Palm releases will be compatible.The only negative thing I have to say about the Vx is that it doesn't go as fast as the Handspring Platinum or Prism, since they have the newer Motorola processor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great pda", "unixReviewTime": 977356800, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2000"}
