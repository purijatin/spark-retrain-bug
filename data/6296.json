Its incredible!  I picked up the Palm Hardcase (yes yes, I know it isn't all aluminum...but it looks nice and gives it more protection than it would have otherwise).  This palm is a pure head turner compaired to their earlier models.  Small, sleek, and rechargable!  I have owned this Palm for over two years now...not a single problem with the rechargable battery.  I was cautious about this...but I get a nice charge from it, and it lasts for QUITE a long amount of use.Palm software is easy to use and easy to install.  Secondly, the palm obviously runs Palm OS.  To this day, it has never given me any problems.  No crashing or anything WindowsCE related.This unit has a B&amp;W display, and even though many of you probably would rather go with a color one...the pricetag is just too high.  Also, I find the B&amp;W display MUCH easier on the eyes than the glaring/bright color display.The only bad thing that I can think of is the backlit display.  Simply put, it is of no use unless you are in absolute darkness.  This is a flaw that was fixed on the backlighting on the new m100 series and on.So if your considering a palm pilot, look to the Palm Vx!  With 8 megs of storage space, its PLENTY of room for ebooks, GPS systems, or anything you can throw at it.  I'd also recommend getting the Write-rights for this palm...keeps it staying like new and reduces any glare you may get off of the screen in bright/glaring locations!  I fully recommend this product to students and professionals alike!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another Incredible Product", "unixReviewTime": 1007769600, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2001"}
