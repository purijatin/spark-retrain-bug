Compared to my old way of keeping track of all my appointments and contacts it is a Godsend.  It was  easy to install the software and the hardware, taking no longer that 10  minutes.  As for the Palm handheld itself it is very easy to use.  If care  to spend about  hour playing with it you don't even need the manual its  all very straightforward.  The HotSync worked great with my Microsoft  Outlook.  Another feature of the Vx is the rechargeable battery.  Although  this can be a great convenience, it can also be a hindrance.  If you're  traveling you have to take a charger.  This is the only shortfall that I  see from this product.  Furthermore I would highly recommend this to  anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An amazing product that will save a lot of time.", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
