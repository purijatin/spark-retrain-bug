I thought of buying the M500 but decided not to due to the cost and not currently being supported by Omnisky Wireless. I like the M500's screen better than the Palm Vx but not enough to justify the extra $100. As of now I didn't see any need for the expansion slots but I'm sure over time there will be a number of usefull extras that come on the expansion cards.Overall I'm pleased with the Palm Vx and would recommend it to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Palm Vx is great", "unixReviewTime": 992995200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2001"}
