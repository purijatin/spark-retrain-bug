I have been truly blessed, this Nook tablet is the best. I am watching movies on it via Hulu and Netflix and other apps for movies etc. The video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors.I do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there, this tablet is sufficient to my needs. There is no camera, if you need one get another type of tablet. I recommend for those who do not need a super tablet, however, this tablet can do a lot. I just have not tried it all yet. I will  again say this, the video playback to me is awesome,it is truly HD. I am very satisfied with my refurbished Nook HD+, II am getting a lot for very little. I recommend buying thNook for a few dollars worth a  lot of fun.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This was such a good buy", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}
