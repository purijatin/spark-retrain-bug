Small footprint, great connectivity to the PC and to mail programs like Outlook. Many, many applications written for it, some shareware, some you can purchase. Easy synchronization via the cradle interface, which is also the recharging unit.Here are the pros:Small, lightweight, fits in a shirt pocket. Standard OS that is widely used. LOOOOOOOONG battery life. Plenty of memory for most text-based application. (8MB) Plenty of peripherals like a sexy little keyboard, a combo ballpoint pen-stylus, travel adapter kits,  car battery charger, IR exchange which works quite well.Cons: It's fragile. Even in the brushed steel folding case I bought, the screen broke when it slipped from my hand. It's Palm OS, which means it doesn't have the advantages of the Pocket PC (former Windows CE) OS to run PowerPoint, (there is a new program for the Pocket PC that lets you view and hear PowerPoint.) It doesn't have color display. The screen font could be clearer (there are better ones on other PDA's) The telephone and wireless stuff isn't in it (that's either the Palm VII with built-in wireless or other brands.) No MP3 player, no voice recorder. And the battery pack is not removable, although it lasts plenty long.Should you buy it? If you want an organizer and email reader, this is excellent. It's what I use every day. The long battery life is a real boon to the traveler. It packs a lot for the money. The optional accessories are priced too high, but this is a complaint against the industry in general. You buy the basic unit, but to add some useful doo-dads, you can rack a significant percentage of the purchase price in no time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The standard that set the standards for handheld PDA's", "unixReviewTime": 986601600, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2001"}
