I switched to the Palm Vx because my Palm III gave out after months of abuse riding in my back pocket.  The Vx is solidly built, very reliable and never needs batteries.  I use mine heavily and sometimes forget to recharge it in the cradle.  I've found that the battery lasts about three weeks with heavy use as long as you don't use the backlight.  I now use my Palm Vx with my laptop running Windows 2000 and synchronize my data using the infrared port.  The cradle is just a charge stand for me!  If you're nervous about buying this product... relax!  I teach computer skills to executives in the Chicago area.  The learning curve for Palm devices is about 20 minutes.  There is a shorthand called &quot;graffiti&quot; that you will need to learn to write in your information, but you can also use your computer or a separately available keyboard to enter in your data.  Newer and more powerful palm devices have been introduced since I bought mine, but the Vx is an excellent value now that the price has dropped.  And it's still the smallest!  If you're looking for a PDA to handle your personal and business information and do not need to display color photos, videos or play MP3s, the Palm Vx is perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You won't understand how you lived without one!", "unixReviewTime": 995414400, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2001"}
