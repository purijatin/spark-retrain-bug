Schwartz", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "With less and less time to remember dates, times, and special occasions, the Palm Vx is a handy gadget. Has a whopping 8 MB of memory, which should be sufficient even with a ton of games ;) Forgetting names, numbers, and addresses will be a fad of the past. There are tons of applications on the internet that you can download and use, which help save time and make this already handy tool even more useful. You can also 'beam' files and your business card to other PDA users as well as laptop users via the Fast Infared Port which allows for wireless transfers. Great buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Electronic Assistant!", "unixReviewTime": 989193600, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2001"}
