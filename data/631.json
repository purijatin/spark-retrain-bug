It seemed like the best value at the time for a 32GB tablet.I thought that it would be good for our trip to Spain.  We ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it.Fast forward a few months of neglecting using the Nook and the device will not even turn on.  I keep thinking that I am doing something wrong, but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to BestBuy after I confirm that I ordered the extended warranty (it's been a busy time for us!).So needless to say I am not impressed....UPDATE:Well, the Nook decided to Power on again when I followed the instructions to turn on a \"dead Nook\".  I don't have the instructions right here, but if you find them (has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time), make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your Nook to factory settings - and you won't want to do that if you have anything stored on it.I will just have to see how it goes.Wish Amazon Instant Video would play on it, but RedBox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for 4 dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming.That along with NetFlix give me two options for streaming video.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dead in the water!", "unixReviewTime": 1388016000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2013"}
