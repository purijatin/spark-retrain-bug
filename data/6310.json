I'm a part-time working mom and I've  got a zillion things to keep track of. The appointment book is great, I can  set alarms for myself and make sure I don't forget the kids piano lesson or  that meeting with the school board. The address book keeps track of  everyone I need to, and organizes them into various categories that I can  define (Personal, Business, PTA Volunteers, whatever.) There is simply a  TON of shareware that can be downloaded, from games for the kids to  professional productivity apps, from spreadsheets to flat file databases,  from medical billing codes to exercise schedule trackers. Anything you can  think of is most likely available.The part I like the best is not only  can I synch the Palm with my own laptop (including email and news websites)  but I can also beam things back and forth with my husband. That way he  knows where I'm going to be and I know where he's going to be. No more  scribbled notes on the kitchen calendar for us! And the Palm Desktop  software can have multi-users so we can even synch to each other's computer  if we like, rather than beaming individual items.All in all this little  piece of hardware is one of the best purchases I've made in years. The only  thing it needs is a case to hold a business card or two, but those are  available all over for purchase from third parties. If you've been thinking  of getting one of these, don't hesitate, go for it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get one and organize your life!", "unixReviewTime": 969062400, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2000"}
