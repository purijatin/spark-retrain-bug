However, the feature I most like is the standard Palm applications, which do a few tasks well, and the wealth of third-party applications that can be easily downloaded.  Compared to the Pocket PCs I own this and the size combine to make the Vx my favorite.  Although this is the only PDA I own that has a monochrome screen the Vx is easier to read in all light conditions.Why choose a Vx?  By any standard this model is obsolete, but is probably the best designed PDA on the market - especially if you want a Palm-powered PDA instead of the more complicated Pocket PC devices - because used ones are attractively priced and it makes an ideal entry-level PDA.  It also may be the only PDA for many people because it is rich with functionality (appointments, calendar, phone list, etc.), and remains compatible with tens of thousands of readily available programs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Classic!", "unixReviewTime": 1039219200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2002"}
