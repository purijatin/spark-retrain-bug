I began my whole Palm expedition several years ago with a Palm Professional (yes, back in the day).  That worked out just fine for the time, but being a gadget junkie, I had to get the Palm V when it came out.  And can I say how much better it was?!?  Not only did you not have to deal with batteries, but you didn't have the bulk that the Palm Pro had.  A few other cool things - the cradle that has a place for your stylus.  This may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it. And I never had any problems with the software. So, as it was I was completely happy with my little, stylish Palm V.Then Handspring came out.  And I had to have that - for the MP3 player.  So I got rid of the Palm and got on the waiting list for a little iMac colored Handspring.  I was super excited - more memory and the cool Springboard feature seemed like it would be nice.  What a disappointment I was in for after having owned the Palm V.  First of all, my stupid Handspring crashed all the time.  Second, it ate batteries like a hog - where the Palm V didn't need batteries because it has the recharable Lithium Ion battery.  Third, it is the same bulkiness as the Palm Pro.  Fourth, there was no place for the stylus. And last, but definetely not least, the springboard module's turned out to be a joke - the release dates on them kept slipping.  I guess part of my problem is being an early adopter - but I sure did miss my Palm.So I gave in and did what any gadget junkie would do.  I sold the Handspring and upgraded to a Palm Vx.  And happy happy happy am I.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Why you should buy a PalmVx vs Handspring", "unixReviewTime": 970531200, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2000"}
