I wish that I had purchased a Handspring Visor instead.I agree with all the positive comments that the other reviewer make regarding this unit.  The unit is robust (helpful if you drop it), convenient (fits nicely into your pocket), has easy to use software and comes with enough memory that you can download a lot of mail to read offline.However, it is just too expensive when compared to other handheld units.  You can get all these great features on a Visor for half the price.  In addition, the handspring comes with cheaper, more interesting plug in cards.The biggest advantage of the palm Vx over the handspring is that is much &quot;sexier&quot;.  Smaller and more streamlined than the Palm III  style Visor.The Palm Vx is convenient, stylish and powerful.  Too bad it is overpriced.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Excellent product but ....", "unixReviewTime": 984614400, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2001"}
