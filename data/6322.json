I would love to now upgrade to a color Palm. However, I am very fearful that I will not find another PDA which offers the durability and longevity I've received from my current Palm. I will continue to use my Palm Vx until it dies - permanently. There were times when I thought it had died, but discovered there was a button that was depressed and I didn't know it.  That caused the battery to die and be unchargeable. Once I figured out the problem, I depressed the button, recharged the unit, and went back to business as usual. I love my Palm Vx!! Is there anything comparable?  If so, please email me at delecia1@cox.net", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still working!!", "unixReviewTime": 1202688000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2008"}
