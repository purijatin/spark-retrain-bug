Sporting a full-size screen (compared to the puny screens on the m100, m105 and m125) and a lithium rechargeable battery, the Palm Vx remains the sleekest, lightest PDA on the market. It fits easily into your hand or your shirt pocket. Now that its price appears to be coming down, it is a great buy, especially compared to the overpriced m125.Palm's newest high-end models, the m500 and m505, are a bit better than the Vx, mainly because of a new card slot and a slightly more tactile feel. The m505 also offers some rather anemic color. But Palm's software hasn't really improved much since the Palm Vx came out, IMHO, and the expansion slot is not so compelling to me that it would be worth paying the additional dough.Also, as an aside, make sure that you download three free add-ons for Palm OS: Avantgo, a service that downloads articles from the New York Times, Sports Illustrated, CNN and others every time you sync your Palm; Vindigo, a city guide with restaurant and movie reviews; and Mapopolis, which has street maps that are keyword searchable.Enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still the standard. Take advantage of the coming price cuts!", "unixReviewTime": 1001203200, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2001"}
