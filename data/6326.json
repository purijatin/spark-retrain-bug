For this short review, I'm going to just focus the Pros and Cons.Pros:- Very Slim (normal wallet size, so you don't need a PDA 'case')- Very Long Battery Life (1 week)- Mature Product Platform (reliable, cheap apps, etc...)- Clear Monochromatic Display in most daylight conditions- Tons of Applications- 8MB is plenty of memory for Calendar, Notes, ToDo, Documents to Go (Word, Excel), and a couple of subscriptions from AvantGo- Easy to find replacement parts- Inexpensive to Buy and Maintain- Tons of Accessories- Bulletproof Metal CasingCons:- Non-Color Screen- Only 8MB of Memory (not expandable)- New Applications Have Longer Load Time- Serial Connection (USB Adapters are Available)- External Adapters Required for Bluetooth and Wireless ConnectivityConclusion:That's my 2 cents.  I just purchased another one for $50 after abusing the heck out of my IBM c3 (it's the same unit as the Vx) for 4 years. I could have bargained him down, but 'mint' for $50 is worth every penny.  For those interested, I think I paid $350 for the c3 back in 2000. Yes, this model is obsolete, but I'll keep it until there is an inexpensive, small, wallet sized PDA with wireless and a comparable battery life.I hope you found this helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Old School and Worth Every Penny", "unixReviewTime": 1095984000, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2004"}
