The problem is I stopped carrying it everywhere (especially afterhours) because it just got so big.  I got the Palm Vx a few months ago and it has completely replaced my  dayrunner.  It totally syncs with my outlook so I have the one schedule at  the office and on the Palm.  I have more than 300 contacts with phone,  email, addresses and notes. I have the last 30 days worth of email  messages.  I have the latest fodor's guide for my home city and the ability  to download any city I am visiting.  I have the a daily listing of the  current movies, which theaters are showing, and the times.  I have hearts  (a favorite card game - with jack of diamonds is worth -10).  I can take  short notes and make reminders. It beeps to let me know when the next  appointment is going to happen (let's see a dayrunner do that!).  And I  have barely scratched the surface of what this thing can do.  If you are  considering getting a PDA -- I cannot recommend this device enough.  Oh,  and it is so small that I take it everywhere...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WOW", "unixReviewTime": 959904000, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2000"}
