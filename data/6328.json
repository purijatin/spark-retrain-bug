Moreover, the stylus slot is very easy to slip out with little to any contact, and this was not caused by overuse. I understand it is a few years old (at least since the original V), and it is very thin, but other then that, there is not much to this.The backlight is very straining on the eyes, and makes the cool indiglo color of the Clie look heavenly. The screen is not very sharp, but it is slightly larger then the S-320 which is a plus.No expansion slots, and (...) it is hard to recommend such a product thats 8mb will be used and you'll be left wanting something with an expansion slot, like an m500 series or any Clie model.This appears to be a last ditch attempt to make money off of an inferior product. And I am glad the family member that has this was issued it at work and does not own it.Get a cheaper S-320 with more features, or higher end Sony model, or a Palm m500 instead.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Why does this thing get good reviews?", "unixReviewTime": 1007337600, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2001"}
