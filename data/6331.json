It's the ultimate geek toy.  Well designed for use.  Two negatives: 1. I've already had it freeze up once and force me to hard reset it. So, get in the habit of hotsyncing everyday. 2. Shame on Palm for selling an appliance, meant to be carried around in your pocket or purse, and not providing a good protective case for it. Plan on spending another $30 to $40 to buy a case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good product, but not cheap", "unixReviewTime": 977011200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2000"}
