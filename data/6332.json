Easy to use, switches very easily. Note that it converts composite video to svideo & vice versa. So you only need to make one video input connection(svideo or composite video).  Highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audio/video switch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice little product", "unixReviewTime": 1112659200, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2005"}
