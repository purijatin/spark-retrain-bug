This despite the fact that my TV had three video inputs to begin with.  These days a couple of inputs isn't enough.  Especially when you count video game systems, and camcorders.  Getting this saved me from having to swap cables all the time, which is what I was duing until I got it.  It's simple to use, just plug and click.  It's a great time saver.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "indispensable", "unixReviewTime": 1040601600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2002"}
