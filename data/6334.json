I have an older TV with only ONE hookup on the back.  This device requires TWO hookups on the back of your TV...so, I had to return it.  However, I did purchase another device from this same seller.  I called their tech number and they told me exactly what I needed, gave me the item number to enter online and the cables I would need and the item numbers for them.  They have a GREAT tech team there and they were VERY helpful.  I returned this item, but ordered another one from them that DOES work.  GREAT site to work with.  I will purchase from them again when I need any electronic device.  THANKS tech support from Parts Express for helping me with my problem....\"you're the greatest!!\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It wouldn't work on my TV...but, I'm sure it's a good product", "unixReviewTime": 1215561600, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2008"}
