So what do you do when your DVD player, satellite receiver, Playstation, TiVo, etc want those for themselves?You can either move your television and plug/unplug whatever you're going to use at the time (which can drive you nuts, not to mention wear out your connectors), or just invest in one of these little things.I love how simple the Recoton is. You just plug your stuff into the back of it (up to 4 different devices), then run another set of cables from the &quot;out&quot; jacks to the back of your TV. That's it! I've seen other little boxes that do the same thing for hundreds of dollars, and need electricity to work. A total waste of money, in my opinion. I keep my Recoton on top of my television set, and switch between each device with a push of a button now. No more having to deal with wires everywhere or moving the TV.The Recoton doesn't come with extra cables to run from the back of it to your TV set, so if you don't have some spare A/V and S-Video cables around, be sure to get a set. I personally use the brand from Monster Cable, which has wonderful picture quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great little device for your home entertainment center", "unixReviewTime": 972432000, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2000"}
