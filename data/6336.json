For just $20 this little device came to my rescue!There's  a MUCH more expensive version in the Crutchfield catalog (like $150).  Sure  that one has a few extra bells and whistles but I don't think it justifies  teh $130 extra (like a remote that only has 3 buttons...? )This sucker  is all you need if you own a DVD, VCR, Game Station, etc...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Saved me +$300!", "unixReviewTime": 959990400, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2000"}
