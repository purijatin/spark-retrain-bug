This device is areal dandy for hooking things up to your home entertainment system,and for connecting things to the computer it can't be beat.  I have atuner to play my Mp3's through, with bookshelf speakers, analogcamcorder, VCR, remote feed cameras from a company called X-10, allsorts of stuff.  S-video is only used for other S-video connections.You can buy a gizmo which will convert AV into S-video, right here atAmazon, but it costs about a hundred bucks and isn't worth it becausethe quality doesn't improve.  It just eliminates a connector on onepart of the system.  Instead of plugging and unplugging things fromthe back of my computer I just have this one switchbox and reach upand punch a button down.  I have one on my computer and one on my homeentertainment system, and it works on either system quite well.  Whatis cool about reaching around into the back of your system wheneveryou want to change something because of a lack of connections?  Forthe computer sound system it gives you the flexibility of inputting tothe line-in, and if you have an All-In-Wonder video card or two, likeI do, you can hook up arrangements for sound video input, as well ashaving a firewire.  For [the money] this thing is a great piece ofequipment, and if I didn't think so I wouldn't have two-count`em, two-of them in my house already.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy Device Does What it is Designed for!", "unixReviewTime": 987206400, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2001"}
