Well, for one thing, the price for these things have really come down over the years. I remember when a large capacity case such as this one used to cost up to 50 bucks(!), which, in my opinion, was way overpriced. I'm glad to see that the price has dropped to a reasonable level. I like this case. It's easy to retrieve and insert CDs from and back into the pages. The outside material feels better than the old- school faux leather. So, if you're in the market for a case to store all your freshly ripped music and flicks, this is a good choice for the frugal shoppers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "solid quality. reasonably priced", "unixReviewTime": 1103155200, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2004"}
