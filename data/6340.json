But being that I have well over 1,000 cd's approaching 2,000 I need something big for storage so decided this was the best bang for the buck.  This case is well constructed and doesn't tear although some reviewers would have you think it tears just by looking at it.  If you feel the need to carry over 200 cd's with you wherever you're going you're an idiot in the first place, this case is perfectly suited for what I need STORAGE. These cases have a cleaning wipe in the front that is attached to the case which is something you won't find in a case logic case that people seem so orgasmic about, which by the way I have two of and they aren't as good as this. Anyway, I bought 3 of these now and when I fill the last one up I will buy another and another these are the best value you will find anywhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent cd case and cheap too!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1054771200, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2003"}
