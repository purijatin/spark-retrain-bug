You shouldnt have to worry about scratching your cds up on the zipper when you try to slide them back in. Get a Case Logic cd folder instead they use ring binders for better organization of the pages. This product is slightly less than average, even though it is only a cd folder they could have made it better for the cost.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Holds a lot but....", "unixReviewTime": 1048550400, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2003"}
