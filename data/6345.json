Fellowes' construction is tighter, CD pages better designed, zipper a lot more sturdy. The built-in polish cloth is likewise clever (albeit somewhat useless being physically attached to the case).Perhaps I stand alone, but in my humble opinion ringed enclosures are a nuisance in larger capacity CD wallets. Simply put, these wallets can't handle the bulk weight of the CD's, not to mention the girth of the pages squashed into them. This Fellowes case (plus a similar CaseLogic offering I purchased last year) can handle what its designed to...and well.In sum, this case is a steal at this price. SuperSaver shipping makes you feel almost as if Amazon is paying YOU for it. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hello, Fellowes, goodbye CDProjects", "unixReviewTime": 1149033600, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2006"}
