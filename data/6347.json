They both work fine, though I prefer the smooth faux-leather outer covering of the CaseLogic to the rougher, more fabric-like feel of this one.  Just a personal preference, though.These books work really well for cutting down on the amount of space that CDs and DVDs take up.  The little CD booklets fit in the slots too, so you can put those in there beside the disks to make them easier to find.They make these in different sizes, but this is a pretty good compromise in terms of size and weight.  The larger folders will save more space vs. multiple smaller ones, but the CDs and DVDs really get heavy in the higher numbers.Koskin DVD Binder 200 Capacity .", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for reducing the shelf space of your CDs and DVDs", "unixReviewTime": 1086480000, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2004"}
