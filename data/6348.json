True, it is not the best looking and at times even feels poorly built, but it holds up pretty well.I prefer this organizer because of its binding. Organizers with riveted, ring-binder style binding, etc. tend to give way very quickly. Fellowes bindings have multiple points of contact and are very durable.Another important thing for me is access to my media. I hate badly designed organizers, whose zippers sratch my media while trying to remove or put media back. This organizer has been designed to permit the least amount of interference.For those who need more assurance, Fellowes makes all (gorgeous!) CD organizers for Body Glove.One star for the blandness in looks and the not-so-tough &quot;looking&quot; zipper...I prefer the Body Glove zippers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great way to organize your CD/DVD Collection", "unixReviewTime": 1087776000, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2004"}
