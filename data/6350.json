I was considering the Case Logic Wallet but it is about [price]more than the Fellowes. The construction of the Fellowes is good and similar to my other Case Logic Wallets, the carrying handle is especially usueful as it can get pretty heavy when full. My only gripe is the design of the plastic covering for each CD slot. It is basically an oval shaped hole in the plastic placed near the hole of the CD, while you can grasp the CD hole and top of the edge of the CD to start to remove the CD, you will reach the end of oval so you'll have to pinch the top of the CD to remove it from the wallet. For this case you can't grab the hole of the CD and the edge and remove the CD in one motion. Nevertheless this can easily be fixed by cutting the plastic to open up the hole. Doing it that 224 times was major pain but worth it as it is alot easier to remove CDs now.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lots of space and a good price.", "unixReviewTime": 995673600, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2001"}
