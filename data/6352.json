Better to use 1/2 the capacity, and place them one next to the other, if you can afford the space.The book is large and well made. Personaly I would prefer such a thick book to be harder cover, with 'O' ring binder, which it isn't.The pages are binded to the cover so you cannot move pages around, but rather have to move the disks. It is harder to alphabetize and add CD's this way.Bottom line, a good, well built basic product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It is good for what is is, but not brilliant", "unixReviewTime": 1142380800, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2006"}
