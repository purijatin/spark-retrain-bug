I ordered 2 at the same time. As I started to fill the pages, I started seeing the first of several problems. Pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper. Speaking of zipper, it is very hard to work when the wallet is full. The other day, I wanted to see about getting more CD wallets (not necessarily Fellows) when I read the reviews here for this wallet. I read the part about not putting cd's in the inner pockets because they would bend. I went home and checked mine. Sure enough, when the wallet is full, the cd's are slightly bent. I would imagine if they were left that way for a period of time, they would probably stay curved.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fellows CD Wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1102636800, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2004"}
