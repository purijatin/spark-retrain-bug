The loose-leaf design, stronger construction,(the handle especially), and greater ease of access make it the first choice. I cut down the booklets,etc, and was able to fit the the full 264 with all the extras, still with good access. To have all of my boxes metamorphized into one sleek package (not much larger that my full-size binoculars' case), makes me happy every time I look over at it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "five for the idea", "unixReviewTime": 1073001600, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2004"}
