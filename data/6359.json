Fendrick", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Bought this after I realized twelve years of computing equals a heck of a lot of optical disks...  The sleeves are at least as soft on the disks as the newer Case Logic carriers I have, and definitely softer than the pre-1997 Case Logic carriers!  It seems durable enough, and with a carrier of this size the sewn-in pages are probably better than a binder.  This carrier is probably not the best for portable storage - the carrier really doesn't open well unless it's sitting on a flat surface.  But for my purposes - sitting under my desk as an archive - it fits the bill just fine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good item for the price, if not used for portability", "unixReviewTime": 1169078400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2007"}
