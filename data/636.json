Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet,so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Expensive, breaks easily", "unixReviewTime": 1345420800, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2012"}
