I have used fellows brand before.  I out grew my case logic cd/dvd holder a few months ago.  For the price the fellows is a good product but the handle is kinda generic and the overall looks is blah. It can hold 256 CD's no problem and came with a cloth to wipe of the dust.  I like the feel of my Case logic holder but if I upgraded to 256 version I would had to have paid $10-15 more.  I am happy with my purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good not the best", "unixReviewTime": 1140825600, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2006"}
