It's easy to use (and I agree with most of the comments below) and takes good quality pix. (Most of mine are flowers/birds.) I use the NiMH rechargeable batteries - have two sets - and have no problems; they last much longer than the NiCD ones. I use a Microtek reader connected to my Mac's usb port (and with an earlier Mac, used a card.)My only big complaint is the lag time between seeing and taking the shot - often a problem with birds. Question: are any of the cards better/quicker than others? I have a SanDisk. I am also thinking about upgrading to the 995, but wish it used AA batteries.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fine little camera", "unixReviewTime": 998438400, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2001"}
