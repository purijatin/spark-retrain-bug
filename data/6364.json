It certainly gets the job done, and the images are as good as what I've gotten with my 35mm SLR, if not better.  My main beefs are the ones that are well known about this camera:  the flash and zoom are both very limited (to the point where I pretty much consider this an outdoor camera - the one time that I did use it indoors extensively,  I set the sensitivity to ISO-400 and shot by available light), and I wish it were possible to manipulate the f-stop and shutter speed directly.  And I've got a new beef:  Due to the small size of the camera,  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the LCD screen.  But these notwithstanding, it is a great camera that takes good, well exposed crisp pictures, and that's the bottom line.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 984787200, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2001"}
