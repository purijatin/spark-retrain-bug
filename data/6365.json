Costa \"Nikon & Apple Enthusiast!\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Ok, so this camera will not be able to take photos that can be blown up to a poster size.  However, I bought this camera fairly cheap (just under two-hundred dollahs) earlier this year and it is fantastic! It's sturdy, the glass is sharp and the photos look amazing.  The color, the white balance and the contrast are just spot on.  Just look at photos taken by this camera by this camera on flickr, and you'll see this thing takes some beautiful photos!! It's quick to focus, it's got great battery life and snaps photos really quick!  You won't regret buying this camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Who needs all those megapixels?", "unixReviewTime": 1321315200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2011"}
