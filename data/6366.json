Sharp pictures, excellent focusing &amp; light weight.Here are some negative points if that's what you are looking for -1. It is a battery hogger. The 4 energizer (alkaline) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about 20 pictures. You NEED rechargeable NiMH battery. .... Andthe charger is [even more money]. You don't really need the optional AC adapter. It is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the PC.2. The 8MB CompactFlash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default. At normal compression, you can have only 16 pictures. I feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default. 640x480 is only available in advanced options. At 640x480, the 8MB card can hold 102 pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me. But if you want to stick to 1600x1200, you may be better off considering a card with more capacity.I decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable (as in the case of battery usage) or not applicable to all (as in the case of resolution &amp; storage size).I had been using Nikon N50 (non-digital) for years and had fallen love with that camera. I guess the N50 will have to excuse me now !!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent is the only word !!", "unixReviewTime": 975715200, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2000"}
