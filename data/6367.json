This is not a point and shoot camera, because you have to override some of the automatic settings when there is backlight or even frontlight.  I would not recommend it for anyone who hasn't had a 35 MM that they had to tweak the picture.  The best thing about this complaint is that you can view the picture immediate and reshoot it again.  One reason I got the 800 instead of 880 is that it takes 4 AA batteries and the 4 AA rechargeables are less costly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you liked working with a manual 35 MM, the 800 is 4U", "unixReviewTime": 985219200, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2001"}
