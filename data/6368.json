Why, you ask? Well, this Coolpix is quite old (in terms of digital) and you'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera. Here are the details why:Megapixels. The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures, but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel.  (More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality. ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference!)Zoom. The 800 has a 2x optical, plus 2.5 digital zoom lens; however, the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom.  You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy!Memory. Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash, but most people would agree that this isn't enough.  Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you'll be happy you did.Downloading. The 800 only connects via serial port, but the 880 connects via serial OR USB. THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer, but the serial (800's only method) is horrendously slow.Batteries.  THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries, but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries. The 880's batteries also weigh less.Price. This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ($499) over the 880 ($699).  But let's face it, if you have $499 for the 800, you should fork over the extra $200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year. The 800 is being phased out by Nikon. RUN to the 880 today! :)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good camera, but go for the Nikon Coolpix 880", "unixReviewTime": 987206400, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2001"}
