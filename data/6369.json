Apart from that it takes good pictures and at the price it's selling for now it's a good entry into digital photography. The optional lenses are great and will transfer to other Nikon models later if you upgrade.I prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger, because of the way the body twists. This makes it so you can see the LCD when you're holding the camera over your head pointing down, or down by your knees pointing up. Great for pics of kids, crowds, etc. The Nikon 900 series are the only still cameras I know of that do this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great value+pic quality if you don' t need lots of features.", "unixReviewTime": 975715200, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2000"}
