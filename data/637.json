After 2 years it finally broke, and I didn't even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one. I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I don't seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though, which is where everyone is having problems. So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue. For that it loses a star, but because I personally haven't had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I don't seem to have the same problems everyone else has", "unixReviewTime": 1358294400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2013"}
