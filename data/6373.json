This camera gave me good results on a recent trip to Europe.* the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera.  I took over 80 photos before I needed to change the batteries, and was not too stingy with the review mode.  That is not great but certainly not as bad as I was led to beleive.*  the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot, unless you are super careful.  Get used to it.* The software isn't that great, but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with.* The camera is not very good for action shots, but that was not a major issue with me.* the camera is a little bit big, compared to say the Canon Elph, but not really too big or heavy.This camera is very good value for the money, I might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras.  Overall I was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures from my DC 280, and my wife was quite impressed with the picture quality as well.  I only wish it had a little more optical zoom ability, a burst mode, and more memory.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good camera, only a few minor nits", "unixReviewTime": 972950400, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2000"}
