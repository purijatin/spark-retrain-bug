I researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and  price to come available. When I saw the DC280 for $447.00 (compared to the  near-$700 it was a few months ago), I knew the time was right and pulled  the trigger...Everything I need in a personal/professional camera is  basically here. The photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything  you'd expect. When people see a photo from the DC280 printed on the HP970C,  they are taken aback at how good it really looks. One of the greatest  sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the  quality of the paper that was used. I have hundreds of family photographs  from the 1940's to 1999, which vary widely in how clear they look. But no  matter how good the best studio photographer's shot looks, it cannot  surpass the clarity of the DC280's best pictures.The DC280 is not a  perfect camera. There are saturation problems, as well its greedy use of  batteries. The 8MB FlashCard that comes included has to be one of the  reasons the camera is so inexpensive, along with there not being any AC  adapter included.The Kodak software works perfectly in Windows 2000, but  is flakey in Windows 98 SE. However, one hidden bonanza came to light when  I used ThumbsPlus 4.1 to acquire the images off the camera; you can save  them as lossless TIFF files instead of the default JPEG files that the  camera uses.This camera will help my business and will help me be as  creative as I want to be. It was worth every penny I spent. You should give  it a try as well...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More Than Meets The Eye", "unixReviewTime": 962582400, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2000"}
