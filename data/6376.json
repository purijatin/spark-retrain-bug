It is easy to learn, easy to use, and produces beautiful pictures. Congrats to Kodak for including the charger with batteries, and the regular batteries  so I was able to take pictures as soon as the camera arrived. Congrats also  to Amazon for having the best price I could find on the web. The software  works well but I wish Kodak had included the home version of Adobe instead  of the business version. This camera is a definite winner and I highly  recommend it to both the beginner and experienced photographer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a terrific camera!", "unixReviewTime": 963705600, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2000"}
