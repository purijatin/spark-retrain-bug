I'm not a camera maven but I've just had a terrific experience with this camera.  Our pictures come out clear and sharp.  It is easy to use. The color is great.  The camera feels good in my hands.  Mine came with a 32 mb card and I bought one extra 32mb card.  I can travel for weeks at a time without ever worrying about &quot;film.&quot;  I've even dropped the camera by accident a few times without breaking it.  The flash works nicely in a variety of light.  If I had to find one thing to criticize I would pick the zoom lens but I have yet to see a competitive product with a better one.  In short, I've taken thousands of pictures with the camera without a hitch.  In fact, I usually have a big smile on my face when I see the results.  And my friends and family do too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Terrific camera - easy to use - fabulous pictures", "unixReviewTime": 1000252800, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2001"}
