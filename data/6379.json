Pucher\"", "helpful": [56, 64], "reviewtext": "I have used three cameras lately: 1) Sony DSC-505  2) Olympus C-2020 3) Kodak DC280 All three have 2.1 Megapixel and good lenses. The Sony is the only one with no Zoom, but has the best picture quality and the best  lowlight exposure. There is also the DSCF505 which has the huge 3xzoom  lens, but it is too big to be nice. The Sony is also the smallest and the  easiest to use. The operating system is similar to the DV camcorders. The  second best is the Olympus C-2020 due to its zoom lens, the viewfinder and  just weaker in low light conditions. The 130 pictures will fit onto a 64MB  Smartmedia in HQ, a little more than with Sony. The Kodak I liked the  least, mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors  (in comparison). I currently use the Olympus for professional work and the  Sony due to its breast pocket size to snap great photos anywhere and  anytime.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A real world comparison", "unixReviewTime": 952387200, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2000"}
