Before I go on, let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the Kodak 3400.  However, I see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the 3400 (no rechargeable battreries).Let me talk about the camera.  It is very simple to use, yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers.  The annoying feature that makes me give this a 4 star rating is the location of the LCD screen - I found that if I use my right eye (which is my dominant eye) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the LCD screen and smudges it.  Come on Kodak, that was a goof.  This does not effect the quality of piuctures, its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the LCD clean.Other than that, it is terrific.  I immediately purchased a Sandisk 32 meg compactflash card, and have since ordered a 128 mb card ....  Battery life is long (I do use the power save mode, which is not on by default).A few tips.  Once you experience digital photography you'll discover that, just like videos, things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it.  Also, this does have a limited telephoto power with just a 2x optical lens - not a problem for me, but you need to know what you want (if you want much more than 2X, I think you should look at an SLR model).Buy this one, its a great value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost the perfect camera, but ...", "unixReviewTime": 972172800, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2000"}
