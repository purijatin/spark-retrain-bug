I also purchased an Olympus D340R for a friend, and  although it is only 1.3 Megapixels, the color is much better, the pictures  blow up almost as well, despite the lower res., and the LCD display is  sharper and easier to view in daylight. Considering the huge difference in  price, the Olympus is a bargain. Of course it does not zoom, but you can  hardly call the 60mm of the Kodak a real zoom. Having used zoom lenses on  35mm SLRs for years I can testify that the 30 to 60 zoom is more like  medium wide angle to normal view, rather than true zoom. You will have to  buy an accessory 2X lens and adapter to get true + zoom. If you want a less  expensive, good performing, zoom camera, check out the Olympus D450 Zoom.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not all it is cracked up to be.", "unixReviewTime": 947462400, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2000"}
