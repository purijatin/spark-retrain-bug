If I print a 4\"x6\" on my HP 952C it is hard to tell the difference from a 35mm camera.Function: The  camera could use a better design but it is still much better than some  other ones I have tried. The review screen is perfectly placed where your  nose hits it when you are taking a picture so I am constantly cleaning it  off.In high quality mode mine holds about 30 pictures (20meg card).  This is plenty for most events/photo ops. After I take 3-5 pictures I go  back and review them and delete the ones that I don't like. This way, when  you have 30 pictures in your card they are 30 pictures that you like. Much  better that taking a whole roll of 35mm pictures and only liking 5 of them  once they are developed.Overall I love the camera (and so do all my  friends that try it).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera!", "unixReviewTime": 958003200, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2000"}
