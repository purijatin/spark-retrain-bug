In fact, it performs as well as its replacement, and costs a good bit less. For a 2 meg camera, it offers a great deal. It is well built, has great optics, a 2X true zoom, decent battery use, USB support and enough user controls to make it an acceptable camera for a semi-serious photographer. The resolution is more than adequate for internet apps and good enough for printing clear 8 x 10s. It is also very sturdy. I think that while supplies last, it is the best 2 meg around and would be an awesome Christmas present for almost anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get it now before it's gone.", "unixReviewTime": 974160000, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2000"}
