The second one did not do to well, this one that I got from Amazon works JUST LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED to work, it took me through a 50 year high school reunion with shining colors!!  It was interesting to photograph all around this boarding school, many things had changed, but many were similar or the same.  I have MANY pictures now that I can look at to remind me of my 50th anniversary of my graduation.  Thanks, Amazon, you did well!!Richard L.
