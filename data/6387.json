While USB is nice, not all computers  have it, and Windows 98 is necessary.  Also the 30-60mm zoom is no where  near as good as I would have liked-- DEFINETLY a 3x zoom is required.  While the resolution is nice, remember that that's not all to a digital  camera.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice First Impression, But Get To Know Him", "unixReviewTime": 956707200, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2000"}
