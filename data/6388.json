It is very user friendly and consistently takes good pictures, no matter who is taking them (Unlike several Sony's I tried before settling on this one).Their are several features on this camera that make it particularly appealing to me.* Accepts any type of AA battery and comes with rechargeable ones* Transfers pictures through USB (can also get a compact flash card reader, I highly reccommend).* Has a Video patch cord that allows you to preview pictures on any TV or VCR with an RCA input.* Accepts Flash Memory of any brand up of 196 MB+ (alot of pictures).* Border software allows you to import different borders for your shots, such as birthdays and weddings.Although the camera is only a 2.0 megapixel, I've learned megapixels don't tell the whole story for the quality of a picture. They only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above 5x7 (8x10 takes a dip in quality).Overall a very good camera for an enry level to average user.If you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs, you might checkout the Nikon coolpix 900 series, a very good camera, though it is twice the price of the Kodak 280 zoom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great point and click Digital Camera", "unixReviewTime": 1010707200, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2002"}
