The battery still not dried up before I quit!I own this baby for more than 6 month. Yesterday I bought a 128 MB compactflash memory from amazon. Now I realize it is too much for this camara. It can store 206 pictures with 1800 X 1200 resolution. Boy!The only drawback of this camara is the delay between shots. First 3 only delay 3 seconds, but after that, needs about 25 seconds to process.Other than that, it is perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality and Value", "unixReviewTime": 991180800, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2001"}
