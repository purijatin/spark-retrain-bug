I inherited it in like new condition. I'm a \"moderate-advanced amateur\" photographer, own several cameras including a Sony/Minolta DSLR. This camera, as others have noted, takes VERY good pictures and is well made and easy to operate. Many times higher resolution just isn't needed, especially if you do a lot of web photography like I do. Put an upgraded CF card in it (a CF slot instead of SD/XD/whatever are another sign of quality) and you're good for hundreds or even thousands of shots!The only down side is that it *is* slow by today's standards. Its highest ISO is only 200 if I remember correctly (maybe not even that high), and CF write times are a bit on the long side. The proprietary USB/Serial connector is annoying in 2011, the original cable for mine is long gone and you can't use a standard USB cable - which isn't a real big problem since I generally use a card reader anyway.I'd say this camera is much better built, and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 \"blister pack\" cameras out there - as long as 2MP is enough resolution.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well made, takes great pix!", "unixReviewTime": 1321920000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2011"}
