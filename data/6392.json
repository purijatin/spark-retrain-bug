A picture is worth a thousand words and this camera is worth the price.  It  is easy to use, comfortable, and easy to download to a PC.  It is also very  durable.  Many people use this camera and it has gone through some abuse in  an industrial environment.  The pictures have real nice color details and  sharpness.The software that comes with it isn't the greatest.  I  recommend Photosuite III or MS Home Publishing to get the most out of your  digital pictures.Extra memory is also a must have.  Invest in a 32 or 64  mb memory card and you can take pictures all day.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "We use this camera for work all the time.
