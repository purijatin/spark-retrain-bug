There is no comparison. The DC290 takes true photographic qualitiy pictures. I tried the camera in a variety of difficult lighting situations. It took perfect pictures every time! The software interface is great. It makes the camera  look like another drive letter in your computer. When the camera is plugged  into the computer (USB port), the drive letter appears in windows explorer.  You can then simply navigate and use the standard cut and paste tools to  move the files. I am extremely impressed with the qualitiy of the pictures,  ease of use, and clear instruction manuals. The camera does eat the  batteries. It comes with a set of disposable (so you can use the new camera  while the others are charging) and rechargeable with charger. I purchased a  second set of rechargeable batteries. I simply charge one set while the  other is in use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WOW!", "unixReviewTime": 946684800, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2000"}
