The amount of time that passes from when the shutter release is pushed, and the time that the camera actually takes the picture seems like an eternity. I'm sure its only 2-3 seconds, but I've missed out on a few moments because of that time lapse. Would I suggest my friends buy this camera? Yes, and I have. But if you are buying it to cover sporting events, you should look for something with a shorter &quot;think-time.&quot; (my terminology for the shutter lag)***Update 7/21/01 I've owned this now for over a year. I've really come to love it. When I bought this camera it was a couple hundred dollars more than what it is now, but I decided it was going to get treated like any other camera that I have owned. Which means I've done everything except try to pound nails into wood with it. I bought a 128mb CF card to go with it- a must in my opinion. I wanted to upgrade to the Kodak DC4800, but that was a mistake. The DC4800 is a mess compared to the DC290. (the only thing good about the DC4800 was the software upgrade. My computer used to take about 15 minutes to shutdown, now it takes seconds. If you buy the DC290 get the latest software and drivers from Kodak) If you already own the DC290 and are thinking about taking Kodak up on there trade-in towards a DC4800, don't do it. The DC4800 has so many dead pixels that color rendering is atrocious, it's also so cheaply put together that I would be scared to treat it the way I do my DC290 . The DC290 may be oddly shaped and heavy, but its a sturdy workhorse.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This is indeed a good camera, and I like it a lot, but...", "unixReviewTime": 966816000, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2000"}
