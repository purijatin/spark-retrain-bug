The camera worked great, then mysteriously started displaying an E11 code when I tried to turn it on. When I looked into the Owner's Manual, I found that E11 indicates corrupt firmware.I went to a couple of camera shops around Dallas, TX, but apparently only Kodak's service center in Illinois has access to replacement parts.Called Kodak and got the address to send it to along with an authorization number. They wanted $342 to replace the firmware. It only cost $369 when new! When I refused to pay this, they still charged me $45 to get it mailed back.I will never buy another Kodak, and if this review sways others from buying a Kodak - I will be happy. **Kodak: This is terrible service and disrespect to customers who drop a lot of money for one of your products.**If anyone wants to offer me anything for this camera (maybe someone out there knows how to repair it), feel free to contact me with an offer. (11-October-2003) Sorry, but Amazon won't let me leave my email address. ~Joe Pool", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Terrible Kodak Support", "unixReviewTime": 1065830400, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2003"}
