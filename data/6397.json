This is a very good camera, but not quite perfect.  It has a lot of nice features that are standard on digital cameras these days, a nice LCD screen that eats the batteries away at an alarming rate, and is nicely contoured to hold.  The picture quality is excellent for my line of work, which requires 4 x 6 photos, the resolution is excellent, and the colors are great (as far as I can tell, anyway).  My favorite quality about this camera is the ease of loading the pictures on to the computer.  Just plug it in, it loads the program, and you pick your folder and the pictures are transferred.There are some negatives about this model, too.  One is the size; it is a bit large compared to other, smaller models.  This may or may not be a problem for many people, but I prefer a smaller camera.  The other is the power button; you have to hold it down for an undisclosed amount of time to get it to go on/shut off.  These are not big complaints, but the camera could have been better.  Kodak's customer service has been top notch.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid camera", "unixReviewTime": 995587200, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2001"}
