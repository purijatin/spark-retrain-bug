Pictures are good quality, and with the price of compactflash comming down it's a good deal.  My only gripe is the compactflash slot is very fragile.  If you switch cards a lot it may break.  In such a case you'll have to send kodak your camera, and they will send you a refurb back.I frankly was disapointed that my month old camera in great condition was replaced with a refurb that was obviously much older with obvious signs of wear and tear, plus a couple dead pixels on the display.  All of which are considered &quot;okay&quot; by Kodak.  I really felt like I paid a new camera price for a used camera.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Feature Set, But Easy To Break", "unixReviewTime": 991785600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2001"}
