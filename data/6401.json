McGraw", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "After much research, I finally decided to buy the DC290 as my first digital camera.  The picture quality is great.  Kodak seems to get the best reviews when it comes to photographic fundamentals; that's the selling  point of this camera - the quality of the pictures is great.  The color  depth of these pictures is phenomenal, and under any lighting condition.You can get over 25 pictures on the 16MB card on the high quality  setting, as good as a roll of film - or much more on the standard quality  setting.The USB transfer is fast and easy, I don't think a card reader  is necessary, so long as you've got the AC adapter(not included) to  conserve battery life.  The camera appears as a drive on your PC.The  only major drawback of this camera plagues all digital cams from what I've  read - battery life.  It's really poor.  I killed the first set in only a  couple hours with minimal LCD screen use and this wasn't continuous use.  Even if you're conserving battery life by all means possible you'll need a  backup set of rechargables, or 2 or 3 backup sets.Also, for [the price] they should've thrown in the AC adapter and maybe even a case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Camera", "unixReviewTime": 967075200, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2000"}
