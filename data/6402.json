However, because the viewfinder and the lens are off-center, you invariably get off-center results - unless you use the LCD as your main viewfinder (this eats battery  life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot  decisions).  However, the image quality is quite excellent for most  outdoor/lighted conditions.The interaction and placement of the  controls are quite good. There are a few key rubber finger and grip  affordances to make the shooter feel in control.  The only cheap part is  the zoom lever.  It's a small horizontal lever, that has to be kicked way  over to one side or the other, and the time delay to lens movement is  sluggish.  The overall construction of the entire body and finish is very  nice. There's plenty of standard features like burst, time-lapse, etc. to  keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy.  A real nice package bonus was  the 4, AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger + 16MB storage card.  At  least Kodak was thinking about the entire user experience.Oh, the PC  software interface is rather silly.  The childlike icons and metaphors for  album creation, etc. makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model  for what is essentially folders/files on your computer.  Something more  straight forward with clear icons and interface is all we want.  Use the  quick access download near the clock once you've installed the software.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product, but its the details that kill it for me", "unixReviewTime": 960249600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2000"}
