The thing that makes these cables great is the isolation from electrical interference (power outlets, any power cables etc) and I personally use it from my idj-pro to a pioneer djm nexus mixer. Couldn't be happier with the build quality. One small small con for me personally is that the cables are not stuck together so i would suggest get a half dozen or dozen of velcro straps to keep things neat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great cables at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 1371427200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2013"}
