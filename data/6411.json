They are WAY TOO TIGHT which makes them very hard to plug in and even worse when its time to unplug them - they are so tight to a point one can damage the RCA jack on the equipment.I wish I had kept the package otherwise these would be back for return in no time.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "over-hyped, pain in the rear connectors, pointless", "unixReviewTime": 1308009600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2011"}
