Crider", "helpful": [2, 5], "reviewtext": "I was shopping for a stereo cable and had good success with Monster cables previously.  What I received were two completely separate (but color-coded) mono cables -- I immediately sent them back for a refund.  I expected a joined double cable.  Amazon's photos do not clearly show that the cables are separate, nor is there anything in the detailed description about this.  I already have too many cables behind my cabinets and on my floor -- why would I want two more when one double cable would suffice?  Conclusion:  the photos are misleading and the description is incomplete.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Don't buy unless you want two mono cables", "unixReviewTime": 1286064000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2010"}
