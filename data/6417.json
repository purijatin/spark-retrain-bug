I got these cause they were here on amazon where I bought my new dvd player.  These cables are a lot more hefty than anything i've ever seen.  I didn't compare quality to any other cables so I don't know about sound quality but it does sound good.  If you're like me you probably want to spend more time infront of the tv than behind it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I don't hear a difference but these things are well built!", "unixReviewTime": 1016928000, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2002"}
