It made an immediate difference to my system.  It sounds clear, transparent, smooth.  Also, I like the directional indicators on the cable which help in installation.My only gripe is that the connectors are cheaply made.  When one of the &quot;grab&quot; pins broke off, I realized the connector is not all metal construction (like you would expect for the price).  The pin was made of plastic - quite a disappointment.  I hoped for better at this price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good sounding cable, but cheaply made connectors", "unixReviewTime": 1056326400, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2003"}
