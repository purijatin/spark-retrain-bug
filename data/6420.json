I really don't want to dive into it but if you feel its over priced, I suggest you google the difference between Monster digital cables(HDMI, Optical, etc) and Monster analog cables, such as this RCA cable.I'm only an audio enthusiast but I worked in Radio Shack back in the day when it was still Radio Shack. If your going to tell me some razor thin, high gauge RCA cable is going to not only save me money but sound just as good as the Monster. Then I wish you the best with your sound setup but your missing out.Shielding matters quite a lot when it comes to analog cables and this cable doesn't disappoint. I also like the fact its about 70% off the regular price if purchased from Amazon. I purchased these for my father in law who saw an instant improvement in sound quality for his HT. I did give the product 1 star off as it does have the infamous, super tight connectors. I understand why Monster wants to do it but they should develop an easier method of twisting and pulling to get them off.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid Monster Cable", "unixReviewTime": 1324771200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2011"}
