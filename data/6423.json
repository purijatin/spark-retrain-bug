The \"M\" in Monster is wonderfully printed and the finger grips feel like work of art.  Other than the connector, I don't have much to say about this cable compared to other Toslink cables.  The innards are really all the same.  I can say that there is a marked improvement over the extended coathanger I had been using previously to connect my receiver to my audio equipment.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Cable!", "unixReviewTime": 1209081600, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2008"}
