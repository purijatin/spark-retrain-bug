When I got my 5.1 set-up, I thought the only way to get 5.1 sound was to use an optical wire anyway.  Well, on my system it was, as it had no RCA jacks for all those discrete channels.  All it has is one optical jack and one set of L/R RCA jacks for a stereo VCR source.So all I did was go to Wal Mart or Radio Shack (can't remember which) and bought the only optical cable they had for like 20 bucks.  Works just fine.  My problem if anything is my receiver.  But I think I'll be upgrading sometime later this year.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Optical is optical", "unixReviewTime": 1116806400, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2005"}
