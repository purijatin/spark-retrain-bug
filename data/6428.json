I'd suggest going for the cheapo Radio Shack cables first, and only upgrade if the perfomance is not satisfactory.  You'll save money more often than not.I bought this set to install in my car for a trunk mounted MP3 adapter, so I needed extra length and suspected that noise immunity would be needed as well.  They work fine, and I have no complaints, but I do want to point out that they are very bulky.  The molded base of the 3.5mm jack is almost as big as my MP3 player, and the cable is like a garden hose!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but bulky", "unixReviewTime": 1201478400, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2008"}
