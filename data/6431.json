However, they do work well, and they are built to survive a long time.  They are incredibly THICK for audio cables.  If you're imagining something the thickness of the typical headphone or PC-speaker wire, you're in the wrong ballpark:  This is closer to the thickness of a power-strip wire.  It's massive... nay, monstrous.  The wire is still very supple and easy to manipulate.  However, if you plan to run it across your living room floor, it will be extremely conspicuous.  Although you could certainly use it as a permanent connection, its massive construction suggests that the intended use is probably in a setting where you will be frequently connecting and disconnecting, packing and unpacking, and generally giving the cord heavy use.  It looks like it will take this kind of abuse fairly well.  The end.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good but expensive", "unixReviewTime": 1133136000, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2005"}
