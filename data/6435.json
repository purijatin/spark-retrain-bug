It is a great product and offered for a great price.  I think the price is lower because of the ugly colors.  It is nice that it is labeled for different entertainment inputs though.  They are color coated, they just make it look like a weird rainbow.  I still like it though and highly recommended the product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great product", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013"}
