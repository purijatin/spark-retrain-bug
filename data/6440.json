It may have been nice to have a coax connection to protect my sat receiver, but I am a bit dubious of the actual utility of coax connection surge suppressors. I suspect that, in general, surges are very rare or nonexistent from satellite dishes to the receivers, unless brought on by a lightening strike, in which case, any surge suppressor would be unlikely to withstand the strike.
