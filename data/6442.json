I have an 8 thousand dollar home entertainment center that is completely setup using nothing by Monster Cable wires. While I know that they are a little overpriced at times, there is a lot to be said for peace of mind and also knowing that you systems are connected using the BEST wires and power sources money can buy.I bought this as a bedroom outlet strip because I have a few things plugged in near my bed and also bought a Bose Sound Dock and didn't want to plug it into a cheap power strip from the dollar store. I have been very happy with this and it's worked perfectly for the first 3 months of owning it. Additionally, with the 40 or so Monster Cable items I've bought in the last 10 years, not ONE of them have failed on me or delivered nothing but top notch performance. If you can about what you are plugging into it, get a Monster Cable power source.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love MC", "unixReviewTime": 1356480000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2012"}
