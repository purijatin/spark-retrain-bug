But this surge protector does not live up to the brand name. After a year or two of use, only two of the six outlets work. When I began to have the problem and contacted Monster, I found myself on hold forever again and again and was provided with no helpful solution to my problem or easy way to have the device replaced. I have other no-name brand surge protectors that have been rocking strong since the 1980s. This one has been a disappointment. The only reason I'm on Amazon today is that I'm shopping to REPLACE this one.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "2 Years in only 2 outlets work", "unixReviewTime": 1362441600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2013"}
