I like the colors, not because I actually plug anything in to certain pliugs, but because it makes it easier to see when you are plugging in items while reaching behind cabinets and what not.The size of the strip seems to be slightly larger, which makes for an easier fit with multiple items connected.I have also had some bad power surges in my house and this item has managed to handle them all very well. I even lost my microwave over one, but my TV and game console were just fine after the surge!Monster makes a superior product!Short and Sweet: Buy this to protect your stuff!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Protection!", "unixReviewTime": 1386720000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2013"}
