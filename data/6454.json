I like the color coding in addition to the pack of cable lables that let you mark what the plug is to/from, I usually make on with masking tape and a magic marker but this is a lot cleaner :)Great product and at a very good price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Something well priced from Monster", "unixReviewTime": 1325721600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2012"}
