Recently, I needed to get another surge protector.  I went to Target to buy one and all they had were only 3ft or 6 ft cords and were $20+.  I looked this one up and was amazed that a Monster product was only 7 bucks.  What a deal.  A name brand at a generic price.  Plus it has an 8 foot cord.  The colors are cool if you frequently changed plugs but for me its just plug in and forget.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Can't beat this for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1369008000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2013"}
