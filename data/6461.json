The slim design makes it take up less room behind the laptop. The right angle outlets allow two regular cords to be plugged in at the same time as two wall-warts, so I can only use four of the six outlets.Designed for Audio-Visual equipment which have standard wall plugs, all six outlets are available. The long power cord allows for convenient positioning even when not close to the wall outlet. I have since ordered more for other locations in the house.The color-coded outlets are labeled for function, but all appear to be identical.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Made, Convenient", "unixReviewTime": 1370563200, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2013"}
