There was difficulty inserting plugs in all 3 units and after 2 weeks one unit completely failed on me. The reset button never popped and there was a smell from the failed unit that usually indicates melting or fused electrical components. No damage to items plugged in but I would advise all not to buy this outlet strip.P.S.> The Second strip failed on me the same way after a couple of weeks usage replacing the first one. Only one of the three is still working...you get what you pay for. I cannot understand how anyone rates this as a good item. I looks great and has a great cord but fails miserably..the proverbial book by the cover story. I will never buy monster products again. I have never had this poor a performance on a power strip in all my life. I did not get any electrical damage to what was plugged in when the failure was incurred but who needs the headache potential. pass on it here", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Cheesy power strip..junk", "unixReviewTime": 1207526400, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2008"}
