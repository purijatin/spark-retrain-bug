It just stopped working. The reset button did not even pop out. I should have gotten the APC or Tripp-Lite suppressor.Pros:Nice long flexible cable that hopefully I can re-use on another project.Cons:Difficult to insert plugs into.Mysteriously stopped working after Amazon return period expired...If this was a joke, then it wasn't even funny...I have like 10 of these things in the house; Radio Shack, Belkin, Tripp-Lite and APC and none of them has ever died in less than 2 months, let alone ever. I even sold my first Tripp-Lite suppressor!
