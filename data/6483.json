The outlets are tight, so you don't have to worry about your cords coming out and losing power.  It might be a bit much, but it's not that hard to get in.  Someone said they had to put their full weight into it to get plugged in, they must be a wimp since a small guy like me was able to easily push it in with a little force.  It looks a bit fruity, but it works really well.  Plus the long cable is nice to have since none of my outlets are near my computer desk.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One heck of a cord", "unixReviewTime": 1217030400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2008"}
