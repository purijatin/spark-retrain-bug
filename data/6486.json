Graham", "helpful": [1, 4], "reviewtext": "The AV600 looks like a pretty standard power strip with bright colors painted on to help you organize and categorize your connections.  Stickers and cable guides come with the strip to help you organize.The strip seems to be well built, but I really can't say for sure whether it can live up to its claims.  I guess only an independent testing lab could do that.As far as the rated protection level, you could probably find another power protector that has a higher rating for a similar price.  However, my experience with the Monster branded products has been favorable, so I really bought this item based on the company reputation and past experience.One benefit of this power protector is that you can plug it in with the flat power connector and move your furniture (if applicable) close to the wall, unlike normal power strips where the plug sticks way out.If you have really high end equipment, or live in Florida as I do, I would recommending spending a little extra for more 'protection'.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not the best protection, but better than standard strips", "unixReviewTime": 1187827200, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2007"}
