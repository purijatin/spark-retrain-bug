You plug things into it, and they work.  Actually the best thing about this one is it comes with little stickers that you can attach to the end of plugs on your electrical devices so if you unplug something, you'll know what it is!  Though, it should include blank ones so you can name things yourself such as PS2 or ROUTER, things like that.  Anyhow this was a great price and this seller ships real quick so you can't lose.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yep, it's a power strip!", "unixReviewTime": 1150675200, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2006"}
