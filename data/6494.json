It works as to shutting of the electrical equipment when you switch the button on or off. I don't know if it will shut down if damaging electrical spikes comes but I expect it does. The size of the product is slim and does not take up much room. The color coded receptacles are very nice and I am very happy I purchased it for the $14.99 low price Amazon was selling it for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Power Surge Protector", "unixReviewTime": 1186272000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2007"}
