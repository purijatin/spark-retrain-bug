This is your basic surge protector strip, with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components. But does it give them sufficient protection? Unfortunately it did not for me. I was using it for my Tivo-TV combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my Tivo. So dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device. So now I get to experience this Monster warranty process. Suffice to say, you will be lucky if you get anything out of them, or can fulfill the requirements and 3 pages of information they want you to send them. In my case, I have a Tivo DVD that no one within several hundred miles of me is \"authorized\" to repair as they require, and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim. I have to order a replacement part on the internet, which they don't accept and they won't reimburse after the fact. You also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well, so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it. So basically, the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself. So you can dock another star or two for that. So while I like the design of this surge protector, I probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at least.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not as good as first impressions indicated", "unixReviewTime": 1175126400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2007"}
