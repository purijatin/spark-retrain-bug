Like another reviewer said, it just kind of feels cheap. I know its just a power strip, and thats why a bought a cheaper one, but it seems a bit inferior for a Monster product. I'm really no fan of theirs, but at least their products LOOK and FEEL as if they are better than the rest. This one, however, seems like it would fall apart with minimal abuse. I have another APC brand surge protector that my computer stuff is plugged into that is far and away superior to this thing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A bit dissapointing", "unixReviewTime": 1186185600, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2007"}
