There is nothing fancy about this strip minus the colors and the labels.  While it is nice for you to have labels so you don't have to follow the cord most of the time the labels will not fit what you are going to plug in there and will just have label them yourself anyway.  if you have the larger plugs like cell phone chargers you are probably going to take up two plugs as they are close together and not really angled for it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just a standard powerstrip", "unixReviewTime": 1376265600, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2013"}
