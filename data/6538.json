I'm not a Monster fanboi or anything.  I just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and I needed one.  I like the layout of the plugs.  It gives you a good variety of spaces for transformers, etc.  I have all my computer and stereo equipment plugged into it and it hasn't missed a beat.  Works for me!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "it works, like the plug layout", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}
