Well, frankly, my knees are getting too old for these floor-level shenanigans and we have a lot of lightning in our area. I bought this item so that I could shut down equipment and plug/unplug with ease. I particularly like the color coding for the different plugs, because that tangled spaghetti behind my TV stand is pretty hard to decipher.The shipping was fast, and packed well. I could not ask for more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just what I needed!", "unixReviewTime": 1331596800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012"}
