I have every confidence that I am getting clean reliable power and surge protection. As well as great cable length. It's easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device, and offers superior cable management options. All around a great product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Its a Monster.", "unixReviewTime": 1314144000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2011"}
