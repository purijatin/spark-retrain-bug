One of the best power strips on the market that have good spacing so if you have larger power supplies it doesn't keep you from using the plug next to it.  I have several of these and have never had one fail.It comes with a cable connector but I've never used it.  I like that they also include some ties and the sticker labels for your equipment.  For the money, you can't beat it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love these", "unixReviewTime": 1380153600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2013"}
