The plug fits fairly flush to the wall socket and the sockets on it hold plugs securely without being too tight. I don't use the cable protectors so I can't speak to that. I highly recommend this to anyone needing a reliable, safe power strip.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great purchase!", "unixReviewTime": 1393459200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2014"}
