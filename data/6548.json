This product meets my needs; it protects a TV, Sat Box, PS3, and a hard drive enclosure.The protector is good quality and has a strong and long cord.  If you do not care that it is labeled for a VCR and don't run coaxial or telephone cable I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable Surge Protector", "unixReviewTime": 1314921600, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2011"}
