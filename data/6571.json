I have purchased many of their products and they are well designed, well made, and protect your electronics.  Are there products as good out there?  Perhaps but this is a great one and it is fairly inexpensive.  I can't say the same for some of the product lines mentioned by other reviewers here as superior.  In my experience monster products stand the test and I will continue to buy from this company.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great product", "unixReviewTime": 1363392000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2013"}
