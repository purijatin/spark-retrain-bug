It's got both cable and phone cord protection, wide spaced plugs on one side for off shape plugs and color coded plugs on the other side. It comes with little color coded tags you put on the cords of your appliances so you know what you're unplugging when it's time to change something in the entertainment center. Extra long chord is just icing on the cake. Will be buying more of these later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "cadilac of power strips", "unixReviewTime": 1202515200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2008"}
