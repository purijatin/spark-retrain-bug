I have connected a 32\" LCD Sony Bravia KDL-32L4000, a mini home theater bought in Amazon (Theater Solution) and a Pioneer bought here too, plus an old Toshiba DVD Recorder to record my cable tv shows. All systems have resisted spikes, brownouts and low voltage due electrical problems here in my area (strong wind hitting cables). The design is sleek comparing with others i have seen before. The coaxial cables of Cable TV are connected through this baby and there's zero bad signal or interference. The price is very affordable for this great protector.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive", "unixReviewTime": 1311811200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2011"}
