If you over AMP this product, it will shut off but will probably never work again. I have two surge protectors that got overloaded and never worked again. Monster has a great warranty & replacement, but they are a bit difficult to get to customer service or help. Make sure you know your jules and amps for what you are using it for. Otherwise, it works great and has decent spacing for 2 larger outlets.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works Well, long life.", "unixReviewTime": 1384819200, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2013"}
