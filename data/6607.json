We get small surges fairly often.  Had three of these units fail within a year.  Get a surge, the powercenter trips and blows the main breaker on that circuit.  Shake the powercenter and you can hear little electronic bits rattling around inside.  Dead and not repairable.  Have a dozen or more surge protectors (different  brands) which are all just fine.  Monster are the only brand that regularly blow out.  They should survive at least several small surges  without actually exploding inside.  Colorful but useless.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Multiple failures", "unixReviewTime": 1402531200, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2014"}
