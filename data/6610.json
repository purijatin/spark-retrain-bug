The color code is nice and I used as applied but I don't have all the things labeled, that is okay used them for other items.It has enough coverage for my items and if there should be a loss I would get enough money to get new items.I feel better protected over my 15yr old surge protector that I have no idea where the proof of purchase is anymore and I know it probably will not cover an HDTV.I plan to get another to replace a second older version.The hardest thing about this is not set up it is getting the clam shell case cut off. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleased with design and promised protection.", "unixReviewTime": 1315440000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2011"}
