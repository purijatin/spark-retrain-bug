I purchased it to handle those (transformer/plug) devices that I have connected to my computer. I have two other similar types  of strips and this one is probably the best of the bunch (as being advertised as &#34;made for transformer/plugs&#34;). The problem is that there are many different size, shape and angle of the plugs. and depending on what you have you seldom can make use of all the outlets, there is just not enough space between outlets.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1385251200, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2013"}
