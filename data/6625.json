Plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didn't work.  No power to the unit at all.  The seller accepted the item as a return, no problem. I didn't have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order, including original shipping charge, was refunded, so I was pleased with that, at least.  I've learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky, but with Amazon I have NEVER had a problem with any return.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Item was defective", "unixReviewTime": 1328832000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2012"}
