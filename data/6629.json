Bauman", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "When I first hooked up my new HDTV and DVR, I couldn't get a signal to the DVR.  When the cable guy came out, he said the problem was a weak signal.  After working on my cable for 30 minutes, it turns out that the \"surge protection\" of the cable coax on this unit loses too much of the signal.  Don't use it.Otherwise, this product is fine...but I could have bought a cheaper one that didn't have these \"extra\" features.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works okay; don't use the coax cable connector", "unixReviewTime": 1254787200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2009"}
