I used iFixit instructions and this drive to make it work.Make sure you plug the cable in the right way.  Drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully.  If you get it wrong, iPod will tell you there is battery failure, but there isn't, it's just the drive in backwards.  I flipped it around and it worked, no harm done.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great replacement for iPod Video hard drive", "unixReviewTime": 1377043200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2013"}
