{"reviewerID": "A6FIAB28IS79", "asin": "B00003CWDH", "reviewerName": "Samuel Chell", "helpful": [55, 60], "reviewtext": "[Since the following was written, the price difference between the Monster and Belkin (both approx. 25) has become decisively gaping (20 and 35), making the Belkin the only sane choice.}Monster is premium quality at a premium price. Musicians will pay more for a Monster patch cord than some folks would pay for an electric piano. But on closer inspection, this power strip is competitively priced.  I recently purchased a 12-outlet Belkin strip at only several dollars below this Monster strip.  But the Belkin would accommodate only 8 of my plugs because 6 of the receptacles are in a vertical row (with the ground holes on the inside, not the outside as is the case with Monster).  Consequently, a right-angle plug took up the space of 3 receptacles, in effect reducing me to the same number outlets as this Monster.Even so, why not save several bucks and get the Belkin?  Two compelling reasons in favor of the Monster (the included HDMI cable isn't one of them): 1. The color coding is a thoughtful timesaver/frustration eliminator (how many times have you found yourself on the floor suddenly at a loss about which device connects to which receptacle?) 2. The well-illuminated surface tells you at a glance whether the unit is connected and receiving power (Belkin units have too few or zero lights, requiring the user to get down on all 4's to determine whether the problem is a loss of power to the strip).I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because only 3 of the 8 outlets are dedicated to those space-robbing power adapters (wall-warts).  Count on the remaining 5 outlets accommodating no more than 2 additional power adapters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Monster vs. Belkin: close call, but price and number of outlets shouldn't be the deciders.", "unixReviewTime": 1219968000, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2008"}
