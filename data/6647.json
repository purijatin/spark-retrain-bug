It is color coded and labeled so you know where your TV, Stereo, etc. is plugged in if you choose to use these.  It also has surge suppression for your cable/satellite connections.  The actual plug and cord that goes to the wall is very long.  I am very happy with this product and think it is a good deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable MP AV 800", "unixReviewTime": 1340409600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2012"}
