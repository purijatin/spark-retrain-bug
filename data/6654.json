The durability of the unit.2. The length of the cord.3. The price.I am not disappointed in any way.  The unit is very sturdy.  It can easily be stepped on or kicked without suffering any kind of damage.  I needed an extra long cord and this unit has it.  The cord is durable and more than long enough for most uses. The price on this power strip was great.  You will not find a price anywhere near this good for a comparable unit in any brick and mortar retailer.I would certainly buy another of these units if I needed it. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great and the price is right", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}
