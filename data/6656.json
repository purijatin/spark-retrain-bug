My neighborhood had power outages often, sometimes several times in one week.  Until the power company figures out how to stop these chronic outages and surges, I need to protect my electronics and appliances.TiVo recommended I use a surge protector with built-in cable connection to protect my tv, TiVo, and dvd players from surges that can occur directly through the cable connection, not just through power outlets.  It was easy to connect the incoming cable line to the Monster unit, then the outgoing cable to the TiVo box (or your cable tv tuner box).  (I don't know if there is a different product for satellite tv systems.)This surge protector has 8 outlets, 3 of which are oversized for larger transistor-type plugs, plus the cable ports (in/out).  I didn't think I'd like the colorful surge protector (I'd prefer other colors), but the color-coding turned out to be quite useful with all my home theater devices' cords.  There are labels that correspond with the outlet colors so you can wrap the appropriate label around the specific cord for fast match-up.  Very happy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lots of ports, cable line protection, plus color-coding convenience", "unixReviewTime": 1375574400, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2013"}
