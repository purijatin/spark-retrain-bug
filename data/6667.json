It will give you plenty of connections for your home theatre devices. The only drawback in my opinion is that it has a high profile which leaves the cables high off the floor (3-4 inches before you can bend the cable). It is not really much higher than average surge suppressors but enough so that I could not tuck it under my entertainment center or mount it on the wall behind without leaving a big gap behind it. I have no doubts about its protective claims. The Monster brand is very reliable and indicates decent quality. I have been buying their cables for years- both for home theatre applications and semi-professional audio gear. If I had to choose again, though, I would try to find something with a lower/more compact profile.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Provides plenty of connections but it is a bit bulky.", "unixReviewTime": 1392249600, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2014"}
