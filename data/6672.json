After doing a great deal of research, as I would suggest anyone do before buying almost anything, I settled on The Monster MP HT800. I'm using it mainly for audio recording, Voice Over work to be exact, where a clean signal is a must. Hooked up my computer, mixing board and amp to this, and right away, the low frequency hum, I've had to pad out, went away. Bought two now, and in the crowded urban environment of LA, I finally have clean sounding power. This is no hype, just the facts. I know some reviewers don't notice a difference, well they probably have less noise to filter out. Hope the surge protection is as good as the filtering. Price was right on Amazon as well. I think I'll get a third for the home theater.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It Works!", "unixReviewTime": 1328832000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2012"}
