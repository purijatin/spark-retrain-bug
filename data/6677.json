This was a cheap price for a high quality product.  First, you have a simple way to lable all your plugs... one of the biggest problems is taking plugs out... this has the plugs color coded and the cord gets a label to color coordinate it.Also the plus work well..  I have not had a chance to test a surge, but I noticed a better picture and sound on my tv... I think it's clean power worked... the other one(I bought two) is installed, but tv works as good as before....It was a great product and price... would recommend it to put all your high tech products in a safe powerstrip... small investment vs a destroyed home theatre equipment.... (explain why you did not do it to your wife after it is destroyed??? - get this now.. you will not be sorry!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It just works... and works well...", "unixReviewTime": 1289520000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2010"}
