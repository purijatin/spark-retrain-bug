This does the job that I need, but do not think it has been truly tested.  I have 3 of these for various setups.  There was a TV that would occasionaly just have sound no picture.  Replacing the surge protector with the monster model seems to have elimated the problem.  When they are reasonably priced (as opposed to most Monster pricing) I believe they are a good deal.  I hope I never have to find out how good they really are or take advantage of the Monster protection plan.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Surge Protector", "unixReviewTime": 1301011200, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2011"}
