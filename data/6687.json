I have 3 big screen TV's, a Samsung 46\", a Toshiba 40\", and a LG 55\". I purchased my first Monster unit about three years ago, where I live we have frequent power surges and some power outages, this surge protector ( Monster MP HT800 ) has saved me a fortune in repair and or replacement costs! Doe's it work, YES! They are well worth the purchase, at one time you would have to pay about $90.00 for one, and now you can get them for $30.00 or less, a great deal for trmendious protection !!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I just purchased my third one !
