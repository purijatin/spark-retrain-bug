MP HT800 is the one I chose from this line.  I like the many features of this surge protector, such as the color-coded outlets that make it a breeze to recognize the purpose of individual outlets.  The outlets come pre- labeled for your components, and matching cord labels are provided for easy and logical hookup. I like the fact that the Monster Cable HT800 comes with a 8 ft. long AC power cable. So many surge protectors use only 6 foot or shorter power cables.  So, this provides ample length for most hook-ups. Another great feature of the power cable is that it has a flat profile plug that is set at a right angle to provide greater flexibility for installations and allows furniture to hug the walls. The power surge protector itself has 8 outlets total, including 3 which are spaced for use with AC adapter transformers. Try to match that with generic power surge protectors! Another quality feature is that all the contacts are 24k gold to allow maximum conductivity.  There's a lot to like in this Home Theater power surge protector and not much if anything to dislike.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a better quality surge protector for their A/V system.  I hope this helps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable quality for a decent price", "unixReviewTime": 1366848000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2013"}
