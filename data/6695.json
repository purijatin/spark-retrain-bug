Even though I'm an old guy who enjoyed the 70's, I still like my music and movies (DTS HD MA) loud but clean.  Last week I was playing Adel (Blu ray-Royal Albert Hall) pleasingly loud and the internal speaker wire connector (one of four) on my Paradigm Sub 15 vibrated off.  The Monster HT800 immediately detected a fault and shut off the power to my system.  I know this definitely saved my $3,500 sub and I wonder had the power not been interrupted I feel that in addition to the sub I would have lost my Denon receiver and possibly all the other speakers in my system too!  The Monster HT800 maintained a warning squeal alerting me to a problem and unfortunately all I could save was the high quality extension cord as the HT800 was dead.  Small price to pay for the cost savings from that Monster unit.........thanks Monster!!!!  I have already relplaced the dead Monster HT800 with a Monster HTS1000MK111.Now I definately am a believer in Monster Cable Power and thank you, thank you, thank you..........\"Monster Cable\"!!!!Peter McNicholSault Ste Marie, Ontario", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster HT800 Saves Paradigm/Denon Home Theatre", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2012"}
