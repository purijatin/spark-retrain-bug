Since I could not find a &#34;Computer&#34; Monster Cable I bought the Home Theater one which seems to be running happily on my computer.  I like a certain amount of protection for my computer, and I chose this.  I realize it won't protect against a lightening bolt, but it does smooth out the jagged power we receive every day, to a great extent.  Smooth power for your computer is important, computers like running on smooth power!  Well, this was my choice to protect my computer (and monitor, printer, etc) as best as I could, and I am very happy with it.  I bought one for my husband also.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic!", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013"}
