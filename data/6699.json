I got two of these for a very low price.  Monster products are pretty pricy, however if you get them on sale they are well made, attractive looking, and have been reliable so far for me.  I have several surge protector/power strips from Monster (all purchased at steep discounts from list) as well as some cables.  They all work fine, and the ergonomics are very good.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1394841600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2014"}
