It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works good, but has some sag", "unixReviewTime": 1360195200, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2013"}
