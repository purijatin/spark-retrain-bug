I specifically needed the cable protection as well as power protection.  Lightning can run in on the cable and fry a flat screen as easily as surging through the power supply.  I was looking at the latest offerings and scrolled down on Amazon to find this product.  Does everything I need for a greatly reduced price.  What's not to like about that?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 1382313600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2013"}
