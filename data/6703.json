{"reviewerID": "AJVGREW8IXDGC", "asin": "B00003CWDQ", "reviewerName": "Agean2010", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I recently purchased this product because I noticed that the electrical spikes in our building have been occuring more frequently and all our entertainment devices (120Hz LED TV, cable box, modem, router, audio receiver, PS3, Wii, VHS, etc.) that are hooked up to the same power source have been affected causing the units to spontaneously shut down or manifest some sort of interference.  Considering the collective value of all the devices in our \"entertainment set,\" I realized that we needed something (a surge protector) that provided more than just surge protection - something that would allow us to fully benefit from the features of the devices.I've been using this product for more than a week now and noticed that the picture quality on our LED TV improved - it is more vibrant and the unit doesn't shut down spontaneously.  The sound quality from our receiver and subwoofer has also improved - the fading effect disappeared.  I also hooked up the TV cable (coaxial) into this surge protector and noticed that it stopped shutting down.  The picture quality on the HD channels also improved.Furthermore, I really appreciated the 9-foot cable of the unit.  The bonus items (coaxial and phone cables) came in handy because I also hooked up the TV cable and the phone/fax line to it.  Some of the the labels on the device could use a little modification.  Nonetheless, I consider this product a bargain ($22 for a $120 value!).  I would recommend this product to anyone who has an entertainment system and values it.  It doesn't make sense to spend so much money on an entertainment set when you're not going to gain the full experience.  This product will allow you to do just that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1303257600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2011"}
