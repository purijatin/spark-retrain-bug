I bought it to protect my brand new 63\" plasma.  For a while it worked fine, but then it started to short out and got to the point where the cable box turned off.  Not wanting to risk damaging my TV, I moved it for use with a simple lamp and phone.  A couple weeks later it started whistling and then turned off completely.  I never had a surge protector do that before and cringe at the thought of the damage it could have done to my plasma.  Stay away from this company.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Failed in less than 2 years, I'm lucky it didnt ruin my TV", "unixReviewTime": 1298073600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2011"}
