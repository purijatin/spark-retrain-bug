The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone.  The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly.  If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Faint high-pitched tone", "unixReviewTime": 1143072000, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2006"}
