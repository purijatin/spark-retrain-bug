I've bought it to power all my devices with US power plug using one US-EU connector, but when I switch that device on I just have a power outage in the room. Now I'm not sure if it is still working at all.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Useless for 220V", "unixReviewTime": 1330905600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2012"}
