There are so many products out there (cables, power, etc.) that are so obviously designed to make money by giving you the cheapest possible components.  I purchase my Monster products with delight because at least they APPEAR to care about quality. I have never actually compared this power strip to another by watching the same video feed and cannot say for sure that it does what it says with regard to filtering AC pollution. BUT, I do know that AC pollution exists and sometimes my mobile video equipment will pick up radio signals and corrupt microphone recordings. This power strip does completely eliminate RF (radio frequency) interference, and that alone made it worth the purchase for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Do I actually notice a difference?
