These Power Center Surge Protector is so good that this is the second time I order 2 new ones. I've been so impressed with these Power Centers, that I had to buy a few more to protect my Theater Center, Computers and other items of true value. Which I must say, cost me lots of hard earned money. I highly recommend these items to anyone who has an investment in their, toys of entertainment.
