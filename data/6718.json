How can I get excited about reviewing this product? I use it only as a power strip, since I have a dual-tuner DirecTV/TiVo and a Phillips LCD TV connected via component video. I understood what I was buying though, so I won't ding Monster for the item. It does its job and it does it well, but there are no bells and whistles on this thing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Hard to review a power strip", "unixReviewTime": 1126051200, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2005"}
