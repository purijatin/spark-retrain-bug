Super slim, it will fit under anything, the colored coded outlets are a plus in case you have several equipment connected (like me).3rd IT REALLY WORKS... last week there was an electrical storm were i live (Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) down here we don't really have grounded outlets so surge protectors a must, the point is that i have connected my HDTV, Home Theater, Xbox and Cable Box to the monster surge protector and only a speaker system is connected directly to the plug, to make the story short everything connected to the monster was ok but the speaker system and some other stuff in the house were damaged.BUY IT!!!... Great product... Excellent price!!I got 4 on my 2nd order!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Must have!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316390400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2011"}
