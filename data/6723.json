Morris", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "Replaced my ancient surge protector with this power strip that acts not only as a surge protector, but power conditioner.  Does it really work?  I have no idea.  My municipal utility has always delivered high quality power, so I have no idea if the power conditioning is adding any value.  Just a leap of faith on my part.  I can't notice any difference in my picture quality. I figure it can't hurt and can only help.I do like the ergonomic features.  Certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great! No more searching for the right plug.  I also like the fact that they provided 2 widely spaced plugs so wall-warts can fit.  Those design features are certainly worth a premium over your average power strip.UPDATE:  2 years after purchasing, the thing completely died on me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It works, I guess.", "unixReviewTime": 1204070400, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2008"}
