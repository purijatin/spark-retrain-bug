It has plenty of plugs for all the &#34;stuff&#34; associated with a TV, and several plugs that are spaced far enough apart to accommodate the &#34;wall warts.&#34;  Using this cable I was able to consolidate from 2 extension cables to one.  I am assuming the power is &#34;clean&#34; as it's advertised, as I've no way to check it.  Certainly a contender in this market.  Having the plugs labeled is a nice touch as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable Power Center", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2013"}
