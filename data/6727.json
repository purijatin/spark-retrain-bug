I have an LCD TV, PS3, Blu Ray player, cable box, and a receiver all plugged into this and it has given me no problems.  The outlets are clearly labeled, it even has 2 outlets that have extra space between them so you can plug items that use transformers in without covering other outlets.  It comes with a monster coax cable and a phone wire. Best of all is Monster Cable's lifetime warranty and coverage of up to $250,000 if the power strip fails to protect your electronics.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND PRICE", "unixReviewTime": 1298073600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2011"}
