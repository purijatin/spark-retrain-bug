I didn't need a power center and only bought it for the \"power cleaning\" or \"noise filtering\". I just finished upgrading my home theater...TV, AVR, and new sub. I came across an article in a Crutchfield catalog that listed this item as a good economy power filter and their test data showed that it worked well. So, for $27 I figured why not. I have no way of measuring before and after so I have no idea if it did anything for me. But again, Crutchfield said it works.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 stars based on price", "unixReviewTime": 1333670400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2012"}
