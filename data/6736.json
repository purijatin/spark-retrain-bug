Would I have actually bought it otherwise? Probably not.Sure, it's specs are impressive and it seems to be built well. I also like the fact that the outlets are spaced widely enough to plug in a wallwort power source or two.The \"problem\" with stuff like this is that, unless you have some way to test it, there's no way to tell if it's providing a cleaner throughput than just plugging your gear into a wall outlet.Now I certainly don't recommend not using a surge protector on expensive electronics. I have them on my main HT system, my bedroom HDTV and DVD player and my computer gear. It's certainly cheap insurance.Monster has been around for years and I've used some of their cables. I've often asked myself whether or not their extra cost is worth it. All I can answer is that Monster products provide me with a sense of security (falsely or otherwise) so I guess the peace of mind makes the $50 item worth more than the $10 item.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Guess That it Works", "unixReviewTime": 1202860800, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2008"}
