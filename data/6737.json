The POWER light is on, the Ground light is On and the Protection Enabled light is on, however only half of the surge protector has power (the half with only 2 outlets!).  No matter what I do, where I plug it in, or how many times I reset it, the second half of the surge protector does not power anything.I'm sure this product has potential, but mine did not function as expected.I'm in the process of returning it for a refund.-Ryan", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Dead on Arrival - don't know why", "unixReviewTime": 1269302400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2010"}
