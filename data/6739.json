This is a great all around power supply. It only has Monster's (over-marketed) Clean Power Stage 1, so don't think your system will look and sound *noticeably* better than before. And, I have no idea why they're still including a VCR plug on this - I haven't owned one of those in 7 years. Aside from these minor quibbles, I'd buy it again for the same setup.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good power supply but no noticeable audio/video improvement", "unixReviewTime": 1250035200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2009"}
