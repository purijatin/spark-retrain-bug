Some of the labels were not applicable to me so I had to just use an accessory plug, but everything seems to work.  I love the rocker switch.  I originall bought a Belkins Surge Protector with a Push Button switch.  I could not get the on and off switch to turn off so I returned it and bought this Monster Surge Protecter and I am pleased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Surge Protector - MP HT 5800", "unixReviewTime": 1328140800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2012"}
