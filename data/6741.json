Choden", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewtext": "Surge protection is not the only issue one need consider with respect to television, stereo, or computer hardware. AC power noise is another aspect to consider in order to maximize the quality and life of your investments. I found the Monster Cable PowerCenter a fine small investment for surge protection while also allowing a modest improvement in TV picture quality.UPDATE A YEAR+ LATER: The surge protector flat out went dead. No signs of power surge as others in the area were present and did not suddenly die. Overall, as typical with Monster products, overpriced and apparently not one that is long lasting.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Surge Protection and Power Noise Reduction", "unixReviewTime": 1170720000, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2007"}
