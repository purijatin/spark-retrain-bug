Unfortunately they didn't work properly.What has that got to do with the Monster Cable PowerCenter? Well the manufacturer of the chairs said that something one the electrical circuit for my chairs was causing the problem. Well guess what, it was. By running a 100 ft cord to another area in my home, I was able to solve the problem. That wasn't a good solution, so I tried the Monster Cable PowerCenter. It solved the problem.The same holds true with your remote controls, audio, video equipment and DVR. Yes a lot of the issue you maybe having are caused by dirty power. The Monster Cable provides clean power which makes everything work better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a cure for a lot of the problems you have with remotes devices, video and audio equipment", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}
