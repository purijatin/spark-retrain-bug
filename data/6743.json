Mathis \"alpha geek\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought the HTS800 as a replacement to the much more expensive HTS950 that started making terrible noises after 6 years of reliable use.  My primary need is to prevent my treadmill from interfering with my computer network.  Both units have \"Stage 1 Clean Power\" which I assumed meant RF filtering.  But while the HTS950 works to filter out the noise from the AC motor in my treadmill, the HTS800 does not.  It is not clear what type of filtering is needed, but the HTS800 does not have it.  I also tried the Tripp-Lite Isobar (did not work) and Monoprice Power Center which finally worked.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Doesn't Filter RF Interference", "unixReviewTime": 1383523200, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2013"}
