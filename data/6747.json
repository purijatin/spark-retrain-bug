All the wires and unorganized appearance of my TV was killing me on the inside.  The HTS 800 has allowed me to organize the wires, has enough for every plug and has tags that go on the cords themselves.  I am not sure about the cable stabilization when it comes to image quality as my TV and cable box and wiring is relatively new.  Overall, it is nice and hopefully will protect the equipment in case of power surge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Lightning Box Deal", "unixReviewTime": 1364688000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2013"}
