On the 30th of January 2008 suffered a massive surge, three surges in 2 seconds. The above surge protector saved my equipment! Also, it did not catch fire or explode. My Power Sentry 322 and every other protector in my house did pop loudly and/or shoot fire!I kissed the the Monster when I was able to restart my PC! Now buying this 800 and several other Monster Cable products.I'm sold for LIFE!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Massive Surge", "unixReviewTime": 1201910400, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2008"}
