I actually cut off the 'extension' connector and attached an IEC C13 RIGHT ANGLE POWER CORD CONNECTOR (also purchased on Amazon), to attach that to the sub. Love the cable. Very solid, thick and yet flexible. In my case, a perfect combination. Very happy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ver, good quality, thick yet flexible cable", "unixReviewTime": 1329955200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012"}
