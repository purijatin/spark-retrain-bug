The picture quality, while acceptable, did not impress me much. The blue color saturation was obvious. A reviewer at Amazon.com recommended the older Monster MV2CV component video cable and I ordered it (the player upconverts by component).Contrary to popular opinion that the cable does not matter it has made a difference in my case. The now much cheaper ($4.00) MV2CV) has given me a better picture with less blue color saturation, plus over all better picture quality than the DVD showed on the CRT TV. This is an excellent cable- well recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Cable Does Matter", "unixReviewTime": 1254700800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2009"}
