I was expecting a brighter/clearer image on my big screen that what I was getting with some $20 (other brand) cables.Guess what.  I haven't seen any improvement yet aside from the money that I am missing.  I tried these cables and the THX certified monster cables with no observable effects whatsoever.Perhaps there is a noticeble difference between these and the dinky cables included with most DVD players (but the same can be said for the $20 cables that I was using).", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Terrible price for no noticeable benefit over other decent component cables...", "unixReviewTime": 1198627200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2007"}
