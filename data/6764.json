So, I needed high quality componenet video cables. I got these, and it is hard to imagine better performance--even from HDMI. I run these cables from my DirecTV DVR to my AV Receiver. Another (longer) set runs from the Receiver to the wide-screen TV. The picture is sharp. I initially didn't get one of the connections pushed all the way onto the female end, and it didn't work. So, I pushed hard to get it on there, and it worked fine.  These are tight (that's a good thing, since you don't want loose connections). Just push hard to get them on good, and they will work great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top Quality for Analog Cables", "unixReviewTime": 1166054400, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2006"}
