And guess what, no difference. That's right. They rip you off. And what's the purpose off a gold plated connection if the rest of the signal passes through a copper cable.It irks me see the staff at BestBuy and Circuit City pitching Monster's $75 Component Cables and $120 HDMI cables at uneducated customers. There are cheaper and equally performing cables out there. Do your research and save some of your hard earned money.By the way, be wary of all the glowing reviews you read on amazon for this product or for others as well. Recently I have been seeing a lot of positive reviews from anonymous reviewers or reviewers with only one review to their name.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Monster Cables are a Rip Off", "unixReviewTime": 1189987200, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2007"}
