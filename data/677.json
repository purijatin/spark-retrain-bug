It does not follow the book exactly, but the substance is there. Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wholesome and Entertaining bit of Nostgalgia", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014"}
