Superior to composite & S Video. Monster classifies it as &quot;ultimate performance&quot;. I'd say only DVI & HDMI, which are both digital, are better. I needed a 2M or 6.5' cable because the 1M was just too short for my needs. I looked at this one (90$) and Monster's new THX Ulta 1000 4' component cable(100$). They had equal features. The THX cable is better looking than this one, however when it came down to it I didn't want to spend 10 extra bucks on a cable that's 2.5' shorter! Now this cable isn't THX certified, but it is certified by Imaging Science Foundation. I typically recommend Monster Cable, I feel they are the leader in A/V cables. This is a great fit for a progressive scan DVD player and/or HDTV. Get the most out of what you paid for!
