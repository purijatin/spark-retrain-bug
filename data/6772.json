Because I am a sucker for perfection, I went out and purchased them. Did I see a HUGE improvement in picture quality compared to another brand of component video cable I was using? No. At least not on my 27&quot; SONY WEGA tv. Okay, maybe the black levels are a bit better. I got these because I do believe better cables last a lot longer than cheaper-made ones. In addition, because I have so MANY cables running from my reciever, I figured cables with better jackets and good sheilding should cut back on video interference, producing better quality pictures.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "is it necessary?", "unixReviewTime": 988675200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2001"}
