Not only are the cables strong, they also transmit a really clean signal across them. I used the regular cables that came with the DVD player, and when I switched to the Monster S-Video Cable, the image quality improved alot and was very noticable on thier big screen TV.There is one thing I have to say, if you buy these cables, you should get them at Amazon.com since you will not find the cables for this low price anywhere. I paid (too much) for the ones I bought. I wish I had the foresight to get them at Amazon.com when I ordered the DVD player. So when you order these cables, make sure to order the other cables you need. Not only will your video be great, your sound will be too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great cables.", "unixReviewTime": 978048000, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2000"}
