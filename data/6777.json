Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it.~", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I am unable to verify its ultra high performance", "unixReviewTime": 1026950400, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2002"}
