The broad flat insulation around the wires plays havoc with a normal wire stripper, and if you were actually going to use all of the wire, there isn't nearly enough wall achors included with it to do the job. Being flat, it is very awkward and difficult to make a flat 90 degree turn, and the wire twists like a garden hose between anchors, instead of laying flat against the wall as it is supposed to.If you really want your speaker wire to not be seen, then it needs to be run up inside the wall into the attic and across and back down inside the other wall and wired to a speaker terminal. Otherwise, I think it's better to not pay so much, and just buy normal speaker wire that can be hidden along the baseboard under the carpet - or behind the floor wall trim, and alongside a door frame, etc.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not very easy to work with...", "unixReviewTime": 1243728000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2009"}
