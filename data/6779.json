The wire is pretty flat and I ran mine under the carpet.  Cutting it is a bit interesting as the flat shape does not cut with typical wire cutters and you pretty much have to trim with a knife around the wire, then twist it like normal.Overall I am happy with the purchase.  There is a small bump in the carpet (both by feel and visible), but I have a low pile carpet and not the best pad.  If you have thick pad and a medium to high pile carpet, I would think this wire would be barely noticeable under them.  Served its purpose and was easy to work with.  Thinner than regular wire of same gauge (a little).  I would recommend.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Wire", "unixReviewTime": 1373846400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2013"}
