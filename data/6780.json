I opted for these instead of the wire \"tape\" product since I wanted to avoid leaving tape residue on an existing wood floor.  They are detectable by touch (barefoot) beneath the carpet, but not by sight.  They more than satisfy my requirement to route rear channel surround sound speakers across a room in a town-home carpentry-free.The wires are easy to strip with a pinch-and-pull type (self-adjusting) wire stripper (Example:Irwin Industrial Tools 2078300 8-Inch Self-Adjusting Wire Stripper with ProTouch Grips).  Supplied connectors install easily, just remember to separate the leads into a long enough \"Y\" to allow the sleeves to pass out of the way of the connector during the crimping process.  I also bought some banana plugs to use in-case the supplied connectors didn't work, but they were too large for the flat wire/gauge combination.I am happy with the cables  and would buy them again in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy Install, Lay Flat, Invisible Under a Wool Rug", "unixReviewTime": 1330905600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2012"}
