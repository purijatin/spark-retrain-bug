Im glad that iI did get it cause as soon as i hooked them up to my Polks, I could instantly hear a solid diff!!!!! Some people might think as I did just not to long ago that wire doesn`t matter??? WEll it does more than u know!! So with that ui have to get this wire with some end clamps that are provided ,but I like my banana pins.But u cant go wrong here!!!! The wire is thick ,and bends easily. It has over 300 strands of pure copper in each wire!!!!Dont pass this MONSTER WIRE up if u want great performance out of any speaker,any brand....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Wire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1400544000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2014"}
