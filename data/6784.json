I've used Monster XP speaker wire in my home theater for many years, but this is the first time I had a need for flat wire. I was installing rear surround speakers using a Rocketfish wireless system and wanted minimal wire exposure.This very high quality wire and pins. Very easy to work with and it's vanilla or off white color makes it very unobtrusive. I would buy this again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very high quality speaker wire.", "unixReviewTime": 1363478400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2013"}
