It is a bit off white but it is paintable so will disappear once this room is repainted.  Others have had issues with the flat space between the two connection i think its perfect.  it allows for the perfect distance on the receiver end and keeps the conniption on the speaker in super net.  A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.
