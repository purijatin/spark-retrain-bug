I wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me, I often read in bed and with this it stands up some. I wish it were more adjustable. The reality is the way I use it you have two choices, flat, or slightly inclined. The way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright, that's not practical for my purposes. I am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires, this is very nice although I felt overpriced.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very nice case", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}
