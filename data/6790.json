I love the melt-into-the-wall off-white hue and the flat jacket lies almost flush against the wall. The wire is soft and pliable and easy to work with: bends around corners like a champ and is easy to cut and strip. Flat wire jackets might be tricky to strip with a cheap stripper--typical Rat Shack round hole strippers--but theIrwin Industrial Tools 2078300 8-Inch Self-Adjusting Wire Stripper with ProTouch Gripsmade short work of the flat jacket.The included pins are a bit too small for my taste. They really look like \"pins\" and were a struggle to squeeze this 16 gauge wire into. Surely more surface area is better for signal conductivity at the speaker and amp terminals. Also, the Amazon product photo shows banana plugs but the description says pins. I should have read the description more carefully. Luckily I have plenty of banana plugs, so I installed those instead. Finally, although the included wall anchors work great, Monster was really stingy with them as there isn't nearly enough for 50 feet.The SuperFlat sound and look great but I dinged them a star for the stingy terminal pins and wall anchors and the misleading product image.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality wire that blends with the wall!", "unixReviewTime": 1371859200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2013"}
