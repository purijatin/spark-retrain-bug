I just got my digital cable hooked up and the internet was not working correctly. The cable guy was about to disconnect the interent and put in a repair order becuase he said that I had a low signal in my place.  I recommended that he use one of these splitters instead of the one that he had from comcast and it improved the signal and got the internet working. He asked me where I got this from because he was going to start using these splitters.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable is correct", "unixReviewTime": 1207353600, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2008"}
