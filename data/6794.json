I had 3 tvs and two computers sharing the same cable signal, and in the bedrooms I was getting a lot of static on the tv at the upper range of channels.  Well I got tired of it, and the cable tech (over the phone) said they tested the pipe going into the apartment and it was fine, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.I went into the closet and found that they had used a really crummy low-end splitter, and after unscrewing the wall panel in my bedroom I found another one in there.Well, I bought two of these Monster splitters and immediately replaced them.  I am not going to say they fixed the problem, because they didn't, but they fixed it about 65%, which was enough to make the problem go away entirely in 2 of the rooms -just not in the 3rd one.If you are having problems with signal degradation it might be worthwhile to check if the splitters are part of the problem by buying one and testing it out.  It is a low cost, low hassle option, and you can ALWAYS use a splitter of your own somewhere.I have had good luck with Monster products...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I recommend this splitter", "unixReviewTime": 1172707200, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2007"}
