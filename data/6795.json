Some people may need ones that go above the 2Ghz but it all depends what you are using it for. For standard cable works great. For cable modem, digital cable or Sat TV, do research for your provider first and make sure it will be fine for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Little costy but worked good", "unixReviewTime": 1311292800, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2011"}
