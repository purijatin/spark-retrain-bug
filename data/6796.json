I see comments here from users who say they can't see a difference with this product; my comment to them is that they need a better tv. I also noted one reviewer who somehow heard that this splitter can't be used with CATV (It can, and I've been using mine for over a year with my digital cable hookup). Advantages: less noise and grain than others I've used, and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable company's \"free\" piece of junk. Most notably, this splitter maintains excellent image contrast and has no visible chroma effects that I can see. Few splitters can manage all this. The only product I've tried that might beat this is a $[...] job whose brand I don't remember (probably because I ain't spending $[...] on a splitter, for any reason). Even if you're not crazy about Monster in general, you'll get your money's worth here. I'm using two in my setup with a CELabs booster amp.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "One of few Monster products that's worth the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1193702400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2007"}
