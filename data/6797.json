That was fine.  When I called them back to add another connection (the cable was already run) they were apparently too lazy or too cheap to put in a 5-way splitter outside so they just tapped into an existing connection and installed a 2 way splitter in the attic.While I always had an OK picture on the 2 sets that were affected by this installation they were always a little fuzzy (especially on the lower channels) and would sometimes ghost for a few minutes.I bought the Monster splitter because it was a lot easier to try and change out the splitter that Cox installed than to replace the splitter outside. OK, it wasn't easier, but it was cheaper.I'm happy to say that it worked great.  I compared the picture on those 2 sets to one that's fed directly from the box outside and there isn't any difference in the picture.This thing works.
