Coronel", "helpful": [0, 2], "reviewtext": "The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "screw holes don't align", "unixReviewTime": 1355702400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2012"}
