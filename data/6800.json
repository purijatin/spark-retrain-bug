Wyatt \"ssintrepid\"", "helpful": [52, 59], "reviewtext": "After making some recent upgrades in my primary audio/video system it became clear that the two way splitter that the cable company provided was simply inadequate to the task.  Upon doing some research I determined that this particular splitter made by one of the industries most reputable manufacturers was going to have to be the way to go.  Upon hooking up this superior two-way splitter in conjunction with Monster's MV3F2M NF Video 3 coaxial cables there was quite a wonderfully distinct difference in the picture on my new television.After seeing such a distinct improvement in the signal for my primary audio/video system I immediately went out and purchased another one for the computer room to use for both the cable modem and the television in that room.  This is the perfect two-way splitter for either a television/cable modem hookup or a television with PIP (picture-in-picture) capability in conjunction with a cable box or satellite receiver!I highly recommend this outstanding cable splitter to any and all who're interested in getting the best picture available from their television sets or signal for their cable modems.  The end results far outweigh the costs for this splitter!  {ssintrepid}", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable TGHZ-2RF - The perfect cable splitter!", "unixReviewTime": 1076716800, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2004"}
