When we looked at what they had to offer my boyfriend figured then and there that it wasn't going to work but we bought it anyway for $[...], needless to say, he was right. It didn't work, not even a little bit. I searched on Amazon.com for the splitter I needed and due to the high recommendations I read on the site I ordered two of the Monster Cables and they're working great. Since then when I go to any electronics store I haven't seen any splitters quite like these so I would highly recommend using the Monster Cable TGHZ-2RF (Two Gigahertz Low-Loss RF Splitters For TV & Satellite 2-Way 2 Gigahertz) especially for your satellite - you can't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Monster Cable TGHZ-2RF Two Gigahertz  - It's GREAT!", "unixReviewTime": 1206144000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2008"}
