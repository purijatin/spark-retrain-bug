Choden", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewtext": "What the cable companies provide in 1Ghz cheapo coaxial splitters is insufficient to get the best TV picture quality, particularly if one has several coaxial cable connections relating to TV's and broadband internet. I found in using the increased bandwidth of the Monster splitters of 2Ghz having improved the sharpness of analog and digital cable TV reception. Additionally, as more people are opting for HDTV sets and broadband internet connectivity, reducing signal loss will provide one potential improvement relating to multiple connections. Other issues relate to dirty AC power interference and the quality of the cabling used, (such as superior performance in S-Video or composite cables), so the solution to maximize your signal quality is multifaceted. It is recommended to use either the 2 or 3 splitter variation. The 4-splitter model has more signal loss. Use the splitters at the entry point and where one splits coax between the TV and other components such as DVD/DVR's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Improve your signal quality for TV and broadband.", "unixReviewTime": 1170720000, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2007"}
