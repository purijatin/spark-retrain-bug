It lowers the signal strength a lot, exposes the signal to interference, and creates a failure point.  There isn't much you can do if you need a split, though, other than doing it as well as you possibly can.This is a very heavy duty splitter.  It has high gauge lines, and a well-sealed outer grounded shell to keep out interference.  While it is true that standard cable signals do not go over (or even approach) one gigahertz, I like that this one is designed to handle the much more difficult to protect two gigahertz signals that are used in DSS satellite dishes.  Frequencies that high are difficult to keep from leaking out, so if it can handle those I know I don't have to worry about the lower cable frequencies leaking out either.Overkill for most, but cheap insurance to help protect a common source of noise and interference.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The thousand-pound gorilla of splitters", "unixReviewTime": 1198368000, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2007"}
