I have a TV tuner in my computer  that has the cable signal passing through FOUR of these Monster Cable 2Ghz  splitters, and there is virtually no signal degradation, most notably on  the troublesome lower band channels like 2 and 3.The reception on our  big-screen TV is the best it has ever been, too, using this splitter and  the high-quality MC coax cable._Before_ I installed these MC splitters,  I was using the best gold-plated splitters available from one of your  favorite national electronic parts suppliers around the corner, and the  signal for channels 2 and 3 was basically dead on arrival with extremely  snowy picture and noisy sound interference.Great job, Monster Cable!  You've done it again by proving that nothing else compares.  Thank you!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Phenomenal!", "unixReviewTime": 965692800, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2000"}
