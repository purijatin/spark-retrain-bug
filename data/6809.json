Of course, my cable connection was already split with the one TV and the modem; I was worried that adding the second TV would slow down my cable modem connection--happily, my worries were for naught.The splitter was easy to install, and within no time, I had 2 TVs with great reception AND a blazing fast internet connection.  I even have a router and it all works well together.  I am delighted with this product and would recommend it to anyone who has limited cable connections and does not mind having a cable running from one room to another.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Did exactly what I hoped it would do", "unixReviewTime": 1152403200, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2006"}
