The main difference in splitters is in the accuracy of the internal construction, whether or not a circuit board is used, and the quality of the shielding box construction and the transformer core material.However, there is one thing to remember, and it's a biggie: if you have Digital Cable, the subtleties of rendition in either video or audio are virtually *independent* of the quality of the box. Normal cable is \"analog\"... if you have interference or a weak signal, you get bars, snow, crackly sound, either all the time or periodically. Maybe your poor quality splitter needs to be replaced. With digital cable, you either \"get it\" or \"you don't\". When you have weak signal, you will have horribly choppy, blocky looking video (or none at all); same goes for the audio. If everything is working OK, upgrading your splitter won't incrementally improve your audio or video quality. In fact, nothing will, except perhaps a new TV or a better Set Top Box with better output circuitry behind the digital-to-analog decode stage.Adding an expensive, overpriced splitter with gold plated hoohaws may stave off corrosion 5 years down the line, but so will a thin layer of silicon grease. It certainly won't give you \"smoother sonic performance\" or any of those \"subtle\" differences that they claim are \"worth it.\"Just so you know....", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Probably overpriced; promised benefits are illusory if you have digital cable", "unixReviewTime": 1190073600, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2007"}
