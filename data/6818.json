Thompson \"A/V Geek\"", "helpful": [13, 17], "reviewtext": "Previously Adelphia had setup my cable using two daisy chained 2 way splitters.  This caused my HD signals to drop very frequently, especially on HBO.  It was so bad that I couldn't watch the HD feed at all.  I was told that this would not solve my problem from a local high end A/V store, but they were dead wrong.  Once I replaced the 2 splitters with 1 4-way splitter my signal was perfect.  In fact, the reception on the analog stations also improved dramatically.  To ensure the best signal I have also added other hardware: 1 Motorola Drop amp, 1 Monster 4 way loss loss splitter, then a Monster PowerCenter HTS 2100 with video filtering.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solved my problems", "unixReviewTime": 1096848000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2004"}
