I got this months ago to fix some loss issues.  Saw this shiny think with overpriced tag, and thought it will resolve the issue.  After using this the HD was creating problems, TVs in my other rooms were having huge issues with signal.  Finally went back to comcast's splitter and all was well.  They recommended not to use this.  I totally agree.  Nice gold plating though.  Can be in a display cabinet.  Not just this monster product, but so many of their products are simply overpriced when compared to the same quality (in some cases average than normal quality).", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Shiny Junk", "unixReviewTime": 1297900800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2011"}
