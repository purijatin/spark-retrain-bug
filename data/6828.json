And as a digital media, naturally buying the cheapest MD has its appeal, because as long as the media works at all, it's going to sound the same.However it might not be worth getting this brand.  I keep pretty good care of the MD's, but of the 40 I bought when I first got into Minidiscs, 4 or 5 have had problems where the metal slide either comes off in my pocket, or sticks open.  I've been able to get them back on right, but I've made concert recordings that I'd *hate* to lose, I'd prefer the problem didn't come up at all.  I haven't had a problem with one coming off in the player, and I don't think that'll happen, but you hate to take chances with an expensive player...So it might be worth getting these MD's if they're at the right price, and if you can stand to lose what you've recorded to the MD.  Still, I've taken to buying Sony multi-packs, and using the remaining blank Memorex MD's only sparingly.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Problematic", "unixReviewTime": 1026345600, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2002"}
