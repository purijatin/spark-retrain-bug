But after, I tested the first delivery, I was so excited about it, and decided to order another set of 40 discs.I use them every day for recording lectures at my college using LP4 mode in my Sony MZ-R700. A also use 5 Sony colored MD74 discs, and I noticed some jitter with them, which did not happen with my Memorex discs.I think, Memorex is a great deal for those, who are independent in mind from the brand and is more concentrated on the quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's a high quality and affordable deal!", "unixReviewTime": 1040169600, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2002"}
