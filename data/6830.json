They serve their purpose. The colors are cool, but need individual boxes. That way, they'll be more compact. I've seen my discs fall out of the flimsy dust free case.So far there are no problems with the discs themselves. It's great that you can record about 1000X on them. At least if one breaks, it doesn't cost a lot to replace them. They're less than...each.Actually, my discs say there's 75 minutes of recording time. Well, I can't say much more. If you like Memorex products, get these cool little discs.Did my review help you?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice discs, awkward boxes", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
