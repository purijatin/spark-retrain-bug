I  haven't recorded on them all yet, but so far 6 of them are messed  up--either they appear to record correctly and then can't be played, or  they won't even start recording.  They seem like a good value, but if you  take out the 6 that have failed (so far) I'm paying the same amount for  these as other discs, and these don't come without cases.  I give them 1  star because zero stars isn't an option!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Stay away from these!!", "unixReviewTime": 966729600, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2000"}
