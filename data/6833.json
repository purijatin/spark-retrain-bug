And here's my gripe. Petty as it may sound, the labels keep peeling up. At first it's a minor annoyance, but when the things get stuck in the player because of the label, that's just silly. I've actually gone to the length of using labels from other mini discs. It all sounds stupid yes? But why pay money for something that displeases you? I switched to TDK, and they're a better value, and- the labels stay put!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Mini discs are mini discs.", "unixReviewTime": 988848000, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2001"}
