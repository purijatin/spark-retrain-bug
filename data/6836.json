While browsing and email work fine, I like to be able to ping from DOS, and this port is blocked for some reason. If you have Windows 98 Second Edition, I would only install the driver, then set up file and print sharing manually and use ICS (which comes with Windows 95 Second Edition) to share your Internet connection. But I LOVE the cards themselves! Get a Linksys BEFSR41 Router and a Linksys HomeLink Broadband Bridge, and you won't need to use a PC at all in order to share your Internet connection!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good card, adequate software", "unixReviewTime": 971049600, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2000"}
