This device works AS ADVERTISED.  In fact, I was only running a 10 Mbps thinnet network in my home before, and my new HPNA network (made of 3 of these cards) marginally outperforms the coax.  Over telephone wire!  Without interfering with the phone (or vice versa)!  Wow!  WOW!This is a great time we live in.A note:  If you're a novice with networking, I don't know how well the included networking software works.  As I said, I'm very familiar with networking, so I just installed the drivers and configured Windows' built-in networking myself.  If you know what you're doing, however, this is a definitely a GREAT product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 988588800, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2001"}
