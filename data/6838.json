The card physically is very easy to install, provided you have an empty PCI slot (if not, then use PA-101 USB adapter). One computer runs W98SE, and the second runs ME. The driver CD works fine, even better with ME since driver installs automatically. It plugs into any working phone jack, and you're all networked and ready to surf the net. Everything needed is included in the package. You can be on line and still use your phone without any degradation in either signal. The 10X connection is quite fast and not noticeably different than your 10/100 wired ethernet connection. I have a broadband cable modem, hooked to my router. One of my router's LAN ports is hooked a phoneline bridge (Netgear PE102, another great product), and the bridge to a phone jack. I definitely recommend this card, with a bridge, if you want to set up a home phoneline network.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product", "unixReviewTime": 1048377600, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2003"}
