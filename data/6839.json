I believe this may be the cause of many people's woes...I run these cards on 3 very different systems: 1) AMD athlon 1ghz biostar mb 2) Intel p90 \"Micron\" who knows what kind of mb 3) Intel p133 \"Gateway\" ditto on the mbBut, for all three, I am running windows 98se (second edition).I believe the determining factor in getting your PC's to talk to each other using this device and provided drivers is having the same operating system on each platform.As I recall, during software installation for the Netgear cards, I was required to \"insert the windows installation CD\" for the complete software installation. As the Netgear software relies on windows networking software this is key to getting these things working. There are a lot of differences between windows95, windows98, and windowsME, especially in the area of networking.Netgear's installation should overcome these differences, or at least document the problems. For this I am downgrading my rating to only 2 stars...", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "4 Months and still running", "unixReviewTime": 988329600, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2001"}
