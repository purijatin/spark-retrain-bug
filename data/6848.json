I know it is a combination of compression and format, but I never really did the math.GREAT PRICE: I bought this card, number one, because the price was great. Now the price is even greater when you get it for about 2MB for $1.NUMBER OF PICTURES THAT CAN BE STORED:155 in a DC240 with 1MP.55 in a DX3900 with 3.1 MP.I never knew the MP versus MB formula, this practical application helped me out. I understand however, much depends on your compression and format. This was all .jpg files and on Kodak cameras.SEEMS COMPATIBLE FOR PDA AND PC:I know one of the concerns on these cards is compatibility.  Since I have had it, I have put it in an @migo Pocket PC, on the PCMCIA card on an IBM laptop and a Kodak DX3600 and a HP315.  It worked great.Nice card and a nice size, I'm set for awhile now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "64MB card - 155 pictures for a 1MP Kodak DC240 camera", "unixReviewTime": 993254400, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2001"}
