Bruner", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I've used Viking components in the past and never had any negative experiences with their products.  When I got a digital camera, I shopped the local computer and mall stores for Compact Flash memory cards before turning to Amazon.com.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an affordable Compact Flash card in the capacity I was looking for made by Viking.  The card works great with my Kodak digital camera and Sandisk CF reader.  A top notch product at an affordable price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value and good performance", "unixReviewTime": 1013472000, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2002"}
