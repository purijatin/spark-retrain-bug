I fished it out of the camera, saw it was completely soaked. So hoping for the best I dried it with the hotel hair dryer (on cool) as it had all my Disney vacation pics on it..and I could not bear to throw it away without checking. Wonder of wonders it still worked though my Canon A70 camera had no such luck, and I was able to download all my photos. I am still using it everyday since then in my new Canon camera as I am an avid photographer. I take about 30-40 pictures a day and delete them at the end of the day once I download them onto my computer. I am quite happy with it as even with a 4 MP camera on high resolution it gives me enough memory for about a 100 photos and since I download frequently to my laptop even when on vacation I have never needed more. All in all great value for money!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value for money!", "unixReviewTime": 1085788800, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2004"}
