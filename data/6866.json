This is a good value.Keep in mind, though, unlike the cheaper versions of this card, this card does NOT come with a flash reader.  I was disappointed to find this out, but it was my own fault for just assuming it did.  I still give it 5 stars.[A note to HP Jornada 548 customers.  This card works fine with the Jornada Pocket PC.  I say this because it is not mentioned in the advertisement that the 128MB version is compatible, but it is.]One nice thing about this card is that there is 24/7 tech support available if something should go wrong with it (or with installation or whatever), but I don't know what could really go wrong with it --I guess that's why they offer the tech support!Anyone using MP3s should REALLY go for this card and skip the 64 MB card.  The 64 MB card would be rather skimpy, and with 128 MB you'll ALWAYS find things to store on it.  (I've had my card three days now and I've filled up 50 MB already, downloading songs, books, and maps).One nice thing about having a flash card for a PocketPC (or other handheld) is that you can back up your entire regular memory onto your flashcard easily, without having to worry about memory failure.  That is pretty neat, kind of like a second hard drive for your computer...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A VERY good value! Don't bother with a smaller card for MP3s", "unixReviewTime": 975801600, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2000"}
