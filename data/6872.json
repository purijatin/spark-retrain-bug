Surkan", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "This seems like an excellent value for the money, but it is not quite as good as it seems. After receiving it, I learned that it only has 120MB of space on it. Perhaps they are cheap because they had some defects that make 8MB or so unusable.It works fine. I would just divide the price by 120MB instead of 128 to find the true value.I would also highly recommend using the Viking PCMCIA card reader for CompactFlash. It simply shows up as another drive in Windows with NO DRIVER SOFTWARE to load. You might get a deal by buying the memory and card reader together.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value for money. Not 128MB", "unixReviewTime": 997056000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2001"}
