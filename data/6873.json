Stores 50 or so raw images.  Downloads are fast and haven't had a single reliability issue.  I like compactflash cards as they are much more sturdier and Viking Components did well on this one.I recommend this card for anyone who has a digital comera that takes compactflash cards", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "have had this card for 2+ yrs now and no problems", "unixReviewTime": 1074643200, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2004"}
