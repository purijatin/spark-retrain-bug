I did not notice any differences between this card and my Kodak CF card in terms of speed of transfers, previewing pictures on the camera, or reading from a card reader.As noted, the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within 15 days of the purchase date.  If you get super saver shipping, you're really cutting it close.  I did not make the deadline since I put it off a few days.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great, snappy transfers, watch out for rebate deadline", "unixReviewTime": 1048032000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2003"}
