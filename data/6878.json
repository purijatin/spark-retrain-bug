Maybe Viking is using the same calculation as in other storage devices like HDD?  Anyway, on my new Canon PowerShot G2, it can store 42 RAW images.  It is not bad.  Remember to calculate the price/MB ratio:  It is very close to 340MB microdrive.  Moreover, solid state device (RAM) is always faster than mechincal devices (HDD) and draw less power.  I personally choose this because the price and performance is right.  Other sizes (64MB, 256MB, or microdrives from IBM etc.) are not as good as this... as of today, of course (10/23/01)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Price/MB ratio", "unixReviewTime": 1003881600, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2001"}
