This means two things: 1) lower cost (to Viking), and 2) compatibility with devices may not be as robust as Lexar or Sandisk.  There have been numerous reports about incompatibility between Viking flash memory and various digital cameras and PDAs.  You should do a web search before buying this product.That said, this Viking CF card should work in most digital cameras or older Pocket PCs that take CF.  The rated speed of 8x means this is not suitable for digital SLR's such as the Nikon D70 or Canon EOS Digital Rebel which need higher-speed CF cards (40x or higher).  Most consumer, non-SLR digital cameras will find the speed of this card more than adequate.  128MB holds about 80-100 5MP, high-quality pictures (depending on the complexity of each picture and the particular camera model).  I personally recommend if you have a 4MP or more camera, you should have a 256MB memory card as your primary card, while carrying a 128MB card like this Viking as a spare.In short, this Viking 128MB CF card is good for the money.  Just make sure it's compatible with your digital camera.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good value, but watch out for compatibility", "unixReviewTime": 1104796800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2005"}
