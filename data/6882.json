With my Viking 128 MB compact flash card, I can store 212 digital photos at high resolution! Compact Flash memory is often $1 per MB, but this was much less (including the rebate from Viking, which I got as promised).  Overall, a good deal for a good product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Deal.", "unixReviewTime": 1008201600, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2001"}
