The high-resolution images are memory hogs, so I bought this card to augment the 16 MB card that came with it.  The card works just as well as my kodak card--no noticeable performance differences whatsoever.  AND, this card costs WAY less than similar offering directly from Kodak or other providers.  I love Kodak, but not enough to spend twice as much money for their product!Oh, and Amazon.com has the best price for this that I have seen.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Value", "unixReviewTime": 984355200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2001"}
