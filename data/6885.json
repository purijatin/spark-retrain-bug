Decelles", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "I got a Canon A40 for Christmas, and is came with a small 8MB Canon CF card to store pictures on.  At high resolution (its a 2.0MP camera) I could store 11 pictures.  With this card I was able to stores nearly 200.I don't know about you, but I don't take 200 pictures in a week, not even in two weeks usually.  Even when I go on vacation.  This card provides more than enough storage for pictures or small movies taken with your digital camera, and if you buy a CF Card reader, its a great way to back up your files when re-installing Windows, or just when transfering files from a PC to a Mac.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This card is just perfect!", "unixReviewTime": 1048032000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2003"}
