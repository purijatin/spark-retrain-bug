Occasionally every couple of months, my camera (Nikon Coolpix 3200) will give me a message saying there is a problem with the card, but when I turn my camera off and on, everything is fine and no data is lost. I don't know how common this problem is, but since it is occasional, it is not worth it to me to get a new card. I enjoy the extra memory this card provides; just enough for an amateur photographer.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Card", "unixReviewTime": 1172016000, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2007"}
