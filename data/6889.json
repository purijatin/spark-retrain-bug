I needed ONE more flash card so I could stop juggling the flash cards I already have between devices every few days... (Kodak DC4800 camera, HP Handheld computer, DC50, etc.)Especially when traveling, I take LOTS of pictures and adding this card to my electronics arsenal means I can snap longer before downloading onto my 6-gigabyte digital wallet storage device.  Shooting highest-resolution pics is less trouble with this high-capacity card when compared to smaller-capacity ones since this card doesn't fill-up so quickly. And storing files (images, audio, documents, etc.) for my handheld computer is easier and more fun, too.And this card is NOT SLOWER than others I have. My devices seem to read/write to this card at the same speed as my other CF cards.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SUPERB value", "unixReviewTime": 981158400, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2001"}
