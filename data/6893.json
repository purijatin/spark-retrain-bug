It takes microdrive, but when I asked around, I heard that they had some reliability problems.  So I went with the largest memory I could buy.  The camera itself came with 16Mb, and I have another 48Mb in cards from a previous digital - so altogether I can take over a thousand pictures at very high resolution.  Now I need a Digital Wallet for those long trips without a laptop - perfect combo.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hundreds of pictures - in a single card", "unixReviewTime": 984873600, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2001"}
