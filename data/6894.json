I can take up to 300 pictures on one card with my Nikon Coolpix 995 but usually use higher resolution and get 150 pictures.  I have two cards and they last for even long vacations (plus, you can use the National Geographic approach when using this card -- take 300 pictures to get 30 good ones!).Also, the rebate (when it was offered) worked just fine for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great with Nikon Coolpix", "unixReviewTime": 1006646400, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2001"}
