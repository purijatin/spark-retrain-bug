Mountford", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "If you can get only one add-on for your digital camera, let it be this one.I took my Kodak digital camera decked out with this 128MB CompactFlash card on a 6-week road trip.  I used the &quot;middle&quot; quality setting for the pictures, and managed to take over 130 photos (the equivalent of 5-6 24-shot rolls of film), filling not anywhere close to half the card (at that setting, the card will store over 300 photos)!I'm not a digital photography technoid by any stretch of the imagination -- I just like capturing memories of the places I go and the things I see.  Having the extra memory afforded by this little card meant that I could relax and not worry about running out of space for all my photos.Transferring the photos to my laptop was a piece of cake, and took very little time -- partially a function of the card.I highly recommend this as the *first* accessory/upgrade you purchase for your camera!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great addition for your digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 1007596800, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2001"}
