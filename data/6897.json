I bought this with my S200 Elph because I knew the included 8meg card wouldn't be large enough.  It's transfer speed does talk a second or two, but its not long enough to make me irratated.  Also, the two sides of the card are very different, so I can tell which side goes up.  The card also looks very cool, very shiny.  Before you buy this one, however, make sure that its the kind of card your camera/MP3 player/etc. takes, so you don't end up like the reviewer who said your MP3 player would need to be the size of a boombox to use this card.  Another plus is that this is the cheapest 128meg card I have seen on Amazon.com.  For a great value for a 128meg card, definately buy this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Card", "unixReviewTime": 1029888000, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2002"}
