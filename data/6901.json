In my opinion, you really have two good alternatives. (1) a good capacity compactflash memory card like this Viking card, or (2) one of the microdrives.This 128 mb Viking memory card is a good value on a cost per megabyte basis (I have not seen a better compactflash value anywhere), and it offers more peace of mind since it has no moving parts. However, the microdrive does cost less per megabyte (in fact, for the same cost you'll get 340 mb of storage vs. 128 mb with the Viking), although you'll have a miniature hard drive to worry about in terms of potential lost photos.I've got both, but I'll only use the microdrive on long trips where I know I'll need the storage space. And then I'mn exceptionally careful with it. Most people will be happier going the compactflash route, in which case this Viking card is the best value and very reliable. I'm very pleased with it. Go ahead, it's pretty much an essential accessory.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Buy this or a microdrive", "unixReviewTime": 973209600, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2000"}
