The Vikings 128 mb flashcard is great.  At Xmas I took 52 pictures and still had 167 pictures available to take on the card.  I recommend this card to anyone who, like myself loves to take pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic CompactFlash Card", "unixReviewTime": 1009411200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2001"}
