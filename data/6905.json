(but this is a matter of miliseconds) reliability, I have had the two other cards for about 6 months and have not had a problem with data loss of any kind. On my 2 megapixel camera, the Viking 128mb CF card shot about 360-400 images \"high quality\" (depending on image size, each image can be a different file size, depending on the information each one requires)So, I would just stick with a big name like Viking or Sandisk and you really cant go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good solid card/brand", "unixReviewTime": 1044835200, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2003"}
