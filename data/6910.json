The card works seemlesly and stores about 125 pictures at maximum 2.1 megapixel resolution. The cost can't be beat,... A nice addition if you have a laptop is a PCMCIA Viking adapter which allows you to plug the compact flash card directly into the computer and use it as a drive. This setup is much faster than any USB download or compactflash card reader and is ideal for digital images.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent value.", "unixReviewTime": 994032000, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2001"}
