I can take so many pictures with my new camera! If I would not have purchased this, I would have been disappointed with the fact that I can only take 15 pictures with my 8 MB card. With this card on the best resolution, I can take 250 pictures! You definitely need something like this if you really want to take advantage of your digital camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must have!", "unixReviewTime": 1032307200, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2002"}
