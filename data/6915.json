This 128MB card is a great value for the money (especially with the rebates). Transfer times are what you'd expect, there's nothing that makes this stand out of the crowd other than the price. But just make sure you're aware of the space capacity you'll really be needing - it just isn't roomy enough to keep up with any cameras over 4MP. However, it's a solid and dependable backup that I always have with me whenever I'm out shooting with my 5MP camera.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A digital photographer's plan B", "unixReviewTime": 1074124800, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2004"}
