It works very well, this is my third, the oldest one is almost 3 years and working with no problems.  An added bonus is it comes in a little plactic box which makes it safer for storage in the camera bag.  The rabate makes it very inexpensive too!I also have the Viking card reader for a laptop, was only $9 and makes transfering pictures to computer no effort at all!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1059177600, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2003"}
