They are very tiny and slip in to your digital camera and PDAs. This latest one with 128 Mega Bytes is awesome and it works great with the Hewlett Packard C315 Camera. It stores over a 300 high quality images from your camera.However I believe that a lot of Olympus Digital Camera's dont use the compact flash cards but instead use the SMART MEDIA card which is slightly bigger than the compact flash card. So make sure this card is for the right device.This card fits inside the digital printers that print photographs. Great Card, good speed , I'd recommend it to anyone.......and hey good price on it too !!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good card", "unixReviewTime": 993686400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2001"}
