I have not had any problems with it, it was fairly cheap, and the speed seems to be fine.  I reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at 30 FPS, because since this isn't a high speed card, when I tried to record at that quality and resolution, I only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow.  Other than that, I like this card and reccomend it", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Card", "unixReviewTime": 1094169600, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2004"}
