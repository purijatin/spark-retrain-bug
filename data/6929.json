Smith \"Aarowsmith\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I don't know what the fuss is about with buying only SVHS tape for your SVHS video recorder or ADAT machine.This tape performs better than most SVHS tape and it is only VHS rating. But You don't have to modify this TDK tape case at all, none, no modification at all to play it in any SVHS machines or ADAT machine. It will work just like SVHS tape. I do not know what people are talking about drilling a hole in the case do not do it !!! It is non sense, I tested this tape and it records perfectly in SVHS mode in any SVHS machine and any ADAT period.In fact all Super High Grade VHS tape will play and record just fine in any SVHS machine, so you can also use other Super High Grade VHS tapes from other good brands as well.First thing I noticed is this TDK tape is the finest smoothest highest quality highest density magnetic particle tape you can buy for your VHS machine, ADAT, or any SVHS machine. And it will not clog up your heads unlike cheap VHS tape or cheap SVHS tape like Quantegy. Stay away from Quantegy SVHS or VHS tape, this tape will clog your rotary heads and you will have drop outs in your ADAT and SVHS machine, definately not for Masters !!!Like I said this tape is better quality than most Super High Grade SVHS tape on the market, so you can not go wrong with this VHS tape, so please go pick some up today, if you can before the complete supply runs out. I do not know if TDK still makes this tape anymore ? Does Anyone have that answer ???", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Alesis ADAT SVHS quality without SVHS rating", "unixReviewTime": 1263600000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2010"}
