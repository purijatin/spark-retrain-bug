Sherwin", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewtext": "TDK manufactures excellent, extra high grade six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The extra high grade of this blank VCR tape ensures that you get longer life out of these blank tapes. Moreover, if you record a special event on these for a permanent video recording the quality of the video on the tape will outshine the quality of the video on the regular version of this VCR tape. Things should look \"sharper\" and be a little bit more in focus, too.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable, blank extra high grade VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK extra high grade six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "all right by me !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1199750400, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2008"}
