The Olympus takes 4 AA batteries.  I thought I would need a 2nd set of batteries but the first set lasted the whole trip.Great for vacations when you don't want to lug around a charger and a spare set of batteries, however if you take a lot of pictures with your digital camera, it might be wise to invest in two sets of rechargable NiMH batteries and a portable charger.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good enough for vacation photos", "unixReviewTime": 1008288000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2001"}
