You can even get software downloads from Garmin's web site.  There are many accessories available, and you will probably want them all!  The complete outfit is kind of pricey.  If you want to upload maps you will need a separate data card, you cannot load maps into the stock unit.  Also, it eats a TON of batteries!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Fantastic!", "unixReviewTime": 1034726400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2002"}
