With the 8 Meg of RAM, I am able to  download the areas covering the Appalachian Trail from West Virginia to the  Southern end in Virgnia. That takes about 4 Meg--plenty of room for other  regions as well. Because GPS signals are so weak, the antenna needs to be  exposed to the sky to keep a good signal. The flat back of the eMap makes a  strip of velcro easy to apply to allow mounting of the unit on the shoulder  strap of a backpack. The features aren't as numerous as the Garmin III+,  but it covers all the basics and provides a large, crisp screen. I haven't  tried the dash mount for my truck, but it looks like it would do well in  that environment as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun Gadget", "unixReviewTime": 966211200, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2000"}
