I purchased the dashboard mount and the 12volt cord to go with the E-Map. The base map includes almost all of the major and not-so-major roads in my area so I've not yet upgraded to the Metro CD. The base map has suited my purposes well. I especially like the E-Map's ability to give directional driving information to specific map points (can be waypoints or points entered on the base map). The E-Map gives vehicle speed in MPH, a trip odometer, and will give you time-to-waypoint information based on speed and distance. All very fun to use on trips. E-Map also has exit info (food, fuel, lodging) but I've not yet used that much.The E-Map can be a bit tedious -- entering waypoint info and place names can be difficult using the small paddle switch. Warmup takes a few minutes cold but reacquiring your location is very quick. I have had no trouble maintaining satellite reception with the unit on the dashboard of my two cars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "E-Map in the car", "unixReviewTime": 969926400, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2000"}
