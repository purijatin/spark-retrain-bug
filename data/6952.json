This prompted me to invest some money into a gps system. Frankly the sole reason i chose this piece was the relative low price, however, i now think it was money well invested. There are however some cons to the gadget which one should keep in mind. First of all if you are driving alone then its kind of hard to keep an eye on the thing and drive as well. Also you should have a memory cartridge and the mapsource cd rom for fuller and detailed view of the area, the base map is not as good as it becomes once the map is downloaded off the cd rom (which means more money gone into it). Most of its features are good, however, `goto` would mark a path which is a straight line and not always the best one. So overall i would say that its a good one, but beware of the additional investments.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a nice one", "unixReviewTime": 981936000, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2001"}
