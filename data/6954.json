Another cool thing that pilots will appreciate, is the ability to immediately know your groundspeed (quickly accounting for headwind and tailwind components) which you would normally need to tediously calculate times between waypoints on your E6B.  It even gives you a running update on when you will reach your waypoints/destination.  Love a handheld GPS when a tower (at an airport that I am not familiar with) asks me to report at 3 or 4 miles/whatever because I can give them a report call at exactly (or nearly so) the distance that they specify, rather than 'eyeball' the distance and give an approximate guess (important when there is no DME at/near the airport).Best part, is that it has most of the essential functions a private pilot would like, WITHOUT the high cost of some of those 'aviation' handhelds.What I would recommend is to also buy a remote antenna (Garmin Part #GA 27C) it comes with 8 ft of cable and an antenna that mounts with a suction cup holder on any smooth surface.  This is something that I am having to buy now.  The GPS works fine without it,,,, it is just that having the antenna increases your placement options in your plane.Good Flights!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Garmin eMap GPS for pilots?", "unixReviewTime": 979171200, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2001"}
