Lauterbach \"chadl2\"", "helpful": [13, 14], "reviewtext": "The primary use for my GPS is city driving, and in LA it is a huge help.  To use this unit for city driving you must also purchase the MetroGuide USA CD's.  These CD's can upload data to the eMap.  This data includes addresses, businesses, and surface streets.  I also have the external antenna for my car, and I find this helps a lot when the unit is in the car.  It should be noted that it can not actually plan a route for you, but you can use the map to determine your route.  Also, it tells you how far away from your destination you are, and aproximately how long it will take you to get there.  I have set waypoints all over the city so that I can always find my way.  I can also punch an address in and it will show me right where that point is.  I never get lost anymore.  Many people also use this unit for hiking, or camping, and I have used it for this a couple times as well, and have found it very useful.  I have also taked it in the airplane and it is a kick to see where you are, and how fast you are going.  I have used a number of other units and find this one to be the most versatile, and great all around.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GPS for City Driving", "unixReviewTime": 974073600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2000"}
