The Garmin EMAP deluxe does exactly for that purpose, and does it extremely well!First of all, if you want to find specific addresses, you need to get the metroguide CD and download detail map info into your GPS.  Otherwise, all you get is major roadways and highways.  You won't get lost, but if the house you're looking for is located on some local road, you won't find it.  You need a data cartridge to hold the detail maps.  The emap deluxe comes with an 8 mb cartridge.  8 MB is sufficient, although I think it should've come with 16 MB....  You also need a PC interface cable, which also comes with emap deluxe.8 MB will hold detail maps for approximately a radius of 25-30 miles.  If you're driving across states, bring a laptop and the cd.The screen is sufficiently large so that you won't have to scroll painfully.  The display is clear, and the backlighting is very nice in that you don't lose any contrast.  You can look at the thing in pitch blackness and you'll see the map extremely well.This gadget is extremely fun to watch, and very satisfying-- i.e. you won't be disappointed in terms of what it can do-- whether those functionalities are worth (the price), that's a different question.  If you drive a lot and get lost a lot, or if you wish you can find shortcuts if you're stuck in traffic, it's definitely worth it.  Also keep in mind that the metroguide CDs cost (extra).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product that does the job well", "unixReviewTime": 977270400, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2000"}
