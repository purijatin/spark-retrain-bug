BUT, I purchased the Roads &amp; Recreation CD-ROM and found that maps in the North Carolina  region are over 5 years old.  I contacted Garmin and they confirmed that no  updates have been published and they have no policy regarding providing  updates to the maps!  While I like the functionality of downloading more  detailed maps into the GPS, investing $100 in obsolete maps and a company  who doesn't seem to view this as a problem bothers me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great GPS, but Garmin is not maintaining their maps!", "unixReviewTime": 947203200, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2000"}
