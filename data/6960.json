I use  it every time I go off-roading, cruising, bikeing, or hiking. I have not  yet had one glitch in the unit and it still runs as good as day one! It  hasn't gone through much toruture because it has been mounted in my SUV,  but it has held up very nicely!Since my last review, Garmin has updated  the software on the emap which adds a sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset  feature which is VERY NICE! It gives you an attractive little diagram of  the earth and where the sun and moon are along with written info.I have  used the emap to its capability and would still HIGHLY recommend this GPS  to anyone because it is very adaptable to any lifestyle. Garmin even makes  a handle bar mount for you to take it on your bike or atv. There are just  endless possibilities with this little contraption.Overall Grade: VERY  recommendable! If you want the technical info, look at my APRIL review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Long-term emap update", "unixReviewTime": 968025600, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2000"}
