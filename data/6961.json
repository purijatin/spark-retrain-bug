I received it within the stated shipping period and in excellent condition.  Upon opening the package, I thought there may have been a mistake. The shipped unit looked brand new. No blemishes or scratches anywhere.Works and tested flawlessly when tested next to my Cuda 250. I purchased the handheld to be a backup for when I used a different kayak or travel to another island.It took a bit of fumbling around to figure out all of the nuances. Although the manual was included..... who reads the manual anyway? :)A recommended product if you want a backup or want an entry level handheld gps.  No bells or whistles needed, unless you're into that sort of stuff.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Garmin eTrex", "unixReviewTime": 1227571200, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2008"}
