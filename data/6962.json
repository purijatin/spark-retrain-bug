Reception can be irritating, but it seems to do better than most -- it's locked on 5 birds / 20 feet in my living room.  Battery life is great (I used NiMH rechargables), the screen is great, interface is intuitive, etc.I've decided to give one to my dad for his birthday.I definitely recommend the PC cable w/ 12V adapter (part #010-10268-00; double-check Amazon's recommendation), as there is a lot of free and not-so-free mapping and waypoint management software (TopoGrafix, for starters).It holds 500 waypoints and ~ 1500 trackpoints (10 tracks).  In 3 years of long (~ 60 mi) rides, long car trips, etc I've not had a problem with the memory limits.The price is right, the unit works great, and it's plenty of GPS for my knocking around.  And, for the record, I can get readings in commercial aircraft -- just hold it up to the window and give it time to acquire.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "3 + years old, I still love it.", "unixReviewTime": 1075248000, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2004"}
