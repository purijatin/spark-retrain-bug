Fits right on to the quad with a mounting unit I picked up at Amazon. It is not like a TOM TOM or a Magellen GPS but it will leave you a trail back to where you started from very easy to operate and you can save your spots so you can go back again. Also tells you the best hunting and fishing times from where you are and tells you when the sun will go down and rise so you know when to turn back before night falls. I bought it so I would not get lost and it has worked out perfect for me. Also tells you alt. speed you are going at and much more. When you turn it on for the first time it takes a little bit to get the sattelights, but after that it turns on fast. Takes batteries so if you go out take a extra set just in case it dies. It remembers where you are. Over all this unit is cost effective and if you get lost you will be happy to have this great unit to get you back. You do not want to land up somewhere for days with no food and cold temps. I am not a survival kind of guy so this is a must to have for me. I hope this reveiw was helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GPS FOR ATV OR QUAD", "unixReviewTime": 1167868800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2007"}
