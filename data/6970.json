It did not track the satellites initially so I returned it. I had the same difficulty with the second unit. The seller couldn't explain why both malfunctioned so I just got my money back.  My advice is to take 2 AA batteries with you, open the package, install them and test the unit before you leave the parking lot. I guess there are no satellites over Gray, Georgia.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Doesn't work", "unixReviewTime": 1203206400, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2008"}
