It really is a great buy. Does what it's suppose to do. I am a novice hiker. I use this so at the very least if I get lost I will be able to find myself back to my car!  Great buy for the price. Just don't forget to mark key waypoints so you could trackback.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1183939200, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2007"}
