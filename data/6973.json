Cordes", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I really have no major complaints about my Garmin eTrex (lovingly called \"the yellow eTrex\").  The interface is simple, and the unit is small and light.Some may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the thumb-stick for easier interface navigation.  I was one such person, and I have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the up/down buttons that you're limited to with the yellow eTrex.Buyer beware when it comes to USED yellow eTrex models.  Many versions of it were sold that were not WAAS enabled.  You can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable WAAS.  If not, you're looking at a slightly less accurate model (but if the price is right for you, it shouldn't matter too much).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Capable, Affordable - A Great Value", "unixReviewTime": 1179100800, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2007"}
