First it has no software and no cable shipped with it.For the 12V cigarette lighter cable, the data cable and the software CD you'll have to spare at least and addtitional USD 150 to get the most out of the Etrex. One of the strongest points are the features you get for a relatively low price, the great yellow shape (no messy antenna)and the autonomy on two alcaline batteries. Overall, the etrex is an impressive product. My next step is the Garmin Summit. And this goes to people from Garmin &quot;You've got yourself some additional brand loyalty&quot;.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Value For Money", "unixReviewTime": 1001894400, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2001"}
