Well it has exceded my expectations in every respect. First of all the one I just received has a newer software revision. It has WAAS and is software revision 3.10 which has a new screen which my friends with revision 2.* doesn't have. I looked on there website and they don't offer this revision for download so it must be something that just brand new usits offer. Well anyways...I use this with a program called ExpertGPS which overlays my tracked trails on an Aerial Photomap from Satellites. So cool. I can see excatly where I rode. Mine worked flawlessly in the woods. Now it is winter here and there are no leaves on the trees but I think it will work just as good in the summer. I got the bike mount and mounted the unit to my Yamaha Kodiaks handle bars. Workes great. Battery seems to last a very long time for me. I have used it a few days hours at a time and there still going. I am one very satisfied customer. Oh you need to get the serial cable to hook this to a computer to view your trails and edit your waypoints and many other cool stuff.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for ATV use!!", "unixReviewTime": 1110758400, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2005"}
