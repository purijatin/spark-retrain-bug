I've used it for about two weeks and am very impressed.  It is very small and light and easily fits in a pocket.  I bought the bike mount accessory and have mounted this on my bike. It's small enough that it doesn't add a lot of weight or get in the way.  Although it lacks mapping capabilities and some more advance features, it does everything that you really need a GPS to do.I live in the desert so I have not been able to test this under tree cover but - surprisingly --  it works great sitting on the passenger seat of my truck.  Other units I've seen wouldn't function inside of a vehicle without an external antenna.It seems to be very accurate and I have been able to get a reported accuracy of  16 feet.  I was amazed at how accurately it was able to record my speed and distance traveled.The manual could be written more clearly but the unit is very intuitive.  I've never used a GPS before but was quickly able to figure out how to use all of the features.  The buttons placemat was supposed to be designed for one hand operation.  However, because the unit is so small, and I have  large hands, it was a little awkward for me.  I ended up using two hands to work the unit.The display is readable in bright sunlight and the backlight feature makes it possible to use the unit in dimly lit situations.I do have a gripe about battery life.  It is supposed to run for 22 hours in &quot;battery save mode.&quot;  In regular mode, I went though my first set of batteries after about 10-12 hours of use.  If you're taking this into the field - bring lots of spare batteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great features, great price, small and easy to  use", "unixReviewTime": 972259200, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2000"}
