I only need it for location coordinates and it works great. I tried setting markers and waypoints to find my way back to a starting point, but the unit seemed to want me to return in a straighter line vs the one I walked. Many other features I have yet to use and may not need as I only need a location point. For the money, I got what I paid for.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "As is . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1186704000, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2007"}
