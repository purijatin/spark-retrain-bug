Used it a coupla years, then it died on a geocaching trip.  Although the Lowrance cost less and had more features, I went right down to Wally World and bought another eTrex -- this time the H model with more sensitivity.  For one thing, I needed it NOW.  But besides that, the Lowrance was just too irritating to use while the eTrex is a pleasure.That said, the problem with the base model eTrex is that it requires a special adapter ($$$) to connect it into your computer to download waypoints, and it'll only hold waypoint names of six characters.  The adapter costs so much that it's cheaper to buy the next model up, which has a USB connector and plugs right in.  The only reason I didn't was that I already had the adapter.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Buy the next model up", "unixReviewTime": 1365724800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2013"}
