Edelman", "helpful": [44, 46], "reviewtext": "I've been thinking about a GPS for kayaking for at least two years, but none of the units on the market met my requirements for ruggedness, water resistence, utility and low cost- until the eTrex.This is a *superb*  little box. It's not only rugged and waterproof, it's very well enginnered  and very handy. It provides all the necessary information needed for  navigation- location, speed (real and average), distance traveled,  direction, bearing to a waypoint, and so forth. You can store mutilple  routes, too. Until Garmin comes out with a similarly sized package that  does detailed mapping this will be my main navigating tool on land and  water.I've been using it for kayaking and bicycling for a few hundred  miles now and I have no complaints- well, I suppose it would be nice if it  floated, too, but barring that I just keep its lanyard attached to my kayak  when I go out paddling.Overall, a superb value for bikers, hikers and  small boaters.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb value for the money", "unixReviewTime": 963273600, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2000"}
