What a big mistake![My background: I'm a mountain climber, experienced land navigator, and use my GPS off-trail all the time. My normal use for the GPS is to confirm my location and figure out the bearings to other mountains so I can be sure which summit is which when viewing them from new locations. But I have actually used the GPS for real navigation when caught out on a glacier in dense fog.]The problem isn't the unit itself, really. The antenna works fine and easily picks up a solid signal, even from inside my house (top floor, not bottom floor). But the operating system is TERRIBLE.The GPS38 was much more usable. For example, this unit does not even feature a simple \"you are here\" page. You have to actually mark a waypoint and then get it to display the location of that waypoint.For only about $... more you can get the Garmin eTrex Venture, which is much more useful. Frankly, I can't wait to break my eTrex so I can justify upgrading it.This is the bottom end of GPS units, and it shows.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "too dumbed-down", "unixReviewTime": 1041465600, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2003"}
