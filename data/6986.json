I use it for hiking and fishing and love it.  It tells you haw far you have travel and at what speed. It tracks your progress. It allows you to save up to 500  waypoints! The only major disadvatage is not being able to download maps,  but since most maping GPS units cost over $250, I will take it. I was also  looking at the Magellan 315. They are very simular but for my needs this  one is perfect, less expensive and waterproof! I highly recommend this  unit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great basic GPS", "unixReviewTime": 957398400, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2000"}
