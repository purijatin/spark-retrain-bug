With nothing to compare it to, I can report the following:  Although the instructions are straight forward, I found that the buttons are not so easy to navigate.  I make many mistakes in programing and have to start over.  I also found the this is not very accurate.  At 500 feet, the GPS unit will show any direction.  I have to get to within 250 feet of a way point to start getting any type of accuracy.  If I did not know the direction of the way point at 400-500 feet I literally have to walk in circles and watch the unit point me false directions.  Again at 250 feet it is accurate.I have used this in the UP of Michigan and it takes about 5 minutes to get the satellites up and running. Also, if you want to save the information on your computer you will need to buy the cords, about $20.00, once I purchased these I then found I would have to purchase the software, it was not free at Garmin, so that would be another $20.00. I returned the cords and did not get the software.  So if you want to save your information plan on spending another $40.00.For my first GPS I think it is okay.  I think if you are hiking, you would need to do a lot more research and probably spend more money to get something with greater accuracy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ony Okay", "unixReviewTime": 1165017600, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2006"}
