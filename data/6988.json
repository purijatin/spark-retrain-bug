For some reason it took serveral minutes to get a signal the first time though.**Just a warning if you are an impulse buyer like me.**The Amazon add has details on the product and it shows a color display.  That is the eTrex Venture Cx model.  The one here is the basic.  I was expecting color.  My bad for buying so quickly without reading.  duh.Also I expected a data cable.  Any other product on the planet comes with one if needed.  I just bought the cable today.  With shipping it was $45.  I didn't expect this either.  Again.  My bad.I'm sure I'll have fun with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Word of warning", "unixReviewTime": 1177027200, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2007"}
