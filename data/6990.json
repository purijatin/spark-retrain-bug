That is 30 minutes at 3.3 feet.  Forget that one.  The battery compartment isn't rated for this.....so it leaks big time.  I called Garmin about this and they said that nothing can be done.  There is no fix.  This was December 2000.  Since it eats batteries, I bought a Radio Shack digital camera battery kit.  It has 4 ni-mh batteries rated at 1500mah and a chargerfor $22.  This unit worked very well.  Since the batteries compartment isn't waterproof the batteries got wet.  I was in sea water and these batteries got ruined.  If you plan on buying this GPS and using it around water, I would be careful in not using expensive batteries in it.  Windsurfing, Kayaking, canoeing, white water rafting and the rest, be careful.  If you buy their super expensive cable, you can update your unit free from their web site.  They do offer great upgrades for their products, free.  Wow.  I only give the unit 2 stars.  I own three of their products and this is the worse one for not living up to what they say it will do.  The best one out there for tuff service  is the GPS 45 version.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "NOT waterprof", "unixReviewTime": 978912000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2001"}
