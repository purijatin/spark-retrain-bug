The signposts are there, of course, hidden behind a corner as you pass them by, or as an indication to a town fifteen miles further on from the town you'd expect to be signposted in the first place. All this turns a long day in the saddle, into a very long day in the saddle. But with the eTrek loaded with waypoints, I simply have to follow the guiding - Go To -  pointer,  and save myself a lot of hassle.The eTrek hasn't saved my life, as yet, but one's imagination can fill in the blanks. Just remember to carry extra batteries and make sure that your mobile phone is charged :-)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "12 Satellites.", "unixReviewTime": 1032134400, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2002"}
