I have had mine for about 10 days now and have found it to be very useful.  Keep in mind this is a 'basic' unit as it cannot have maps uploaded to it. However it does what it claims to with effeciency and accuracy.  I was amazed that something this small could locate me in my car or while walking.  I do lots of outdoor photography so this unit is perfect for marking spots that I want to come to again.  I am already pretty good at navigating myself around most places (one of those gifts god bestowed upon me)so the etrex's simple design and use is perfect for me.If you are light hiker or are just getting into the world of owning a GPS the etrex is perfect for you.  If you desire an onscreen map then a higher end model will be more to your liking.My only fret with etrex is its inability to pan around your track that you create.  You are only able to zoom in and out!! Hopefully a future driver update will fix that.Happy Trails ...
