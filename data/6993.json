Its very small and portable but really packs a whallop!!  I can set this to track my route, go on an adventure, get home and download the data into my computer, and then print out a topographic map showing my route and any points of interest I marked along the way.  (the downloading and map capability are accesories not sold with the GPS)  Anybody can pick this up and learn it in no time.  I use it both for business and pleasure and never lets me down.  Great toy!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A locator must for ANYONE!!!", "unixReviewTime": 989452800, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2001"}
