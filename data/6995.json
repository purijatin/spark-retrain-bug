My GPS shows sunrise time as 18:51 and Sunset ast 06:30 (???) and it is inaccurate even if you transpost it.  Etrex loses a * for this(3) Useless in heavy tree cover (in any GPS)(4) Battery life could have been betterDespite all that, I am very happy with my etrex, it cost me exactly $100, meets almost all the features that I am looking for.Many of my friends ask me this question - Are you sure that this GPS works in India ?Ofcourse, it does, it is a GLOBAL positioning system !  I have used it in US, Canada, Singapore and Korea and works everywhere, even in the forests in western ghats in India.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The handy little yellow thing - excellent entry level GPS", "unixReviewTime": 1130630400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2005"}
