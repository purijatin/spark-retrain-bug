I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Perfdect Nook HD+ hook up", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}
