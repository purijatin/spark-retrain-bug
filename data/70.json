I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great mount for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1297468800, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2011"}
