Three factors make these discs stand out as your best buy:First of all, they are rated for burning at up to 16x, which is nice for those with fast CD-ROM burners. Sometimes you'll find that substandard media won't REALLY burn as fast as the label claims, which is very annoying. With these Memorex discs, however, I've NEVER experienced a problem with diminished burn speed. They cook perfectly at 16x every time.Second is reliability. Out of my last spindle I had NOT A SINGLE DEFECTIVE CD. Not one defective CD out of fifty blanks! Quite remarkable, considering that many blank CD vendors consider a 10-15% failure to be acceptable.Finally, the low cost of these excellent discs- just fifty cents each- is hard to beat...If you are in need of blank recordable CDs, look no further. You won't find a better choice anywhere.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High quality and low cost", "unixReviewTime": 985564800, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2001"}
