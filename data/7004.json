I use this with a Canon Digital Elph S300 and it makes memory a non-issue.  Setting the camara on low compression and the highest resolution, I can fit about 150 images on the card.  At this quality, I can print photos through Ofoto.com on photographic paper, up to 8X10, and they look like they were taken on 35mm film.If you set the resolution/compression to place images on the web, 500-1,000 pictures would fit on a single card!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Must Have for Digital Photography", "unixReviewTime": 1005609600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2001"}
