The &quot;wimpy&quot; 8 MB CompactFlash card that came with the unit would only  hold one (1) uncompressed, high-resolution picture - I needed more.  I  started looking and found this; the SanDisk 128 MB CompactFlash.  I read on  the Nikon technical support web page that SanDisk is the OEM for Nikon's  CompactFlash cards, so I felt pretty safe selecting this card.  The only  question I had was &quot;would my Coolpix 950 work with a card this  large?&quot;  The answer is a resounding YES!  (according to friends, it  will work in the new Coolpix 990 also)The card formatted in the camera  perfectly and has simply worked for the past nine months.  I shoot all  pictures in high resolution with a moderate compression level, allowing me  to store more than 110 - 2.1 MegaPixel pictures in the camera - plenty for  me.  Recently, we took a five-day trip to Disney World - this card captured  ALL of our pictures perfectly.  If you get this, check out one of the USB  card readers as well - the serial connection is just way too slow for  transferring this much data.Executive Summary:  Buy it now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding Product - Essential for Nikon Coolpix", "unixReviewTime": 969408000, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2000"}
