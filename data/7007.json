Compare with Viking  (I bought two from an internet store because it should be the best one), SimpleTech, Microtech, 128MB Compact Flash Card. SanDisk CompactFlash Card read and write speeds are so bad. I use CANON PRO70 and CANON D60 camera, which have RAW format. SanDisk CompactFlash take twice time to read and write data. Even the newest SanDisk Ultra CompactFlash doesn't work faster than others. However, its price is so high.You could get full test review on-line.If you use basic digital camera with below 2.0 megapixels resolution and save with JPG format, it is ok for you with 128MB. Otherwise, please don't buy this one. Choosing other company's CompactFlash is better for you.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "IT'S TOO BAD!", "unixReviewTime": 1030924800, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2002"}
