Although I already had two 64 MB SanDisk CompactFlash cards, I bought the 128 MB when I upgraded to the Canon G1.  In a minimally compressed mode the Canon can store 72 images on the SanDisk 128 MB card.  I actually filled all my cards with vacation photos!  Glad I made the purchase.  This card has worked flawlessly for me and the price is very reasonable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "MEGASTORAGE!!!
