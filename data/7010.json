I use it in a Nikon Coolpix 700 (2.1 mp) set at the basic mode (1600 x 1200, apx 240k per pic with full compression). I took 471 pictures and had room for over 100 more. Download of 108 meg with a USB card reader took about 5 minutes. A side effect I had not counted on was that write times increased as the card got full. With a 16MB card I never noticed this but toward the end of 128MB the delay was very noticeable. \"Boot time\" (pause after turning on the camera) was increased too. Again, something that was never an issue with a smaller card. A good reason to hang on to your older, smaller ram cards for things like sporting events frames per second are important.  If picture quality is essential to your work, the size fo the card makes full TIFF images (8 meg per) a viable option. Memory may not be cheaper for a long time. I paid the same for this card that I paid for a 16MB card 2 years ago. Highly recomended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "6 days at Disney on one card!!", "unixReviewTime": 1017360000, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2002"}
