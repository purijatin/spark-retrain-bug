I am using this 128MB Compact Flash card in my Canon S230 Digital Elph camera- 3.2 megapixels.  The 128MB card is perfect for my purposes.  I currently have 114 still photos and 3 short video clips stored and am still going.  I've erased lots of pictures, downloaded to my computer, and printed on my computer and my HP 100 printer (with no computer connection.) I've encountered no problems and the quality of my photos is excellent.  Although I've only had this card for a short time I have a SmartMedia card by SanDisk that has been used repeatedly for a year now and still functions beautifully.  These may be expensive at first but they last.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1040428800, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2002"}
