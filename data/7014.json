I have a one-megapixel digital camera;  at full resolution and highest quality, this puppy will hold close to 500 pictures.  That's slightly over a week's worth of photos for me, so it's the perfect size.  The product was plug-n-play, I didn't even have to &quot;format&quot; it the first time I used it.  When (not if!) I upgrade to a two- or three-megapixel camera, I'm taking this memory card with me!  Since it is solid-state, it should almost never wear out, so this is probably the smallest unit you should buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable worker", "unixReviewTime": 1010102400, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2002"}
