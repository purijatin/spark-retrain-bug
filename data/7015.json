While it does store plenty of high quality images, the issue I have with this card is the read/write rate.  As the card fills up with pictures it becomes slow to store the picture you just took.  I estimate that this took up to 15 seconds, an eternity while waiting to take another picture.  Even more painful is reviewing and deleting pictures.  Going through thumbnails of about 100 pictures took 5-10 minutes as the camera struggled to read from the memory card.  I also took along a Lexar 16MB 8X card that displayed my pictures almost instantaneously.  This is a lower capacity card but it gave me a comparison.  Sandisk doesn't do a very good job of stating its read/write speeds.  These speeds(along with # of MBs) is what distinguishes mainstream from professional quality cards.  Professional photographers don't have time to wait to take another picture or review their older pictures.  I am buying a large capacity Lexar 12X card to be my primary high storage card and the Sandisk card will be my backup for overflow situations.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Snadisk is slower than some competitors", "unixReviewTime": 1035590400, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2002"}
