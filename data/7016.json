It's so nice not to have to deal with the slow serial connection. I got it a few months ago, plugged it into the back of my computer, and it worked straight away. The only confusion I had was how to put in the SmartMedia card (metallic strips facing down) and that was in the guide I got with the Reader, so that was a non-issue.The SmartMedia card shows up on your desktop as a free-standing disk. Click on it, and you get a list of all your photos/files. You can either work with them straight off the SmartMedia or copy them over to your system. You can also delete the photos off the disk by dragging them into the trash and emptying. It's great if you want to keep certain photos (or files) on the SmartMedia and delete others.A few words of caution, which the guide warns you about- make sure you plug this reader into a USB port in the back of your computer or one of the ones in your monitor. It needs the power from direct ports- it doesn't work if you plug it into an unpowered hub or your keyboard. Also, make sure you drag and drop the SmartMedia disk icon into the trash before you pull it out of the reader, otherwise your Mac will crash.I highly recommend this to anyone with a USB-enabled Mac. It's completely worth the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Macs!!", "unixReviewTime": 988329600, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2001"}
