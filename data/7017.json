I have transferred thousands of photos to my PC without a hitch. It is so small it sits on top of my monitor and is known to my system as device G. All the folks that have reported problems with installation undoubtedly had those problems. I didn't. And I have a Zip drive, a CD/RW drive and 4 devices total hooked up to my USB ports, including a printer and DSL modem. Before this mess would work on my 2 year old Dell, I had to download new BIOS for the machine. Anytime you add stuff to a PC, there may be conflicts that need resolving. But I don't believe this SmartMedia card reader is the total cause of anybody's problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Speedy and Cute", "unixReviewTime": 970704000, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2000"}
