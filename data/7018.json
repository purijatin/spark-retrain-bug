The thing constantly locks up.  The only way I can get it to be even slightly stable is to reboot between reading cards.  Otherwise the system locks up whenever going from one card to the next.  Horrible drivers.  My experience with it on Win2000 was too short to be sure, but having to live with this product has been bad enough.  I hardly use it now, but I'm disappointed to see that I'll likely have to throw it away when I go to WinXP.  No matter, it's barely worked anyway.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Stability is totally unpredictable", "unixReviewTime": 1011916800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2002"}
