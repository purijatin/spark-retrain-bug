They can be difficult to set-up, as the software (in both cases) required an update from their website (nice site, user-friendly) and, more importantly, there are known conflicts with other device drivers you may have on your computer (such as CD-RW drives and Zip drives). While these conflicts are mentioned on the SanDisk website, the solutions they offered were not always helpful. Once solved, this device is great. I have since purchased the Viking reader and have encountered no conflicts at all.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Beware, Conflicts Exist.", "unixReviewTime": 995414400, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2001"}
