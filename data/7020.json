Patton", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "Before purchasing a smart media card reader I had read the reviews here and was not overly impressed. But since Best Buy has a 30 day return policy and the SanDisk was on sale I thought why not?Well needless to say it was a great purchase. This reader is lightning fast! It downloads images from my Digital Camera in a matter of seconds. I also have the Adaptec CD Creator software and have had no conflicts whatsoever.It was also very easy to install, and straight to the point. So I say if you have a Best Buy near you try it out, if it does not work return it for a full refund.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No Conflicts, No Problems.", "unixReviewTime": 988588800, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2001"}
