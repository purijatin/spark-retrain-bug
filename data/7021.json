I would like to buy a card reader, but the reviews are scary -- especially the cards getting damaged by the reader.  I wrote to SanDisk about this problem, but have heard nothing back.  I hope more purchasers will write additional reviews to let us know about the card damage problem", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "How Can You Know?", "unixReviewTime": 984528000, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2001"}
