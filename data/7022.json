Zisk \"daman\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I finally ordered the SmartMedia ImageMate, even after reading some pretty horrific reviews (and some very good ones). The SanDisk web page says to check the CDW EasyCreate, and mine was OK (3.5c, &quot;c&quot; makes it OK). Received the reader, installed the software, plugged it in to an empty USB port, stuck in a half-full SmartCard from my Olympus 360L camera, clicked on the &quot;G&quot; drive, and there it was - all of it! Downloaded 40 images in 15-20 seconds (not 20-30 minutes!), played around with uploads, deletes, any old files (not only images) - WORKS LIKE MAGIC! (**FAST** magic...) I have Windows 98, Pentium III at 733 MHz, a Costco USB splitter, 3 or 4 other USB devices, shut down &amp; restart each day,and the system still crashes once a day or so. Pretty standard setup, I think. Good luck to all!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unbelievable machine!", "unixReviewTime": 993600000, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2001"}
