I LOVE this pointing device! It is comfortable and &quot;falls readily to hand&quot; as it were, it never gets jerky, jumpy or stuck since it is fully optical, and it is incredibly smooth. My wrist/hand pain went away!As a bonus, I LOVE playing games with this device. Manipulating your character in games like Quake, Heretic or Ultima IX is so much more natural using the thumb-ball on the trackman than it used to be using a mouse... It's easy to feel much more directly connected to the game, to be less conscious of the presence of a pointing device.As a last note, the quality is great. Mine is now three years old and going strong, with no degredation of any sort. If anything, it is better with use -- the ball and the surface on which it rests have become more polished and more silky over time!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This product saved my hand!", "unixReviewTime": 1009065600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2001"}
