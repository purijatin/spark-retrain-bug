Culver", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought this mouse to relieve some strange tingling feelings in my wrists &amp; forearms that I can only guess were the initial symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.  I had been using a regular mouse - the one that came with  my pc.  Since I have been using the TrackMan the symptoms have disappeared.  The motion of my pointer is now entirely up to the motion of my thumb  rather than the motion of my whole arm.Besides the relief for my  tendons, I also get the benefit of using less desk space for rolling my  mouse around (I can now have my coffee cup within inches of my keyboard!).  I have had to clean the ball once in the last 3 months.  Some dust had  worked its way into the ball-socket and caused the ball to stick in place  when first using it in the morning.  The ball removed easily, I blew the  dust out, and the ball was free to move as new.This mouse has proven  itself enough to me that I am not even tempted to expense it to my  employer.  If I have to leave - I am taking my TrackMan with me! :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "good for my wrist", "unixReviewTime": 961804800, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2000"}
