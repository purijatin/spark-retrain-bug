I have a cramped desktop and no room to  mess around with a mouse and mousepad.  The TrackMan takes care of that  problem.  It is easy to operate and the software was easy to install and  run.  There are a lot of extra features that the middle wheel can do.  It  works as  a butoon and a wheel for scrolling making scrolling through  documents or webpages much easier and quicker and the price is unbeatable!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 968284800, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2000"}
