It doesn't strain my hand as my palm rests comfortably over the trackball.  The trackball is extremely efficient to use in maneuvering around the computer screen.  I can clean it by putting a paper clip end to unlock the ball.  This is nice because debris and residue can build up immediately underneath the ball.  I have had my trackball for about 9 years nine, and it still works like a gem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Trackball Ever!!", "unixReviewTime": 1269648000, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2010"}
