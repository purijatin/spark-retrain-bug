I switched to the trackball and have been \"tracking\" for over three years with the same trackball with no problems. I have the original non-wheeled model and it has remained as smooth, accurate, and responsive as the day I took it out of the box. I use the wheeled version at home and I'm almost as pleased with it. The ball action is just as glassy smooth, but I'm not a fan of the wheel. It is rather clunky and its action is way too firm to use as a middle button. I find it difficult to click without accidentally scrolling. Otherwise, this is an exceptional product. As for gaming action, I attribute my status of Fragmeister to this trackball. There are few things more frustrating than running out of mouse pad in a firefight. This never happens with a trackball.***UPDATE***It's now been over seven years with the same, trusty trackball. I love this thing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An ergonomic godsend", "unixReviewTime": 981072000, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2001"}
