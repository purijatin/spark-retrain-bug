I switched to a trackman with the thumbball many years ago and have had no trouble since. The positioning of the ball allows for the hand and arm to be totally supported in a relaxed position. I recommend also paying attention to the positioning of the chair arm. When the mouse and chair arm are properly positioned the comfort is fantastic, especially for long hours. I find using the thumb rather than the fingers easier on the wrist and forearm, as well as more accurate. Finger balls tend to be larger and heavier to move while the muscle is smaller and the movement awkward. The thumb position solves this as well as you could ever hope to. Regular cleaning is easy (and advised). If your Trackman starts slowing down or skipping, you need to clean it. I use alot of handlotion. This and lint tend to collect on the inside points where the ball touches, but is no problem to clean out. It is a sturdy product that lasts for many many years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best for Drawing", "unixReviewTime": 1026086400, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2002"}
