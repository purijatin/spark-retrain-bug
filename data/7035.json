Which surprisingly enough cost over $125.00 back in the day. When these ones came out I of course upgraded. When they were being discontinued and were cheap I bought three for backup. I have over the years bought perhaps seven more of them. Two of them I flat wore out, several have been stolen from me by family members who know I love them too much to kill them and three are stashed in my closet because it is becoming impossible to find them anymore. Almost everyone in my immediate family uses them. We have tried numerous other trackballs over the years and no one likes them as well as we like this one.I curse the executive at Logitech who decided to discontinue them. Oh... and I never did have any more carpal tunnel problems after I started using them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hands down the best track ball mouse I have ever used.", "unixReviewTime": 1397174400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2014"}
