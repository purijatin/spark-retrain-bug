Everything else was just ok.The headset itself fit perfectly and was very convenient.Overall - 1 star for bad reception.Would recommend Panasonic RPHT 355 headphones for their 16.4 ft (5 m.) long cord. That's what I use now. ASIN: B00004TZJI", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "If the sound had just been better...", "unixReviewTime": 1020902400, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2002"}
