But based on price, it seemed like a risk worth taking.  Have I ever been pleasantly surprised!I use these primarily for working out.  I have them hooked up to my mp3 player and then to the transmitter.  I have the transmitter in the basement less than 10 feet from my workout area and have had zero problems.  However, if I decide to go upstairs then I have issues with the walls, interference etc.  But I knew that was going to happen since my cordless 900mhz phone did the same thing.The unit is SO portable it makes moving the transmitter a breeze.  If I want to wear the headphones outside, I would move the transmitter to a better location, not leave it in the basement.For someone who want to use them while they work out and is willing to move the transmitter every once in a while based on where you are, then this is perfect.  No more flailing wires on bouncing mp3 players while on the treadmill.Once tuned in, sound quality was great for me.  If I'm working out or doing yardwork all I want to be able to hear is the music to keep me going.Overall, just use common sense.  If your cordless phone has issues in your house, then guess what, so will these 900mhz headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones, depending on how you use them", "unixReviewTime": 1055548800, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2003"}
