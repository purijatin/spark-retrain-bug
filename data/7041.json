I have an average size head, 7 1/4 but I can see how they are tight on the ears and could be more comfortable.  I simply slide them forward so they are more on my temples.  I wore them for 3 hours with no annoyance.  The reception was good once I dialed them in and haven't re-adjusted them yet. I walked around the house and out to the street and didn't lose clarity.  I did lose it when I had 3 walls, 2 drywall and 1 brick but I don't plan on listening to tv out in the driveway often.  For the money they were worth it and I can stay up and not bother the sleeping kid or wife.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I got them for $20", "unixReviewTime": 1111622400, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2005"}
