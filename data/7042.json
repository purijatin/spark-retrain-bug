But as you move around the house they constantly lose the signal and you find you have to constantly tune in. And there are only two weak signal possitions on the dial on either the A and B channel. Not only that, but the batteries die out quickly. My dad, who bought these headphones to listen to the TV and CDs because he's nearly deaf (and subsequently doesn't hear the high pitched hum in the background because of high tone nerve loss), is going through batteries like water. Maybe some people can buy batteries at this rate, but not him. Not only that, but the tuning wheel is so close to where you can get a hold of them to succesfully take them off that it's hard not to grab them by the tuning wheel when taking them off. Which, as you can guess, screws up the tuning everytime. If only there were handles on each ear cup for easy removal. We're sending these back and looking into the more expensive rechargable ones from a company that specializes in hearing loss technology.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Too much tuning, cost:performance ratio in doubt", "unixReviewTime": 1037491200, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2002"}
