I am not sure that the same holds for this one, though the price is certainly too good to pass on.If you've owned a Panasonic VCR before then you expect reliability and ease of use.  This unit delivers on that...while including 4 heads, commercial skip, a lighted remote (finally!), and the entire bevy of features now standard on every VCR.The real negative is that it is much noiser than the model it replaces; particularly when it is rewinding.  We are talking a good bit noise, enough that it makes me want to turn up the TV volume while it is rewinding.I actually went out and purchased a JVC VCR to consider as an alternative, but returned that one and kept the Panasonic becaese the JVC was way too confusing to program.So why did I keep this one?  It is very inexpensive, I like the features, and I can live with the added noise.  I think this one is a keeper unless the noise will drive you crazy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Inexpensive, a bit noisy, but worth it", "unixReviewTime": 971136000, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2000"}
