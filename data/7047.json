Though I have copied everything digital, this is a backup and a museum collection. I am impressed with Panasonic brand having come for over a dozen years. In an era when electronics go dead soon, this is impressive for a mechanical device nonetheless. I have a Panasonic Blu Ray player now and a Panasonic 1080HD camcorder. Good that they are going with the tide unlike Kodak.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I have this Panasonic VCR for past 12+ years", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}
