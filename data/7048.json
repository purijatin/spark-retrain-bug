I wasn't aware until recently that some people consider the DVD of The  Matrix to be a challenge.  That was until I saw it on someone else's DVD  player.  My little Toshiba SD-1200 handled it perfectly with clear,  well-defined picture and great sound.  I have had no problems with this DVD  player and really have no complaints about it as long as my remote works.  Yes, I would like to be able to access the operations without having to use  the remote.  Otherwise, I am extremely well satisfied and would highly  recommend this DVD player to anyone who wants great performance at a low  price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm not a technical genius", "unixReviewTime": 966384000, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2000"}
