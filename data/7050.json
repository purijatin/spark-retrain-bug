It's been flawless since the day I set it up. Many friends went for other more expensive brands and models and have encountered many dificulties since day one. In the set up, recognition of movies and over all execution.I recomend it to anyone who is planning to buy a DVD.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "no need to buy another", "unixReviewTime": 1006300800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2001"}
