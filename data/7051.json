Fox", "helpful": [18, 19], "reviewtext": "I was shocked to find a high quality name brand player at this price with DTS out, component video out, and lots of other bells and whistles (zoom, expanded black level, etc.).  It compares very favorably with my 1 year old+ Pioneer 414, which cost me $100 more.  Its ease of use and features  had me banish the Pioneer to my bedroom!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great player at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 953424000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2000"}
