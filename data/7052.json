Sound and picture as rich as can be. Remote features are excellent, allowing for more tricks than you'll use. Chose this after too  many negative reviews of low price Sony models (I'm sure everything is  fixed, but I wasn't going to take a chance over the holidays). Wasn't a  Toshiba fan before this purchase (simple Sony prejudice) but now I'm  willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large TV's. You'll enjoy  this player and its price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best, by far, for the money. Not a flaw.", "unixReviewTime": 956966400, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2000"}
