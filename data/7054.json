Its not too complicated, just insert the disc and work your way through the dvd's menu.  You are not paying for the extras like multiple disc play.Overall, this machine is quiet and reliable.  It get s lots of use in my house, and the only complaint is that the remote could be a lot better.  However, from a practical standpoint we don't need to do all that much with the remote other than navigate through the dvd menus.This unit will not be the one to select for a high end system, but if you are looking for a basic entry level until than look no further.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "solid, simple, entry level model", "unixReviewTime": 971136000, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2000"}
