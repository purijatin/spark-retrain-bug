Bagchee \"Tech Snob\"", "helpful": [2, 6], "reviewtext": "I have had this drive for about 10 days now and the performance seems quite reliable. However, two things bother me about this drive:1. The noise. I have a brand new Dell Dimension 8200 that is a very quiet machine. I am adding this drive as a second volume and there is an annoying reverberating noise from the disk even when its not accessing. Its not an outright loud noise but persistent enough that after 15 minutes it &quot;feels&quot; very loud. I'm thinking of giving them a second chance and return this for a replacement.2. The quality of the enclosed IDE cable is deplorable. The instructions in the package suggested using that cable to &quot;maximize performance.&quot; Looking at the substandard cable, I thought of leaving the original Dell cable in there. When the sound kept disturbing me, I decided to give the Maxtor cable a try, for what it was worth. As expected, that didn't have any effect on the noise level.I did find a quirk with Windows 2000 in the process that might be helpful to other users. Apparently, when you switch IDE cables Win2K loses track of the bootable device! Switching back to the original cable does not help either. I tried all forms of recovery and repair but to no avail. I had to do a full install to get it up and and running again. This is not a problem with XP Home or Professional though.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A mediocre hard drive", "unixReviewTime": 1014595200, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2002"}
