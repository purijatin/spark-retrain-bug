I would say they are a mid-market product.  The price is pretty decent, the technology is there, and the drive sizes are there.You could drop a small house payment on a high end array of hard-drives...but to be honest, I have never had a problem with a Maxtor.Are they louder...I don't know I really don't set up on the decible meter.How do they benchmark?  Who knows -- benchmarking is the digital equivalent of horse handicapping.  Generally it is right on the money, but who ever is doing the benchmarking can skew the results the way they want.  And every once in the while that long-shot old mare comes in at 50 to 1 and all the other horses forgot to take their steroids that day.Did you ever notice a company that puts up a benchmark where their product isn't number one? Hmmm... Did a magazine ever put a product benchmark where the top five didn't have an advertisement in the magazine?  Am I cynical, yes...but you get my point.Now the big one.  Do they break or are prone to errors.  No more than any other drive that I used be it low-end or high-end or just right.Isn't that why they tell you to backup everything anyway?  Or is it like that tag on the mattress -- people just get a thrill by living dangerously and ripping it off?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Ok - I'll fix this problem", "unixReviewTime": 987724800, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2001"}
