Less than two weeks after my machine came off Warranty, the drive failed, completely and utterly.In breaking down my box, I found that the warranty was marked on the outside of the HD as \"aug 03\" (it's presently jul 03).  So I called Maxtor.  They claimed the HD warranty ended in May 03.  The rep asked me to \"send proof\", which after some further discussion was a fax sent to Maxtor (which I had to send 3 times).  After getting Maxtor support to help for about 15 minutes, they suddenly said, \"this drive was OEM'd by Dell and as such you have to deal with them.\"  When I pointed out that the warranty was still good according to the HD, I was handed around and eventually told, \"tough luck\".I'm going to try my luck with Western Digital.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Maxtor is French for \"miserable\"", "unixReviewTime": 1058227200, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2003"}
