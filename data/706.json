I use it and am happy with it.Pros:- Looks and feels like a Moleskine- Looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the Kindle- Looks nice on the inside and outside- Having a pad next to a Kindle is very good- Includes two reporter-style while slimmed-down MoleskinesCons:- No place to store a writing utensil- Won't fit standard Moleskine reporter books, even the soft cover ones (too rigid backing, too thick)- A lined journal would have been better- Feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose- Hard to get the elastic straps for the Kindle to look right", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good accessory, but left side is limited", "unixReviewTime": 1278979200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2010"}
