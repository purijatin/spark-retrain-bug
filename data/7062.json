Had it installed, initialized and had everything transfered from the original 4 GB drive in about 45 minutes. (Why Maxtor says you need a Windows clone is beyond me; the drive works perfectly with the Apple driver and doesn't have the limititation some early Windows versions have for paritiion sizes).The drive is quiet and fast. Everything I expected and more: the specs on the box looked like the specs for the ATA 100 model, even though it was supposed to be ATA 66. Sure enough, the drive inside the box is the &quot;H&quot; model -- the ATA 100 version.I am completely satisfied, and will probably buy a second as a slave drive eventually.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product", "unixReviewTime": 1000166400, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2001"}
