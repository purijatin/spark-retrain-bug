ZERO problemsI am always adding deleting reformating everything. I have totally beat on this drive more than any computer user. It is almost like i tried to destroy it any way i could but there really is not destroying this drive. When i first got it i even dropped it on a marble floor.(but i don't recommend this if you can help it) Didn't hurt it a bit. Maxtor is one company that has made a name for themselves by making dependable drives and they back it up with the product.As a added bonus the installation instructions were simnple and easy to understand for a computer geek or novice. That is something that is very unusual for any computer product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't Think  Twice.....Maxtor #1 By Far", "unixReviewTime": 1009411200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2001"}
