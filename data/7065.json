I snatched it up and have not had a problem with drive space since.The drive installation is simple and fairly easy, but you do need to have some understanding of the guts of your computer. After plugging in the power and drive cables and closing up the case, within ten mintues I was back up and running with more space than I knew what to do with. Since I am using this on a Mac I cannot comment on the included software.Speed wise, the drive blows away my old 4 gig. Faster access and startup is always a good thing for any computerIf you have a older computer, this is a great upgrade for it. Sure compared to newer drives the capacity is somewhat small. But most people really don't need hundreds of Gigs for normal use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent upgrade at a good price", "unixReviewTime": 1050883200, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2003"}
