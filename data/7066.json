We were definitely not disappointed.The D-360L was  the next step up from the D-340R. Then and today you cannot find a better  quality camera at this price, outside of the Olympus family.  The 360 has  all the same features of the 340-R, but adds capabilities to adjust white  balance, and tinker with spot metering, ISO and exposure settings.  It also  adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen, as well as  multiple flash and file compression settings.If you want additional zoom  power you'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $100 more.  It  adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview  screen.  If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try  looking for a D-340R.  They are still around at onine shops andit is a  great camera on the cheap!  All three of the camera have the same lens,  megapixel size etc.Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days  owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and  Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home. The camera  performed marvelously. We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more  than adequate for our needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into  our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  &quot;ger&quot; (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? The 360 will  use up to a 32MB smart media card, enough for 400+ shots at low resolution.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There is no better camera at the price!", "unixReviewTime": 968112000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2000"}
