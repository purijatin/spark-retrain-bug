The pictures are crisp, with remarkable detail.  I do have one critisism however, the battery life is appalling  :(  This thing EATS  batteries!  I have found that not using the LCD display helps a little  though.  All in all, a great little camera for a good price.  Just make  sure you have plenty of spare batteries with you on your trips (or buys  some rechargables).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Value Digital Camera", "unixReviewTime": 956534400, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2000"}
