I was a camera snob. Then had kids  and couldn't be bothered to lug around an SLR plus attachments. With the  excuse that I was buying it for my wife, I purchased one of the original  Olympus clamshell designs in 1992. Secretly I loved this little camera. Not  long after I sold the cherished Nikon. So it goes.But after 8 years, the  trusty Olympus was showing it's age. And the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times. So I was in search  of its replacement.I'm comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camera.I was intrigued  sufficiently to visit Wolf Camera and look at one.If a picture is worth  a thousand words, experiencing something must be worth at least  10,000.Unlike its 35mm cousins (Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera  comes to mind and is what I wound up buying) this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different company.It is large; won't  fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.It is heavy.It is square and  boxlike (none of the Stylus Epic's sensuous lines).If you are attracted  to one-shot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the web.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "10,000 words", "unixReviewTime": 964569600, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2000"}
