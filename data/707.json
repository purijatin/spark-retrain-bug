I have not been disapointed.  It's a sturdy case that looks great and performs well.  It's the first Kindle case I've owned that seems to be a \"permanent living space\" for my Kindle, if you know what I mean.A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right.  I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed.  If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold.  For the few notes I take on paper, it's really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so.That said, Moleskine ought to offer both a \"left\" and \"right\" handed version if the case.  I would think it'd be easy to simply flip the design.  Then people could choose which version they wanted.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does what it says, nothing more, nothing less.", "unixReviewTime": 1279670400, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2010"}
