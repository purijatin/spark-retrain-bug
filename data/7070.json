I read a lot of reviews and decided on the Olympus D-360L.  It takes great pictures for Web publishing.  I haven't even used the maximum resolution setting on it yet, as only two photos will fit on the 8MB card, and I compress the photos for the Web anyway.  I don't print pictures from it, since 35mm is so much cheaper, but I'd think 5x7 photos would look great with a good dye sublimation printer.I bought an inexpensive SmartMedia USB reader from Sandisk ($30), so transferring pictures is quick, painless, and doesn't eat batteries.  As far as I know, the USB reader will work on a Mac, but I don't own a Mac.  The only thing I wish is that I would have bought the D-460Z instead, as I really miss a zoom feature.  The digital zoom on the 360 is not worth using.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera!", "unixReviewTime": 971308800, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2000"}
