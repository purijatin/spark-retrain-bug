Paleologo \"gappy\"", "helpful": [52, 53], "reviewtext": "The little Olympus is an excellent digital camera for photo amateurs (like me and 99.99% of you). It's rightly considered excellent value for the price, for a number of reasons.Images: the quality of images ranges from  very good to acceptable. The resolution is high enough for album-size  prints, and for web posting. As far as I could tell, the optical group is  good (no distorsions and luminosity gaps).Usability: shooting commands  are very easy, although exposure correction and &quot;film&quot;  sensibility can take some time to set up. Nice features are the ability to  shoot sequences and to have wide/spot exposure meter. The &quot;macro&quot;  option works fine, but the &quot;2x&quot; option is almost worthless to me.  It's better to magnify the section of interest in the editing  phase.Built-in editing: the camera commands are also very easy to use  (you just have to keep the shutter closed). You can view your pictures on a  TV without needing a computer. You can zoom over a picture section. More  important, you can easily store/access/erase pictures, and the quality of  the LCD screen is good (brightness can be adjusted). Downoading images on a  PC/Mac is straightforward too. Overall, it took me less than one hour to  become aquainted with the camera proper.Now with the downsides. The  plastic case has a fragile silver finish which can be scratched too easily.  The camera consumes a lot of power, but life can be extended by keeping the  LCD off, although it is tempting not to. Finally, for a total extra cost of  $50, I would advise you to buy a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a  charger (NOT Olympus: too expensive) and an additional 16Mb+ smartmedia  card (also usable of Rio and other MP3 players).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "excellent camera", "unixReviewTime": 959904000, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2000"}
