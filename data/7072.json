Its weaknesses:  1) eats batteries for lunch, 2) serial interface is rather slow, 3) setup requires that you read the manual (and you'll need to read it again when you want to delete all your pictures after you download).  Valuable options:  The AC-power pack and a 32mb memory card.  Do you really need a 3-megapixel zoom for $?  Are you an avid shutter bug?  No?  Then consider this camera in the $ range.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great camera if you find it at a reasonable price", "unixReviewTime": 1042502400, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2003"}
