Edwards", "helpful": [46, 46], "reviewtext": "I've had the D360L for about two weeks and have been snapping everything -- so far I've been *VERY* pleased with the resulting images.  I also bought the standalone mediacard reader; it installed on my PC like a champ  with absolutely no problems.  Together the two components make for a great  experience!  Even the 8meg card that comes with the camera seems roomy  enough for the kinds of web images that I want to mostly make.  My only  criticism is that there is a considerable delay from when you push the  button until the picture is actually taken -- but I see this same phenomena  with other cameras (both film and digital); it seems to have more to do  with focusing and red-eye reduction than anything else.  (The later can be  disabled).  All in all, I'm very pleased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great unit, no major knocks", "unixReviewTime": 956016000, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2000"}
