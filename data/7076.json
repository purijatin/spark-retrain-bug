It's  almost impossible to take a bad photo with it, and it's great not having to  wait for a photo-processing lab before seeing the photos.I'm an American  currently living and working in London, England. I bought an Olympus  Camedia D-360L before I left home, and I've been sending photos of my  adventures along with a daily email newsletter to my friends, family, and  co-workers back at the US office.Nearly everyone has commented on the  clarity and sharpness of the photo attachments, and at work, the number of  subscribers to my Daily UK Newsletter list has swelled.I just love this  camera!!!! It's small enough to slip in a jacket pocket and take  sightseeing, and the photo editing software features help turn even  mediocre shots into good photos.My only criticism is that the included  Camedia photo-editing software is pretty unstable on Windows 98. I'm  running a laptop with 96 MB of memory, and find that the Camedia program  crashes frequently while using the Rotate and Filter-&gt;Brightness  features, leaving an alert dialog that won't go away unless I reboot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best camera I've ever owned!", "unixReviewTime": 965692800, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2000"}
