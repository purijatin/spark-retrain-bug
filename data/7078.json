Wilkening \"swimmer13\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "This camera is a good entry level camera, but leaves much to be desired. First, it eat batteries, forcing you to ...rechargeable bateries and a adapter for use when downloading images. 2nd, the camera has no optical zoom, forcing you to use the digital (and the LCD screen which drains batteries.) My third gripe about the camera is that the button for the LCD screen is resecced so it won't get turned on accidentaly, but the button makes it very, very, very dificult to turn on. I reapeatadly find my self stuggling to turn on the LCD screen. My 4th and final gripe is that it has no USB connection with the package. With the serial connection, it can take me 3 or 4 hours to donwload 20 or so pictures. I would suggest buying a memory card reader.... So, this is a good entry level camera, but not much else.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good and Bad", "unixReviewTime": 995673600, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2001"}
