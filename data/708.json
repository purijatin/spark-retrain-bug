The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook.  The top left elastic strap does (minorly) interfere with the operation of the on switch.  It doesn't really bother me all that much though.  I have had mine for a week or two now, and it still has a chemical smell to it.  Be prepared to let it air out for a while.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not quite a Moleskine", "unixReviewTime": 1280620800, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2010"}
