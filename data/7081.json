Fortunately the warranty was still in effect (1 yr). Tech support guys were were courteous and helpful, but customer support was not - something Olympus needs to be aware of (customer service rep was rude, also emails never returned). Colors in photos are very bold and bright.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun Camera", "unixReviewTime": 982627200, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2001"}
