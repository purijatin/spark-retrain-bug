This takes terrific pictures (you see the results right away), and if you're not happy with the result, just erase and take another picture!  This camera is lightweight, and easily fits in a pocket or a fanny pack.  It does use a lot of battery power, so buy some rechargeable batteries with your purchase.  I have an old HP color Deskjet printer, and the photos I print are good enough to put in my albums at 5x7&quot; size, 8x11&quot; pictures print kind of grainy- but I don't use the high resolution setting on the camera.The instruction manual is easy to navigate and simple to follow, I carry it with me on vacations to review how to take panoramic photos (these print beautifully!), or how to set the red-eye reduction.One word of caution, always use the wrist-strap when handling the camera.  I dropped my camera once on vacation, photos taken after that were too dark to see.  I sent the camera back for service to Olympus, and they were fantastic!  I had the camera returned within 3 weeks, and I could track the progress of my repair online at the Olympus website.  If I ever feel the need for a new digital camera, it will definitely be an Olympus!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is the first item I pack for vacations!", "unixReviewTime": 1010448000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2002"}
