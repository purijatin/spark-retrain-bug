At 1.3MP, the quality of images is much better than what I achieved on modern 10MP cameras. This was absolutely fantastic camera - the sliding door cover was extremely useful and rugged, user menues were very intuitive and responsive, the focus rocker was very precise. I dragged this camera on many outdoor trips...many times it tumbled, was dropped in sand...but in the end it always came back to life. Ultimately after the camera broke I searched for a replacement, but unfortunately Olympus never followed up with anything as good. Since then I moved on to Canon, Panasonic and Nikon cameras. I briefly went returned to Olympus for the 790 series. While I liked the rugged features, the limited photo options and poor image quality didn't impress me. Hope Olympus pull their act together and brings a camera worthy of its D-460 heritage.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Terrific Camera.
