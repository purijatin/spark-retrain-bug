I've been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera.  I use a variety of digital cameras at work and know  how useful they are.  This one had the price that I wanted to pay and the  performance of $1000+ cameras from a couple of years ago.  The colors look  great.  The software is a breeze to use.  The quality of the camera seems  to be very good so far.I would have scored this camera 5 out of 5 if it  came with a case and a USB connector.  It is slow to download with the  serial cable.  I still haven't been able to take any good photos at night:  firework displays, city lights, full moon, etc.I'm planning on  purchasing a case, a 32 MB Flash Card and a USB Reader.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice camera: convenient, easy to use, great photos", "unixReviewTime": 964483200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2000"}
