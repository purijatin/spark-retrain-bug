The zoom capability is great and the pictures are really sharp.I was really concerned about battery life because I had heard that batteries get drained really quickly with digital cameras.  I've taken over 100 pictures using Rayovac rechargeable batteries and the battery meter is still on full.  I only use the LCD screen to display pictures I've taken.  I use the viewfinder when taking pictures.The only negatives are that you have to manually lift the flash when taking flash pictures and that the camera does not use USB.  I was debating whether to buy an external USB reader when buying the camera, but the serial interface is sufficient for me for the time being.Overall, I've been thrilled with the camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Camera!", "unixReviewTime": 977529600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2000"}
