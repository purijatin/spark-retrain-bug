Picture quality is very nice, and the camera itself is easy to use.My only gripe is the battery cover.  Because of where it is and the direction it slides (and the fact that the batteries are literally spring-loaded projectiles), it's really easy to bump or grab the camera so that the battery compartment springs open, spilling the batteries and requiring you to re-enter the time and date (if you do).  Many times I've pulled the camera out, only to fumble with getting the batteries back into it.Other than that, I love it!  Oh, and I'd recommend getting a USB reader for the memory.  I didn't think that waiting for the serial download would be that big of a deal, but it gets irksome.  A larger memory card would be a long wait.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Only one gripe", "unixReviewTime": 1002499200, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2001"}
