I have owned my Olympus for about 2 years and have yet to have the first problem with it. Like any electronic device, getting the feel of it takes time and practice. But I carry it with me most always, use recharchable batteries, upgraded to higher smartmedia storage cards, and bought a basic USB card reader (mounted to my computer with velcro) to upload my pics. It's fast and the software is easy to use. This camera is a good buy/value and I will be using it for many more years to come.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Olympus D-460 still a great deal.", "unixReviewTime": 1036800000, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2002"}
