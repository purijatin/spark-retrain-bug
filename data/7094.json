Then the tiny Canon digital camera came out.. so I sold the D-340 and bought the Canon digital camera. While it was nice and small, it didn't take the quality of pictures that the Olympus did, nor did it fit the hand right.  I sold the Canon digital camera and bought this one in January of 2001.  I also bought some rechargeable 2AA batteries at the same time and finally had to use them.  The batteries that come with the camera (lithium, I believe) JUST died this January (2002)!  I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera! (Maybe thousands!)  Anyhow, the camera is designed to fit your hand. The size is about what a normal camera might be. If I had a bigger purse, it would probably fit.  I just bought a small digital camera bag for it. I can toss in the battery charger, etc. I like the quality of the zoom. The only thing that I don't care for is that the flash has to be flipped up in order to use it.  I guess this is good and bad.  Good because if you DON'T want to use flash for a picture, just don't flip it up (less having to do with settings, etc.). Bad, though, in case you forget to flip it up when you need the flash.  All in all, I will definitely stick with the Olympus brand for digital cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1012780800, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2002"}
