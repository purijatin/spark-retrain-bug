It has held up beautifully despite my lack of carrying case and my tendency to just throw it in the car, in a backpack, etc.  The exterior is scratched due to my carelessness, but the camera still takes terrific quality photos.  I have had momentary pangs of jealousy when I see the sleek, pretty little cameras that are on the market now, but I have no reason to replace my Olympus, as it works so well.  It's like the watch in those old commercials- it takes a lickin, but keeps on tickin!  FABULOUS value and you won't be disappointed if you buy this model.Update: January 2010.  Local retailers have replaced photo printing machines and the new ones do not have slots for this camera's smart card.  DH has pointed out that we can transfer photos onto a usb stick and bring that to the store, but this involves an extra step that I really don't need.  Maybe it is time to invest in a newer model.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still love it after many years!", "unixReviewTime": 1228262400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2008"}
