I wanted a megapixel device that was compact, simple to operate, but with a few advanced features (macro, timer, etc) so that I could completely replace my Olympus SLR zoom film camera. The best deal was at........ south of midtown, for the D460zoom. This camera has a nice menu-driven LCD interface in addition to the top-mount traditional LCD &quot;frame counter&quot; display, so you can use it for snapshots or serious framed-in, carefully composed recordings. I use the HiRes mode exclusively, with a 32Mb flash card. It's a dream come true -- I no longer need to use a film camera at all. I can print photo-quality 8x10s on my Mac and HP Desckjet 970Cse for less than the cost of prints. Now I'd like to find a flash-card printer that also can display on a TV.
