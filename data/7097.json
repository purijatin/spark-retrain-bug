It's everything other reviewers (whom I read carefully before buying...) say and more.  Yea, compact size.  Yea, feature packed.  Yea, yea.  But those PICTURES!!! I've never seen such clarity!  Even in max zoom mode this camera continues to astonish me.  I've printed out pictures of my grandson on photo inkjet paper to pass out to friends and relatives, and they think I'm lying when I tell them it's an inkjet print from a digital camera.  I like that.A lot.True, you're going to NEED the optional AC adapter, but only for uploading to your computer.. standard alkaline batteries work just fine and last a long time for picture taking.  And I've seen the difference between the 460 and ANY of the Sony junk.. no comparison.  Olympus wins on picture quality hands-down.  No contest. That Macro feature for close-ups... what a hoot!  It's great! Professional quality! You gotta get this camera if you're thinking digital.
