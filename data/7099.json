Its classical, Stylus-like design is attractive and functional. It is well made, well-balanced in the hand, and has intuitive controls and menus. It features 'burst mode' shooting (great for sports events, etc), superior optics, a great 3x (plus 2x digital) zoom and USB transfer (though only a memory card reader will make you love the simplicity of digital cameras). The included 8 meg SmartMedia card will handle about 100 480 X 640 pics, and larger cards are easily found and reasonably priced. The 1.2 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for everything from emails to printing 5 x 7s. The flash, battery life and software are acceptable. The price is a real bargain and makes this the #1 mid level digital camera at this time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best mid level digital camera deal.", "unixReviewTime": 993859200, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2001"}
