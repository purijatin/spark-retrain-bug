It was especially useful when our baby was born recently. We live in New York and have no familly here so I took a lot of pictures that were emailed to family and friends around the world. We received many compliments on the quality of the pictures.So I am now very very happy with the camera and rate it 5 stars plus. It is simple to use and easy to pop into a small bag and carry around with you. In the past few months it has travelled with me constantly. Although I bought this camera for my wife I found that I also used it a lot...so I bought another one! My poor Nikon SLR system hasn't seen the light of day for months!A great camera!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "update from my feb 21 review - perfection has been achieved", "unixReviewTime": 995328000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2001"}
