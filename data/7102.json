However I decided to spend a few more dollars and get the 460 because the zoom was more useful than just a point and shoot. I wasn't  disappointed, besides taking the same great pictures, the controls are more  ergonomically arranged, and has a few more bells and whistles.  The  only down side that I can find with the camera is turning it off. You must  be careful not to hit the lens barrel with the lens cover when sliding it  back.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in  something a cut above a basic point and shoot camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much better than I expected", "unixReviewTime": 962236800, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2000"}
