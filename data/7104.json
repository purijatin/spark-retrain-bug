Under the D450 reviews, several users recommend getting a flashpath floppy adapter and NiMH rechargable batteries  (these accessories are also compatible with the D460). In reading the  separate reviews for the Olympus brand products, several reviewer suggest  buying non-Olympus products since they are both less expensive and have  more features. The reviewers don't mention where to find these  products.If you are considering non-Olympus products, with your favorite  search engine... for the fastpath use &quot;flashpath and smartmedia&quot;  (since there are three types of flashpath standards, &quot;smartmedia&quot;  is what Olympus uses). For the NiMH batteries use &quot;MAHA MH-C204F&quot;  (the very informative battery review had accidentially transposed the last  two digits, which yields no hits).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Accessories to get more from your D460", "unixReviewTime": 956102400, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2000"}
