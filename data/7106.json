One person commented that it took him 15 minutes  to figure out the camera battery flap which he ended up breaking.  Without  reading the manual it took me no time at all to install 4 AA batteries and  I had the camera up and running immediately without a hitch - or breaking  anything.  There was nothing wrong with my remote control or the battery,  and camera view finder works as it should.  The one very minor flaw is that  if you power up the camera with the lens cap over the lens, the zoom lens  tries to push outward causing the a grinding sound.  Its happend to me a  couple times but didn't cause any damage and I'm more careful now to take  the lens cap off before powering up the camera.This camera is awesome!  Others have written about its many featues and superb picture quality.  I  especially like the bonus of being able to make QuickTime videos.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding Camera.
