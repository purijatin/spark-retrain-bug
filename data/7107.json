It was my replacement for the D600L from Olympus.Negatives:  not many.  My biggest pet peeve is the battery low indicator is not as accurate as I'd like.  The camera actually begins to lose functionality long before low battery is displayed.  And the camera goes downhill very quickly.  But the symptoms are more like the camera has lost some functionality and not others (inability to zoom but still able to focus).  I've just become used to replacing the battteries as soon as I start having any strange issues.Its not as small as I'd like.  The D200L was a great size for a camera.  This one is still too big for my liking.  I'd like to have something that really does fit in my pocket (like the size of my cellular phone would be good.Positives:  Get the 32Mb memory card and you can take photos for  what seems like forever!Superb low-light capability, good focus, excellent color, fantastic resolution.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "still working fairly well after a year", "unixReviewTime": 1006041600, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2001"}
