It takes good pictures in a variety of lighting situations. It has two problems; the first is that darn lens cap gets lost easily, the second is that the view through the viewfinder (not the LCD display) doesn't accurately represent the frame. Both can be solved (one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice) but they detract from an otherwise excellent product. I also like the ability to record a short audio segment on each picture, this is enough to describe the scene so that I can remember it later (try to remember everyone at your wedding for example!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Real camera, couple of gotchas", "unixReviewTime": 972691200, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2000"}
