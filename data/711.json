You will find \"the best ever\" in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best for those iPad lovers who eager to write something", "unixReviewTime": 1290988800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2010"}
