A knob would be a  much better way to handle this and some other settings.  I also personally  am a retro guy and would lose the motorized stuff, a nice lever would  suffice and save the batteries.  Same thing for flash, it goes off unless  you turn it off via a menu, and that can ruin a natual light picture if you  forget.  Too much automatic stuff for me to really feel &quot;as one&quot;  with this thing, but it does take outstanding pictures.The pictures are  very good with this camera.  Software good, and with a big memory chip it  holds tons of pictures.  Have not tried the movie feature, but a small  speaker or headphone jack would be nice if you did this more than  occassionally.  Also the need to take off the lens cap to avoid motor/gear  damage upon powerup is a annoyance that might be costly to the  operator.S", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good, some annoyances", "unixReviewTime": 969321600, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2000"}
