It allows for many pixel  compressions of jpeg files, all of which are fine quality.  In the 1st 3  weeks, I have taken over 1,000 photos of nature, travel, people, and  objects.  It uses smartcards which are smaller than a matchbook cover and  the 32 meg smartcard allows 330 photos on the SQ2 down to 40 on the HQ  compression. I print on a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet 60R and the quality is  very close to 35mm enlargements from a color lab. I recommend using the  rechargeable batteries since they last many hours then take a quick  recharge.I intend to use this camera to photograph mushrooms in our  forests this August and have total confidence in it. The macro button  allows the lens to be within inches of the subject, and with both manual  and digital zoom enabled, the subject fills the view.  The lens is fast  enough to use in dim light, but the flash is there when you need it.  The  accompanying software is easy to install, easy to use.Caveats: it is  very complex and the accompanying manual is essential. I refer to the  manual daily.  Also, I find it hard to get accustomed to the shutter delay  of a digital cameras after using a Canon A-1 SLR for all these years.  I  should mention that  the 1 1/2 inch LCD monitor cannot be seen when in  direct sunlight, although is perfectly visible when in shadows.  The  biggest flaw is the lens cap which MUST be removed before power is turned  on, and CANNOT be in place while power is on, a very odd flaw, Olympus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm a convert to digital and Olympus", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
