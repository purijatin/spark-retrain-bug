The pictures are incredible..I'd certainly NOT get anything cheaper if I was starting out, the price has come down so much.  There are now clearly better cameras but for the novice this is excellent.  Great flash.Buy more memory, it's cheap.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this camera", "unixReviewTime": 1006128000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2001"}
