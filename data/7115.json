In the end, I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature. (I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family.) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures. Family picture takers will like this camera. It takes great pictures, easy to transfer using USB, and comes bundled with great software. The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible. It is relatively easy to use, but I have not mastered making quick changes yet. A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor. Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes. You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features. They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user...If you are buying this camera, you should also get extra memory and batteries. You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter. I haven't tried rechargeables yet, but that may be my next purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great camera", "unixReviewTime": 976320000, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2000"}
