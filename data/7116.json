After looking at all the reviews I bought the Olympus 3030 Zoom.  Since the new 3040 had just come out (F 1.8 lens compared to the F 2.8 lens on the 3030) the price had dropped dramatically.  I'm amazed by the quality of the pictures that this camera takes.  Even in extremely low light circumstances, I can turn of the flash and get beautiful natural light pictures.  I can only imagine what the F 1.8 lens on the new 3040 model would do!  The menu is easy to use and the camera is delighlfully small.  Manual settings are easy to adjust, but the auto setting mode is dead-on except for difficult shots like those with backlighting.  The video mode also works great and captures both video and sound for short periods (200 seconds on a 64 mb card at HQ resolution).  This is a great camera and the price is also great.  The only downside is a lens cap that is not engineered to stay on the lens....buy a tether unless you want to keep replacing it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Camera...Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 997142400, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2001"}
