I paid a lot more for it and I still think that it is worth it.The pictures are really more clear than compared to regular cameras and even better than the SONY digital ones.But do buy more Nickel Metal batteries and more memory. You will need it. The 64MB cards holds 81 pics HD mode. Alkaline batteries are useless and drain after 3-5 pics at best. Lithium are not rechargeable. The standard memory on this mode is good for about 20 pics.If you pics is too dark, it also comes with software for you edit the pics. You can zoom in the editing the pics to any size you want. All the features that you dream of and more.If there is a upgrade to the lense to view further, I will buy it too.Best tech/picture taking toy out there.- Will", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Camera", "unixReviewTime": 992563200, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2001"}
