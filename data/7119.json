It's so small I can take it everywhere--and I do. With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.  But spending some time to get to know the camera really unlocks its full potential.If you want an excellent digital camera, with excellent image quality, easy to use default settings, and advanced features for even more flexibility, the C3030 is the one to get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything I wanted", "unixReviewTime": 976924800, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2000"}
