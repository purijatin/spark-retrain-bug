It also has the feature that turns on the iPad when the cover is opened.The Moleskin does have a very nice, luxurious feel.For me, it was just too heavy.  Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.There is another iPad cover sold on Amazon that is a big seller, at around $20+, made of a synthetic material.  It is much lighter, and also turns on when opened.I hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting, but this Moleskin cover was just too tiring for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Well Made Product, But....", "unixReviewTime": 1324080000, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2011"}
