With both cameras, many indoor shots had be be &quot;doctored&quot; in Adobe Photoshop.  Levels need to be adjusted and then the photos are just great. Outdoor shots are great.  I did notice that battery life with the 3030 was considerably more than that of the 460. Rechargeable batteries are essential with any digital camera!  I really like the &quot;movie with sound&quot; function of the 3030.  Smart media reader buyers - beware if you have an AMD processor.  After much research I have found that a Pentium processor is essential and your reader may not work with an AMD. Camera appearance very professional looking.  For the true photographer, this camera is a must.  For the amateur the 460 works quite nicely.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Honest Opinion", "unixReviewTime": 971654400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2000"}
