I compared sound specs, video specs, and DTS capability.  You don't need to know one piece of technical info to understnad my review.I went to a local store and looked at five units between 199 and 350 dollars.  This RV-30 offered as much as any at the best price.  I even asked a kid at (a stoor) what the real difference was.  He said he could have bought any one but got this one because it was the best.I bought it and use it daily.  [wasn't supposed to open it until xmas].  Super picture quality and easy to use.  Not one draw back at all.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No wonder its sold out!!", "unixReviewTime": 976233600, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2000"}
