Purports to play VCD, but this is pointless since it can't play CDR.Most frustrating part of this unit is the time lag between power on and tray opening. Should take one second, but wastes about ten.Remote control is poorly designed and you'll be forced to turn on the lights to find any button.  Multiple angle DVDs are very frustrating to use.  Changing angles requires more than one button push.My Apex cost half as much and has many more features.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointment", "unixReviewTime": 1036368000, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2002"}
