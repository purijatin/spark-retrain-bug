I didn't expect to be able to really use it since I'm a housewife and didn't see the need for it. Boy was I wrong.If you use a paper planner, you need to consider using a palm. I downloaded a few programs that I thought would help me and now my life is in my palm.- I track my children's growth and medication and shots, when I go to the dr's office, I'm never without dates, medical history, dosage of medicines etc.- I have reminders for birthdays, anniversaries, appts. etc.- I have a shopping list. No more guessing when I run into the grocery store. No more forgetting that one item I always forget.- I can track my finances and budget and unfortunately for me, no longer have an excuse for not living within my budget. (sigh).- I track presents I need to buy and presents I have bought, I track clothes sizes and clothes I need and I can play games. I can do almost anything on my palm.This is a product well worth having.You can read all about memory etc. in other reviews and product information. Let me just say that I have downloaded and downloaded and added programs and have yet to run out of memory. I have not had a problem with battery usage (and I use this a lot for long periods of time (playing games- shhh)). I have even dropped this on the cement, with no case, and it survived. WOW!Well worth the money!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Useful!", "unixReviewTime": 1014422400, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2002"}
