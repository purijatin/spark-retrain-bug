This is the best value for your money in a PDA.  Its far more economical than the Vx or even V for that matter. I personally  like the looks of the IIIxe over that of the V series especially since the  IIIxe is jet black(versus the onlder III models with the gray case). The  case also seems more rugged and sturdy than the Visor series. Buy this!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product!", "unixReviewTime": 966297600, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2000"}
