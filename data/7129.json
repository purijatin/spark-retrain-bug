I use outlook to keep track with my contacts and my schedules. So Transfering my data is like watching TV. You don't have to do anything but sync.I also keep a copy of important mails in my palm with Eudora. Again, it works great. I also use it to do a lot of readings while I travel / have nothing better to do.The back light works greater than I'd expected. It just feel like a black and white LCD screen in front of you.....and I spent my time playing tetris on it during my probability and statistics class. :)Just get it. It's worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use, handles great, solid display in the dark", "unixReviewTime": 982195200, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2001"}
