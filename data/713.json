I was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines. Quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with. The cover holds the iPad in a fairly but not definitely snug manner.It is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the iPad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side. No big deal for a right handed person.A note to Moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite \"go kiss-off\". A better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly, less smug company.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fair at Best", "unixReviewTime": 1360972800, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2013"}
