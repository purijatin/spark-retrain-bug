Adams \"bhadams1\"", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewtext": "If against using rechargable batteries and only want daily planner with some ebooks, games and/or third-party software, this one is for you.  Out of all of products available, at the time, Palm IIIxe is the best.The batteries (2x AAAs) will last you about a month.  On you first day, it'd probably last you the day until the newest wears off.I used the IIIxe mostly as a stand alone, which means I didn't use my PC to HotSync (maybe a few times).  And I rarely had any problems; the only problems I'd encountered was from bad third-party software.  I never had to hard reset.You can go to Palm's website to download the Palm OS 4.1 upgrade, which I recommend if you plan on using some of newer  third-party software.So if you don't want much, but an inexpensive Palm OS PDA that waste batteries instead of electricity, with enough memory to do what your daily planner could do, and play games like Monopoly and Solitaire, and read ebooks, then this is the ideal purchase for you.Or you go with a new Palm Zire/Zire21 for less than $100.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great For Those Who Don't Want Too Much", "unixReviewTime": 1073779200, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2004"}
