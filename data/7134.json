For instance, an essay is assigned in english.  I can type it up on the keyboard accessory and print it out when I get home.  Then I can relax when  I get home instead of worrying about work due the next day.  The To do list  also replaces my paper agenda and is a very nice feature allowing you to  check off items upon completion.  What can I say?  The Palm IIIxe saves a  ton of time plus it's fun in study hall playing games with others that have  one.  I love the infra red port.  I used to have the IIIe and this is a  much better model allowing me to put in a ton more programs.  An ingenious  device.  I can't think of going back to the old way of using paper anymore.  Palm is definately a must have.  You won't regret purchasing one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceptional time saver", "unixReviewTime": 953769600, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2000"}
