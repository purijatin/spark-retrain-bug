Get one of  these Palm 3xe's.  One button and it's on ready to serve you whatever  information you want.I find the calendar, phone organizer, and task  lists essential tools.  My only complaint is my Outlook categories do not  get down loaded with the data.  So you have a choice.  Do you want the  categories on your desktop system or on the Palm?  I choose to leave the  &quot;task&quot; categories on the Palm 3xe and the &quot;contacts&quot;  categories on the desktop system.  It makes it harder to find some  information if you are used to using categories and don't have them.  I am  still looking for software that will fix this problem.  If you know where I  can get this let me know.It took me only a few minutes to nail down the  graffiti stylus motion to insert text.  A little game &quot;Giraffe&quot;  is included to help you learn. Play it for 30 minutes and you have it  down.This Palm device has plenty of memory and the optional accessories  are reasonably priced.I chose this over the Handspring, because it had  the capability of upgrading the Operating System and I didn't see the need  to add on cards.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AMAZING Device!  I love it.", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
