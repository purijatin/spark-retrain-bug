I was so used to using a calender, another electronic organizer and good ole paper to keep track of my everyday work.  Since purchasing the palm IIIxe, my life has been  simplified.  It is so easy to use and its compact size makes it easy to  take around wherever you go.  What is really impressive is the ease of the  Palm's menu.  You literally just tap the screen on an application you want  to use.  The graffiti feature takes some practice but once you've gotten  used to it, it's a breeze.  I especially enjoy using the hot sync to  download my e-mail for later viewing.  Entering information in the address  and date book is fast using the accompanying software on your home or  office PC.  You just type in the information and hot sync it to your Palm  with little effort.  I think that anyone considering to purchase a Palm PDA  should consider the IIIxe.  It has a generous 8MB or RAM, twice as much as  the IIIx as well as some added new features.  I contemplated purchasing the  IIIc because of its color feature but later changed my mind.  I could not  justify paying an additional $200 for the color feature.  The IIIxe gives  you the most bang for the buck.  I highly recommend this item for those  seriously considering purchasing a PDA and to to purchase it from  Amazon.com.  They were the only ones who have it in stock and it arrived at  my door after only two days of placing the order.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It Was Love At First Tap", "unixReviewTime": 954028800, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2000"}
