If you are at all interested in going beyond the basic calender, address books, note pad functions, then get the models with the extra memory. Vindigo (free Zagat restaurant and updated movie listings) and AvantGo (free newspapers and magazines in electronic formats) will use the space and take your palm experience to a whole new level. If you live in a major city, Vindigo alone makes it worth owning a Palm.So why IIIx over Palm Vx?1. No difference in funcitonality (at all)2. Significantly cheaper (w/rebate)3. More case options for III4. More attachments for III5. Coolness factor dwindles quickly6. We'll probably all be replacing these on 12 mos for ones that have big MP3 players attached, why spend more now?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If I had to do it again...", "unixReviewTime": 976060800, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2000"}
