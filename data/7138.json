Schlesinger", "helpful": [17, 18], "reviewtext": "First off, Palm finally has the 8DRAM patch for the IIIxe, and even though  my unit was infected, I've had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.In fact, this  machine has far exceeded my expectations.  I found it very easy to learn  the &quot;graffiti&quot; handwriting (and even easier if you download a  &quot;hack&quot; like Middlecaps.)  More importantly, the freeware and  shareware applications that I've downloaded (e.g., a more powerful  calculator, pop-up &quot;bug me&quot; notes, a spreadsheet, a document  reader, a customizable application launcher, and yes, even a few games)  have turned my IIIxe into much more than an organizer -- it's truly a  minicomputer!  Fortunately, the IIIxe has 8MB of RAM to store all this  stuff -- I wouldn't buy one with less memory.Also, Palm's customer  support is great.  When I had trouble syncing the first time, they walked  me through the process and quickly solved the problem (the unit defaults to  sync via modem instead of a direct serial connection -- kinda dumb since  most people will sync right at their computer.)A great machine for the  price, and there's still a LOT more I can do with it.  (P.S.  If you live  in Boston, San Fran, NY, Chicago or D.C., I highly recommend downloading  &quot;Vindigo&quot; to your Palm.  Type in your location or destination and  it gives you the best places to eat and be entertained -- current movie  listings, restaurant reviews from Zagat, etc.  And it updates automatically  when you sync your Palm to your PC.  A great app that makes the Palm that  much better!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much more than an organizer!", "unixReviewTime": 964656000, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2000"}
