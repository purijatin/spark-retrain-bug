I was always thinking of a Windows CE handheld computer and never paid much attention to Palm computers. Then, one day, just a month ago, I bought the Palm IIIe (because it was  affordable: $149) thinking that I was just getting a &quot;monochromatic  electronic organizer&quot; in the meantime (unlike a full-color Windows CE,  etc.), but to my surprise I had a little powerful computer! I was hooked in  less than one day and I even bought the PalmPilot book by David Pogue.  Two  weeks later, browsing the Net, I saw the newest model, the Palm IIIxe, and  comparing the features I ordered it immediately. What I like about the Palm  IIIxe, just to mention a few things, is its 8MB of memory (which in the  Palm OS world is really A LOT), the upgradable operating system (unlike the  Palm IIIe), the 2 AAA batteries that last on average 3 weeks if you use  your Palm a lot, thousands of programs to download and of course the  one-button sync with my PC.  Other than the basic functions, I use it as a  database browser, dictionary, quick reference for book titles and URLs I  keep jotting down, my repository of ideas (including small sketches),  financial calculator and to download customized channels from the Web to  read later on. In my wish list, dear Palm Engineers, there is only one  thing: This wonderful handheld computer with the screen resolution and  sharpness of the E-Book.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Buy it.
