It's not color which I don't care about, but I am having a bit of a hard time seeing the screen well.  I have had a terrible time getting it to synch correctly with Outlook and I couldn't get it to synch at all with Palm Desktop 3.5.3.  No clue what the problem is, but after 2 hours trying to figure it out, I just gave up.  I use Outlook Express, not Outlook and it took a lot of trial and error, but I can get it to synch names and addresses, but I can NOT get email to work since i don't use Outlook as my default mail handler.  So..if that fits your situation and you want to synch for email and download from AVantgo, then do not buy this.  However, I just want it for names and addresses to replace an old trusty Sharp Wizard that they don't make anymore.  I really loved my Sharp though.  What i like about the Palm IIIxe is that it's battery-operated (2 AAAs)- i honestly don't even fathom why people complain about this feature - they're nuts.  The battery operated PDAs are the way to go because they can last forever in your purse and you don't have to remember to charge it.  If the battery is dead while you're on the go - just run to a convenience store and buy AAAs.  That simple.  The Palm IIIxe seems pretty sturdy, but we'll see in the long run.  Either with Palm or Sharp, this beats carrying around a paper and pencil organizer.  The person I bought from on Amazon was great and honest too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality But No Frills PDA", "unixReviewTime": 1109030400, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2005"}
