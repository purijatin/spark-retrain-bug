I could talk a lot about the wonderful features and conveniences the replacement palm has added to my life, but I want to talk about my great experience with Palm's customer service department.  The other Amazon reviewers can talk about how wonderful it is to own a palm pilot.The first palm I purchased had something seriously wrong with it.  I was getting numerous error messages and system failures that required that I repeatedly reset my palm, losing my data and everything.  Ugh.  I called Palm and they walked me through a thorough series of tests to try and fix it.  My call was handled quickly and efficiently, but with patience and concern on the part of the service representative.  The end result was that I had a defective pilot, and they replaced it no questions asked.  I was not happy that I had a defective product at first, but with electronics that is unavoidable once in a while.  My new palm is humming along perfectly!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent customer service!", "unixReviewTime": 984528000, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2001"}
