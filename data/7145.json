Deciding that i wanted to go the Palm OS direction i had the choice of going with either the IIIxe or the Vx. Boasting roughly the same innards, the decision came down to form. Since i was willing to part with a little more money at that time i decided to go with the Vx. Let me say however that had i chosen the IIIxe i would not have been disappointed at all.Its a great Palm with upgradable OS. Something its Palm III brothers could not do.My only gripe with this Palm is that it is quite large. It is just as big as something i willing to carry in my pocket. Since i planned to bring my Palm with me where ever i go and i dont carry a bag, my pocket would have to be its main form of transportation. With an added case that would have made its overall size even bigger.Overall i really like this Palm. It has that classic look and is still one of the more powerful palms available. I would pick this over the m100's any day.As a last piece of advice i highly recommend that you do your research before you go and by any PDA. Dont believe the PocketPC ads or even the Palm ads. Talk to a lot of people and read a lot of reviews, particularly reviews that are made my people like you or me who aren't on Palm's or Microsoft's payroll.(Unfortunately) They will really tell you a lot of things that you will really want to know.Good Luck!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Last of the legendary and classic Palm III's", "unixReviewTime": 987897600, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2001"}
