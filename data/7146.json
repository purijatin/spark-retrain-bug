Levine", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewtext": "I purchsed my IIIxe almost a year ago, and compared against the V and VII it was the best bang for the buck at the time.  The 8 megs of memory means that you have the ability to load a ton of the ton of the third party software available for the Palm platform.  The screen was about the same quality as the V and VII, and those two models were a lot more expensive, required constant docking (in the case of the V), or had the additional expense of wireless internet (VII).However, that was a year ago.  Today, the IIIxe is still a good value, but having seen the screens on the IIIc and color Handspring unit, I would lean towards one of those two models.  There really is a night/day difference in eyestrain between a color unit and monochrome.Other than that, the IIIxe is still a great value, even though it lacks the Handspring expansion, and the Clie and Tiger's ability to add more flash RAM.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Used to be the best overall Palm.
