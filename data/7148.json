It sync's brilliantly with Yahoo! Calendar and the underrated Palm Desktop software.  The downloadable apps work great and the ability to play Pac Man or read the Wall Street Journal in a boring meeting almost justifies the purchase price alone.If you are on the road much or just out of the office, a Palm III is the right thing to own.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything I have ever hoped for in a PDA", "unixReviewTime": 984355200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2001"}
