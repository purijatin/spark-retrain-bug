Grafiti, the custom writing style, is good, but difficult for me due to poor fine-motor skills.  As such, a few letters require several repeats to get.  My wife is much better with the writing portion than I am.  I primarily use this for reminders, phonebook and notes.  Side use is multi-clocks for travelling, and various video games.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good price, good features", "unixReviewTime": 996796800, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2001"}
