Previously I used a planner and a sharp wizard. I wasn't sure just how much I would use the Palm, but it is now a part of my being! The IIIXE screen is larger than the Palm screen on the M105, the memory is the same, and I don't find the squared shape at all uncomfortable. I highly recommend a Palm to women ...it's easy to learn graffiti, and it leaves a heck of a lot of room in your purse (no more planner, or little scraps of notes). I use it constantly, from &quot;Handy Shopper&quot; to jog my memory for groceries and even sequence them by aisle (shopping in 1/4 the time because of fewer returns to the same section) -- to Avantgo internet surfing, freeing up the home internet for my son. I read books, I play games, I track all of my work stuff, and I keep better track of all my finances (actually recording all my debit card expenditures!). Balancing my checkbook is a snap. It can be an adult &quot;gameboy&quot; and a geek organizer as well as a library and reference tool. The software available is amazing and I find new uses almost daily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "better than the M105", "unixReviewTime": 984441600, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2001"}
