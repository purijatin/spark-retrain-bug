A testament to how much the technology has improved since I first held one of these things. In 1994 I sat down with an Apple Newton, and in a little under a half-hour I was ready to bounce it against a wall. The Palm IIIxe is a terrific product for what my wife and I plan to use them for.We're volunteers at the Minnesota Zoo and as such we interact directly with the public. With a pair of Palm IIIxe's we plan to download key zoo information on each animal and use it as a reminder when we're giving tours. They will also be filled with other information such as locations of emergency phones and numbers, restrooms and guest service desk locations. And as soon as I figure out how, maps of the entire site. Additionally, the screen is big enough to be read easily, and the back lit green will aid us in darker places of the zoo like the Minnesota Trail or the Coral Reef areas.This dynamite little unit weighs next to nothing and is easily tucked away when not in use. The 8mb of memory means that we can pack all sorts of zoo data, indexed to each animal, and other information into it. Plus it's so easy to use that there isn't any hassle to look up names, numbers or other data- the interface is simple and intuitive. Sure it's not as snazzy as the Cassio E-125 Pcoket PC, but then again it's less than half the price. If you want a PDA with enough bells and whistles to satisfy and not so much as to be overwhelming, then the IIIxe is probably the one you want.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Adult Toy, and it's useful, too!", "unixReviewTime": 988934400, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2001"}
