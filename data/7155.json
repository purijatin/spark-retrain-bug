Sturdy design and you feel like you've got something powerful in your hand when you use it.  Looks like something built to MIL specs - which is good.  The only 'flaw' was the graffiti took some getting use since it is an older version of the software - at least I imagine that is the issue.All-in-all .....great purchase and unit!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantasic Value !", "unixReviewTime": 1183939200, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2007"}
