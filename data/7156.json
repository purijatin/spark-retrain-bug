You're already an organized person. If you're the type who uses a datebook or  calendar, who answers their e-mail immediately and who keeps up to date  to-do lists, you'll find the Palm a godsend. You'll find yourself whipping  out the Palm during meetings to answer your e-mail, making notes for  grocery shopping and jotting down telephone numbers and addresses.2.  You're a gamer or technofreak. You'lllove the variety of software for the  Palm. You'll be playing SimCity (yes, there's a Palm version!), chess,  Galaxian and programming in FORTH, C and various Palm-specific  interpreters.3. You're a hardware hacker. The Palm is a great interface  for all sorts of experimentation.But if you buy the Palm thinking it'll  make you organized...nope, won't happen. Save your money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for the organized person...but...", "unixReviewTime": 958608000, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2000"}
