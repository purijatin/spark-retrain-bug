Before, he was a mess- Post it notes everywhere, scribbled notes on the back of envelopes, and overflowing address books. Now everything is inside his Palm Pilot-- it can hold thousands of addresses and memo notes, and it's easy to transfer data from your PC into your Palm with the included Hot Sync Cradle.The 8 MB is more than anyone could ever need, especially if it's only for every day use. It's easy to download games, maps, books and other software into your Palm from their website, and after many downloads, my dad still has plenty of room. The hard plastic case is also very durable, though I would recommend buying a carrying case for safety. And the stylus that comes with it is pretty flimsy, so I'd also recommmend adding another stylus to your purchase. If you want internet &amp; e-mail, you can buy the Palm OS add-on and you'll be hooked up in no time.Now that Amazon.com has reduced the price, the Palm IIIxe is even more of a great deal... and the only difference between the new Palm Vx and the Palm IIIxe is that the Palm Vx is thinner and it's silver. The Palm IIIxe has everything the Vx does, at a much lower price. It's simple, reliable, has tons of space... and it's perfect for anyone who wants to get organized, fast. Two Thumbs Up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Buy-- Palm IIIxe has everything you need &amp; more", "unixReviewTime": 980121600, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2001"}
