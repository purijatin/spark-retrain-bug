I should have shorted the crap out of Palm when I had a chance.  When the batteries (two AAA) are drained, you will lose all your data in the device!!!  Not only that, the lack of back light makes it difficult to read in an airplane, a dark conference room or in a dark restaurant.This device along with a very nice leather case will be donated to charity.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Battery drainer and no back light.", "unixReviewTime": 1370736000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2013"}
