It died earlier this month (RIP).  Even with only 1/2 Meg of ram, I never outgrew it.I am impressed with the storage capability of my new IIIxe.  The infrared is cool, since my family and coworkers also have Palms.  Although  the IIIxe is an upgrade in specifications, however, I liked the Personal  edition better; the Personal felt more durable and the screen didn't squish  under the stylus.I have heard a lot of reviews telling me that the new  IIIxe screen is so much clearer and higher contrast than the older models.  I think the new screen is much more difficult to read than my Personal  model.  I'm not so sure that I am satisfied with this new unit, but I've  become so  reliant on the Palm that I'll have to keep it.  I can't justify  the money for the color upgrade.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I miss my Palm Personal; IIIxe not as solid, screen lacks!", "unixReviewTime": 962236800, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2000"}
