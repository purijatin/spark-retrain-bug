The brightness and IPS performance so stunning. For Thailand friend, they send direct to your home and pay custom for 1700 B. Then this monitor is much cheaper than any 27 inch with same resolution selling in Thailand.Dr.PoonchaiBangkok, Thailand", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you love to read Magazine, I would like to recommend this great monitor", "unixReviewTime": 1393027200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2014"}
