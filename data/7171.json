Unless size is critical, I would definitely recommend the IIIc over the Vx, as the color makes it so much easier to read and so much more fun to play with.  The complaints you see about screen brightness are bogus.  The display is plenty bright and clear and easy to read in all situations except direct sunlight.  Perhaps the people criticizing screen brightness and image quality need to download Chrome and select a higher contrast color scheme, because I just can't understand what they're complaining about.  Other great free downloads include Vindigo and Avantgo.  If you travel, you will also love Travel Tracker, which I consider well worth the thirty bucks.  After barely two months, I can hardly even imagine life without my Palm, and that's pretty much the best recommendation I can think of.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Indispensible Toy", "unixReviewTime": 981763200, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2001"}
