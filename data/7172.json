It went on the blink, so I tried to buy another. No dice. I bought a IIIC instead. From day one, it barely worked. When I touch the stylus to a letter or number on the screen, it jumps to another letter or number or just won't work. The graffiti is very poor, with many repeat strokes for any letter. For data insertion, it is worthless. I only use it for playing chess now.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worst product I ever bought", "unixReviewTime": 998870400, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2001"}
