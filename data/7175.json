Marth \"jpmarth\"", "helpful": [12, 12], "reviewtext": "Of all the PDAs I have owned, this was the first with a color display.  You may have heard others say it before, and I will definately agree - once you go color you never go back.  I was impressed with the screens ability to display colors.  You might expect Palm's first try at a color screen to only be partially successful.  But, they did quite well.  While the screen may be lack the brightness to be easily read in bright sunlight.  It does allow for the use of the PDA when in a poorly lit room.  Which is the more common scenario.Unlike some of other previous Palm III models, the IIIc features 8mb of storage and an internal, reachargable battery.  I used this PDA on a daily basis for over a year and only noticed a very slight reduction in the battery's ability to hold a charge and I can not express how thrilled I was to no longer have to purchase batteries for my PDA.What did I not like?  Of course there is the fact that 5 months after the IIIc came out, Palm decided to release its new line of 500 series with SD/MMC slots.  Not as though I could have predicted it.  The IIIc also comes with an attached flip cover to protect your screen.  There is the option to remove the cover if you find it rather annoying.  Which I did.  Instead of the cover included, I would have preferred something closer to what the iPAQ used - a hard flip cover for the screen that allowed navigation with the buttons while still permitting the user to view the screen.If you are looking for a PDA with mulitmedia features, this is not the one for you.  If you want a PDA that is capable of holding documents, contact information, games, and can do so in color, then the IIIc will suit you quite well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First color PDA", "unixReviewTime": 1065052800, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2003"}
