Unfortunately, having used both the IIIc and the Vx, I'm underimpressed with the quality of the image on the IIIc.  It is colour, which is a pretty neat change to Palm's previous greyscale models, but I find it much more difficult to focus on the screen image.  It seems to flicker quite a bit, and gave me a headache after using it for an hour or so.  I found the screen on the Vx to be much more comfortable, especially if used for a long period of time.  The Palm operating system is wonderful, much easier to use, and more efficient, I feel, than Windows CE, but I'd go with one of the b&amp;w models for the time being. Also, the IIIc is much thicker and less stylish than the brushed aluminum case of the V series, which may be something you want to consider before purchasing this model.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Less than satisfactory display", "unixReviewTime": 977356800, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2000"}
