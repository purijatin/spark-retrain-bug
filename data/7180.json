The color screen is beautiful indoors and adequately readable even in bright sunlight when I turn my back to the sun. The OS could make even better use of color, but the OS is flash upgradable and a new version is rumored to be coming out soon.As with all Palms, it's operation is VERY intuitive. The synching with MS Outlook (called a conduit) was easy to install and works without problems. Very powerful organizer!I do my photo work and display on my home computer. If you're really wanting best quality photos, the IIIC would limit you with it's 256 colors and 8MB memory, and I suggest you look at a Pocket PC. (Some people have found the Prism hard to view for long periods of time--slow refresh rate?).The only reservation I have, which hopefully will not be a problem for several years, is that when the recharchable battery eventually dies, I'll have to send in the whole PDA.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great product at a good price", "unixReviewTime": 981158400, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2001"}
