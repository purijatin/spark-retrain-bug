I have not been disappointed. With the new low pricing of the IIIc, it sells for less than the Vx and, despite the added size, color is well worth it. Numerous color apps are now available and everything from the address book to games is clearer and more fun on the IIIc. The size is relly not an issue, as it is still much smaller than any CE device. The palm 3.5 OS is fast and is yet to crash on me. The device can become addicting and I would also recommend, as others have , obtaining the Chrome color adjusting software... which maximizes the screen and can save battery life if you convert to the black backround. The battery itself stays charged for about 3 days with heavy use before it bugs out. Overall, this is a super product for[the price]. One more thing; Palm will probably come out with a wireless device the size of the Vx with a color screen farely soon. However, I assure you such a device will cost more...and this IIIC will suffice very nicely until you need get your next &quot;fix&quot; fo a new gadget!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great and fun product", "unixReviewTime": 977616000, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2000"}
