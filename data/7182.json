I don't know how I ever got along without it.  I was going to buy a Vx but the resulting headache after using it for  about 5 minutes (and my wonderful wife) talked me into the great color  screen on the IIIc.The unit is lightweight, handsome, functional, and  very easy to use.  Installation and setup was &quot;Oh, so easy!&quot;  The  writing recognition isn't flawless but is very good.  Definitely better  than any Windows based apps I've used. It comes with 4 core applications  that will simplify your life...Date Book, Address Book, To-Do List, and  Memopad.  My wife can enter Honey-Do's into the Palm Windows software on my  home computer while I'm at work so when I get home and HOTSYNC the IIIc  there's no way I can forget to pick up the bread and milk!I keep the  Palm IIIc with me all the time.  There are many accessories to make the  Palm &quot;handy&quot; for you to carry but I'm using a velcro camera  carrying case that attaches to my belt and fits the IIIc like a  glove.There are thousands of third party applications you can download  off the internet.  My favorites are the ePocrates PDR, a physician's desk  reference and TotalcarC, to easily keep up with all maintenance and fuel  cost of all your vehicles.  If you wonder what you'd ever use a PDA for  just search the WWW for Palm software and you'll find more useful  applications than you'd ever had believed possible.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A very good product!", "unixReviewTime": 965260800, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2000"}
