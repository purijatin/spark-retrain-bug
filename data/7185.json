Within a year I decided to upgrade to add more memory and to explore color and Oh Wow!!!!!!!! What a difference! Now I wouldn't dream of going back to grayscale!!!!!!! My only wish is that it had the color intensity of the Handspring Prism and the wireless connectivity of the Palm VIIx. The Palm IIIc is a great product!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I COULDN'T IMAGINE OWNING GRAYSCALE AGAIN!", "unixReviewTime": 982800000, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2001"}
