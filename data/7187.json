Carry this pocket-sized keyboard to take notes at your next meeting or write reports on an airplane.  Folds down small. Weighing in at less than 8 ounces, this full-size keyboard folds  into a size just slightly bigger than a Palm handheld itself.  Use it  almost anywhere. Slip a Palm Portable Keyboard into your pocket to write  memos or plan your to-do's when you're away from your desk.  Customize  quick keys. Up to nine user-programmable keys let you instantly access the  applications and programs you use most.  Easy to use. Simply install the  Palm Portable Keyboard software, set your Palm handheld in the custom  docking cradle, and start typing.  No batteries required. It uses minimal  power from your Palm handheld, and no additional batteries are required.  Obviously a great deal easier than using that small keypad on the Palm  itself.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Palm Pilot Keyboard...Finally Typing Ease...", "unixReviewTime": 961891200, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2000"}
