Wait until you see it in person, you will be impressed twice as much.  It folds open, then the outer sections of the keys slide together to make a full sized keyboard.  Very  compact, very unique.  This definately gets the job done and is much better  than the LandWare GoType keyboard which I own as well.  The Palm Portable  is definatly worth spending the extra money on.  Get this keyboard.  You  will love it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressive", "unixReviewTime": 956188800, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2000"}
