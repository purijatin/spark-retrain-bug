Young", "helpful": [26, 27], "reviewtext": "The inventor's of the Palm Portable Keyboard have have developed an incredible accessory to the Palm PDA Platform.  You have got to see it and try it out to appreciate its marvel.  It literally is a full size keyboard  that folds up and is only slightly larger then the Palm PDA itself.  It  even comes in a nice carrying case.  Inputing information into your Palm is  a snap and I really appreciate not having to write, using the grafiti tool  to add information into my Palm.  If you use the Memo feature on your palm  to jot down some notes, type a lengthy memo, etc., this this keyboard is  for you.  Typing is a breeze and feels very natural as if you were typing  at your PC.  There are specific keys on the board that replace the need to  tap on a menu item to be called up.  I cannot emphasize the portability and  light weight of the keyboard and the uniqueness of how it folds up into  compact size.  If you are a regular user of your Palm PDA then this  keyboard is a must.  You will not regret spending the extra bucks in lieu  of convenience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Awesome Keyboard", "unixReviewTime": 958176000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2000"}
