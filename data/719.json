Meadows", "helpful": [0, 6], "reviewtext": "[[EDIT]]Now that I have upgraded my graphics card to a 2GB DDR5 card with a DVI-D port on it, the monitor gives me the full 1080p for movies and general resolution of 2560X1600. This was the problem. If you have a standard \"on board/integrated\" graphics card, then this monitor might not work for you.... you may not have a DVI-D port and it may not be able to support this hulk. On a different retail site, this company's recommendation was to have a minimum 1GB on your graphics card, and upgraded to a 2GB that is working quite well.I'm not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me. I have no complaints about the display.The monitor does run HOT though, which I think is typical for this style.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, unedited:It came with no English manual, and no DVDs for drivers.Windows is running mine with the generic driver. The best resolution I can get is 1280X800, which looks horrific.I'm aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card, but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p, and I cannot get even that. I actually can set it to 1080p, but I immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish.Can't get a setting for anything higher than 1080p, and definitely cannot actually use 1080p.I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this, especially if the seller is reading this. I'll bump this to 5 stars if they can help me resolve this (I will send an inquiry if I cannot get it fixed soon).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "MUST HAVE DVI-D port to get full resolution! Good monitor otherwise!", "unixReviewTime": 1394841600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2014"}
