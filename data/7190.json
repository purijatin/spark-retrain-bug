What I *will* add that no one yet  seems to have commented on yet is the ultimate COOLNESS factor...take this  keyboard out, pop it open, and I guarantee your tech-head friends will be  oohing and ahhing over its elegant and innovative design, compact size, and  sleek shape...and when they see it *work* as smoothly and easily as it does,  they'll want one too! ADMIT it, after all...isn't that at least ONE of the  reasons you got a Palm...because it *looks* cool? Like the Palm, this looks  cool, works great, and after a week you'll wonder how you ever did without  it. (One addition not mentioned in the other reviews: don't expect to use  this sitting on your lap, as the keyboard folds up in the middle. You have  to set it down on a table.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great and looks *cool* too!", "unixReviewTime": 959212800, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2000"}
