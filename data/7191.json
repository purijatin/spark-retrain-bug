It comes with a polyester zippered case, reminding me of scuba diving skins.Slide one catch, and it unfolds.  Slide two sliders on either side in, and you  have a just about full size keyboard.  Key feel is pretty good, does not  feel cheap.  It's construction looks well made, not cheesy.  You fold out a  little shelf on top for the Palm computer device. The Palm is offset to the  left a little on the Palm III keyboard model.  Can be a bit confusing at  first...not much though, just watch where you initially place your fingers  for touch typing. When done, slide the little shelf back in, slide out two  slides on either side of the keys, and fold up the keyboard.  To a size a  little wider than the Palm computer and about 1&quot; thick or so. Very  handy.Not much more you can say about it.  It's a keyboard!  The manual  comes with good instructions.  I wish it came with a small card with a list  of special keystrokes for it.  But I can make one of those.Nice!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Full size keyboard in a folding, calculator size.", "unixReviewTime": 957484800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2000"}
