It is reliable, it syncs well with Outlook 2000  now that I've picked up PocketMirror, and the amoritized cost is now down  to pennies a day. But after years of use, I still hate that stupid little  stylus. My &quot;graffiti&quot; technique never got better than about 90%  accuracy, I can never remember how to punctuate, and don't get me started  on the little touchpad keyboards. So the Palm III keyboard is a godsend.  First off, its very cool. The key action is very good--soft and accurate.  I'm still fiddling with the delay settings, as the delay is a bit too slow  for my tastes. They keys are also a little too noisy for use in a meeting.  On the plus side, typing notes into the Palm is now a breeze. Better still:  the keyboard is collapsible, so its folds into a small rectangle not much  bigger than a Palm, but is very nearly full sized when unfolded. When  unfolded and locked, it is pretty stable (although I agree with those who  say you can't really use it on your lap). It looks great. What more can you  ask?I recently took my Palm III and keyboard to a conference. Everybody  else was lugging around laptops. I just unfolded my keyboard, snapped on my  Palm and rocked. All my Dilbertesque buddies were very jealous. (Palm  probably owes me hundreds in finders fees.) The only problem: Carrying my  Palm, the keyboard, and my cell phone is a lot of juggling. I need a small  case that carries all three. Anybody know one?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Its cool. Its useful.
