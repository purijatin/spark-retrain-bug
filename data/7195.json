In my experience, the main problem with the other keyboards relates to HackMaster hacks.  With all of my hacks in place -- Graspeedy, Menuhack, Contrast Button Hack  and PopUp Note -- and with a ton of software on my Palm Vx, including the  beta version of the Omnisky/Minstrel wireless software, all functions  perfectly.  I've tried the keyboard with SmartDoc, QuickSheet, MultiMail,  PocketQuicken, HanDBase and all the built-in apps.  It works fine with all  these apps.  The shortcut keys for opening apps and doing specific  functions in an app, also work just fine.  The folding keyboard is an  engineering marvel and, in spite of what others may say, you can use it on  your lap.  Even the case is well thought out.  This is a real winner!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This One Works And More!", "unixReviewTime": 954288000, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2000"}
