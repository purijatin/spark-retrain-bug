However, I wanted to do more with my Palm. I wanted to write on it, but I didn't want to become the fastest Graffiti writer in the process. The Palm V Keyboard became my only solution.When I first started using this keyboard, the co-workers jaws would drop when I unfolded it.  You don't know how cool it is for some guy to take out this thing that's about the size of a Palm III then unfold it to become a full-size keyboard.  People just like to see me unfold it.  It was like a magic trick to them.  Of course, this feeling wears off, but in the beginning, it's great to see their reactions.I love the fact that this keyboard is roughly the same size as a run-of-the-mill laptop computer.  I used to own a Sharp Organizer with one of those tiny keyboards.  It was a pain to use.  This keyboard acts like a full size keyboard. There were other options out there for Palm users such as myself, but a huge selling point for me was the full size aspect.There is a minor, yet manageable drawback with this product.  You can't rest this item on your lap without it fuling and contorting.  You either have to lay it down on a hard surface, or you have to put a hard object on your lap and rest the keyboard on the object.  Granted, I've found a way to bypass the lap issue with a thin, hardcover book when I want to lie on the couch and type, but this issue should be addressed since people might night have a handy book lying around.I love this product. Since I type on it everyday, I need this product.  If you can get by on Graffiti and the Palm Desktop, you don't need this product.  However, if you're away from the computer, and you have a long memo to type out, get this product now!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I use it every day", "unixReviewTime": 980467200, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2001"}
