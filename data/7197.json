It was designed well and worked flawlessly. Only it came out just when PalmPilots were about to disappear from visible use.  Looking back at it, there was some irony in using a full keyboard like this just to create long documents in the device that could then be loaded at a later time to a PC and sent in an email.  At the same time, it was easier than carrying around a laptop.  Looking back at the intended use, one didn't expect to be able always to send a document immediately as has long ago become the norm.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty cool, pretty useless", "unixReviewTime": 1302998400, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2011"}
