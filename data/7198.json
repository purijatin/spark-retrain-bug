There's nothing that could have prepared me for how sleek this thing looks.  No bigger than a Palm III or Palm VII when all folded up, and then, when expanded, the size of a full keyboard!  This is likely to make people stare at you while on the train or subway, just while you are taking it out and unfolding it, never mind when you actually have your Palm Pilot docked on it.I don't need to go on about how well it works or how practical it is, because anyone knows that a full-size keyboard is going to go a long way... no matter how proficient you are in graffiti.  I am a fairly fast graffiti-ist, but that doesn't compare to the efficiency of a keyboard.  Actually, I had no intention of buying a Palm Pilot without this accompaniment.  I had much graffiti practice on my friends' Palm Pilots, so I knew that I could get used to it, but I knew I was going to need the keyboard when I bought my Palm Vx.  So I bought them together, and I'm all the happier for it.I do agree with one reviewer's comment about the fact that the middle part does not 'lock' into place, so you need to put it on something flat, rather than your lap.  Sort of defeats the convenience factor, n'est-ce pas?  But even with that flaw, I will always be happy with this purchase.  Excellent product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Engineering Masterpiece", "unixReviewTime": 977270400, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2000"}
