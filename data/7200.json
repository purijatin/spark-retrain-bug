It is so compact when it is colapsed that it can fit in your pocket.  when the keyboard is open, i can  type as fast on it as on a regular keyboard.  This in conjunction with a  program called co-Launcher lets me launch every app on my Vx with out  needing the stylus...just assign co-launcher to one of the keyboard command  keys.  I use it to take notes in class, keep track of email, write memo's  and todo's.A couple of improvements...It doesn't work if you have  afterburner turned on (i'm sure this is afterburner's fault).  Also, the  arrows default to moving while in a memo that is in edit mode, You have to  the function key + arrow to scroll in an email...this is inconvienient for  me : (Bottom line....i would pay double the price for this product.  It  has made my palm a million times more useful.  Now it is more than just a  game playing machine : )", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "MAKE YOUR PALM MORE THAN JUST A TOY!", "unixReviewTime": 966297600, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2000"}
