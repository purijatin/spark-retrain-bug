It's been one of the best investments I've made for my Palm. It's so much easier than the graffiti or the onscreen keyboard. It feels more natural and comfortable and is great for taking notes. A must have for any Palm V or Vx owner who uses it for any kind of writing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great For Taking Notes", "unixReviewTime": 1038614400, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2002"}
