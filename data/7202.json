When I ride the train, I play a few games to keep from getting bored.  I never bothered composing emails because it took too much time and energy to write out or &quot;tap&quot; all those letters on the on-screen keyboard.  I bought the folding keyboard so I could expand the capabilities of my Vx.  The keyboard is very clever.  It's only a little larger than the Palm and unfolds to a FULL SIZE keyboard.  Now I type up quick email messages and memos for work.  When I travel, I use Word Smith from Blue Nomad software to compose a travel diary.  The text documents I type up become Microsoft Word files on my PC!  While it is not the ideal device for composing a novel, it does permit you the freedom of writing without lugging around a laptop.  If you know someone who uses a Palm Device, the keyboard is an excellent companion gift.  (Just make sure you get the right one - they keyboards are designed for specific models)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best accessory for Palm devices...
