And typing it is usually faster and more accurate.I'm now more productive at work. And looking up phone numbers -- even for persons with whom I dread speaking -- is no longer the chore that it used to be!I think a better name for this product would be, &quot;The Palm Phone Directory Keyboard.&quot; What do you think?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It Makes A Cool Phone Directory!", "unixReviewTime": 1000252800, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2001"}
