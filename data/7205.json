It really makes data entry much more efficient. I can write my e-mails on my Palm now! Make sure you get a Palm brand keyboard, the imitations might not be so good as stated in other reviews. No problems with setup. The keyboard is very light as well. I would definitely recommend it. And I got it for a very very reasonable price from amazon.com merchant.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1073520000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2004"}
