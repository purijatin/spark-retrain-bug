The design of this thing is absolutely geneious!  The keyboard is almost identical to the one on my Dell notebook.Like others have said, there are some  frequently used commands that this keyboard doesn't do right out of the  box, but you can use the software that comes with it to make any key do  whatever you want it to - very handy.THe carrying case that comes with  it fits well and looks good. Whenever I unfold the keyboard, I always get  looks and questions from others.Very useful little gadget!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent engineering and Very useful", "unixReviewTime": 962323200, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2000"}
