Summersgill", "helpful": [20, 20], "reviewtext": "A while ago, I wrote a review of this product entitled &quot;Very cool, but flimsy...&quot; in which I indicated that, even though the expandable  Palm keyboard had changed the way I worked with my Palm V, I'd had some  problems with it.  A few days ago, I was contacted by the president of the  manufacturer (not his administrative assistant), offering to replace my  keyboard.  I got the FedEx a day later with my replacement keyboard.  This  kind of concern for my satisfaction impresses me as much as the thinking  behind the keyboard itself.  As a result of this very positive experience,  I need to amend my original review from a lukewarm 3 to an enthusiastic 5.  The product's still a great one, but the company's focus on the customer  makes it even better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My post-review experience...", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
