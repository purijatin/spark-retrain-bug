Lockmiller \"rlockmiller\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I had a GoType keyboard a while back for a Palm III and found it too big to carry around comfortably, while at the same time having keys too small to effectively use.  This Palm portable keyboard is truly convenient to carry around, very easy to set up to use, and, best of all, it's a full sized keyboard which makes it very comfortable to use just like my computer keyboard.I highly recommend this gadget for both its innovation and its usefulness!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very convenient and amazingly compact", "unixReviewTime": 976752000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2000"}
