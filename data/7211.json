I am very pleased with the sound and  picture quality it offers (I use S-video and Monster co-axial cables). This  is my first DVD player. The setup is quite easy and straight forward. The  keyboard input for titles is nice, but the information you can input is  more than limited. Nice search functions though. The remote control is a  very good one, very easy to use and convenient. One thing I would ask for  is the display turn-off like the Pioneer 704 laser disc player's Film Mode.  I can turn off my receiver's display too. So the bright blue light and big  amber display is somewhat distractive during the movie. I don't have  digital input on my TV, so I could not compare that with the S-video. But  as far as compare to the laser disc, it's very close unless you pay good  attention to it or play at lower speed (laser disc is better). Overall,  it's a well built player, but there is definitely room to improve.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound and picture quality", "unixReviewTime": 965174400, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2000"}
