The lack of usability actually comes with loading and maintaining the disc inventory.It is NOT STATE OF THE ART, that for the  TITLE as well as for ONE ARTIST there are just 12 characters, despite the  GUI interface  and the mouse and keyboard. I do like this product, but it  obviously never went through some USABILITY testing. I can only hope that  there will be some software upgrade available. I seriously recommend the  product, but be aware that the nice part - the disc database is MORE THAN  LIMITED.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good machine - in comparison - still lacking usability!", "unixReviewTime": 958435200, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2000"}
