When that happens, the symptom is that the carousel won't turn at all (the only thing that works is the front door will still open/shut, but nothing else mechanical works).This white knob that needs to be put back into the black slot/track is just to the left of the area where the disk plays (looking straight on from the front of the unit).  You can reach it easily by just removing the top cover (4 screws on the sides, and 3 in the back).  I'll try to upload a picture, with a red arrow drawn to the area.(update: bummer! ... I've got a picture, but apparently users can't upload their own pictures for this particular item.)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "How to fix it, when it stops working", "unixReviewTime": 1341273600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2012"}
