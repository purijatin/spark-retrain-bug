Vanpelt \"Movie madness\"", "helpful": [9, 11], "reviewtext": "I all ready have 3 other Sony products operating from one remote.There were no other command controls to add a 4th Sony DVD changer,so I picked this Pioneer disc changer.It stacks up great to the Sony changers I have.Very easy to use right out of box.The one con I can see is once DVD's are loaded I can't seem to find an eject button to remove a DVD if I wanted to.The price was a little higher than the Sony 400 disc DVD player I own but I see no reson not to buy this one.Especially if you only need one and not 3 or more.You can also daisy chain two of these together and have all controls for both in one remote.Again I use a Sony intregated remote commander RM-AV3100 which allows for up to 18 products to be programmed into it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "DVD disc changer", "unixReviewTime": 1152403200, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2006"}
