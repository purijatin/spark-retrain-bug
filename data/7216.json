I still remember the first Universal movie we fired up. It had the new (well, new then) logo rotating into view around the Earth. With a component video hookup it looked so good it almost passed for 3-D. It still looks as good today.Frankly, I'm surprised to see this model still for sale considering how quickly most electronics come and go. I suppose that says something about it, too. To be balanced, there is a small gripe. Only 12 characters can be entered for each disk title. I suppose it's limited by what can fit on the front display. It helps that there's also an artist field. It doesn't display on the front but does appear on screen when display is pressed on the remote. Oh, and the remote isn't backlit.The very minor gripes certainly don't amount to more than a small fraction of a star rating. Therefore, I still rate it as a solid 5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pioneer DV-F727 301-disk player well worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1213833600, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2008"}
