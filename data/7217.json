I had all the CDs about fifty that I only used on road trips. Now I have the music I what all the time. The only misrepresentation on the product is that there is no \"light\" in the access door as illustrated. Other that that it works fine. One Note: I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING ANY MULTI-DISC PLAYER ON RANDOM. The reason is the volume changes from old CDs to the remastered.
