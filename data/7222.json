However, this 300 disc player has made me wait more than 30 seconds between tracks.Also, when I connected the CD player - cassette recorder synchro cables between the two units, it disabled the CD player's remote. I haven't tried to record anything yet, but am discouraged by the extremely small remote for the receiver that requires a magnifying glass to read and is a \"phat phinger\" accident waiting to happen.This makes it very difficult to interact with the Pioneer system without a lot of effort.Ease of Use=2 Features=3 (historical)Quality=4", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "RANDOM PLAY: like the capacity but not the wait", "unixReviewTime": 1159920000, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2006"}
