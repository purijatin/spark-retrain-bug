I was very surprised to find that the PD-F1009 CD changer is still being made after all these years.I bought mine some time in early 1999, to replace an early-90s 100 disk model that died. Yes, it has CD-TEXT capability, and you can--if you're patient enough--load in some info on each CD. Rather than do that, we got some of those big binders to hold the liner notes, and numbered each slot with a Sharpie. This makes the CDs easy to find by number. We have a third binder to hold our overflow CDs, and sometimes rotate them in.Anyway, our CD player has gotten a fairly active workout for more than a decade, and still works just like it did on day one. It seems to have its own personality--always picking out my CDs versus The Other Half's when on random--but has never failed us. Pioneer used to issue new fleets of components every year or so, changing the numbers as they went. Who knew they stopped at this one for the CD changer, and never changed it? Obviously, it works.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mine is 12 years old and still works!", "unixReviewTime": 1298764800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2011"}
