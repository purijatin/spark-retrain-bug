I read the reviews and determined that the problem still exists, so I opted for this Pioneer unit. I have had it running 3 months now and have not has any problems. Audio quality is average thru the RCA cable. Ya gotta get the optical cable for premium sound. You might consider an upgrade to play MP3's or DVD's - I saw no need for those features, considering the added cost. I highly recommend this CD unit! A great buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid unit", "unixReviewTime": 1193097600, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2007"}
