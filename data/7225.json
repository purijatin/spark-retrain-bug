They are all at least 10 years old with never a problem.  The F1007's are actually better in that they can be daisy-chained although unlike the 400 disc changers made by Sony (I have two of those also) it won't play a cd's automatically between the two changers.Unlike a previous reviewer, I think the remote is one of the best features.  It has one button random play plus a \"favorites\" function to set up a special play list which is also just a one button operation.I'm migrating to a digital system only because I have more cd's than the systems can handle, but if that isn't an issue, I highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best of the CD changers", "unixReviewTime": 1281312000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2010"}
