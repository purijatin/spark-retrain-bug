Previously I used film and scanned the photos; this makes an incredible difference to my productivity. And the results I get are much better than before.No matter what I ask of this camera, it does the business, makes me feel like more of a pro than I am.I love the ability to twist the lens and look down on the screen; all cameras should be like this.You'll need to spend quite a bit of time getting used to the many different screens if you want to use anything other than auto. It's all a bit complicated, but you eventually get used to it.I would have preferred a wider wide-angle too, and the on-camera flash is nothing special. And it EATS batteries! Also, my example occasionally refuses to switch; the only way is to open the battery cover. It's not exactly small either...BUT the pictures it takes can hardly be faulted - even blown up to A3 size!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very impressive", "unixReviewTime": 972259200, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2000"}
