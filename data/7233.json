This is a general follow-up on my two earlier reviews, Sept 26, 00 CJ, and Oct 22,00 CJinPa. I'm updating this review because of the enjoyment I get from this camera and all the support I recieved from other &quot;posters&quot; as I researched prior to my purchase. If you consider this product, you'll LOVE your purchase.I snapped a lot of pics with this thing and print out the good shots on my printer for framing. Believe me, I've taken lots of shots, but only a few &quot;really good&quot; ones. BUT, my technique gets better all the time. This &quot;learning curve&quot; would of sent me to the poor house if I used my 35mm Nikon and had to develop all those rolls of film.  Digital is &quot;free&quot; after you make your initial investment in the gear.  I bought a pile of add-on lenses and flash assys. for the camera to get the most out of it.There is a great E-Book by Peter iNova &quot;Mastering Nikon Digital Cameras&quot; ($50)that is a detailed 990 camera; instruction manual - photo techniques - editing &amp; printing tutorial that is the PERFECT companion to your 990 purchase. The E-Book is interactive and will help you MASTER the 990 to its potential. Get this if you get the camera, i believe this is a MANDATORY purchase. If this was out when I bought the camera, I'd of saved 3 months off my learning curve.Well, not many more good things to say that haven't been said before. Excellent quality pictures, great quality camera, and ample support from Nikon (if ever needed). This camera is a great buy that will leave you happy with your investment 4,500 pictures later. Enjoy your new purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nikon 990:  5 months later", "unixReviewTime": 980726400, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2001"}
