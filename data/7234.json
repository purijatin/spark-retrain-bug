Howe", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "If you decide to purchase this camera, understand that you are not selecting a point-and-shoot digital camera.  This compact camera is a full featured package designed with the 35 mm photographer in mind.It comes with a complete set of controls -- everything from  fully automated exposure to manual control, autofocus and accessory lens.  As a result it reacts to your needs and requirements in much the same way as a Nikon 35mm SLR would.  Therein lies the rub; to fully exploit the 990's features and capabilities, you have to work with it.  The more you use it, the more you will like it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Camera", "unixReviewTime": 992476800, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2001"}
