Nearly every flash photo has red-eye.  I have read that this is because the flash is too close to the lense.  However, fixing red-eye on your computer is easy, so it's a tolerable defect.2)  Although the camera body rotates, it's not quite as user-friendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the Canon G-2.3)  Resolution.  I always shoot on \"fine\", but still end up with some photos that I'm not crazy about the resolution.  Pictures with lots of detail turn out great, but where there is less detail, you end up seeing the little dots.  Although people say a 3.0 megapixel camera approaches film quality, I disagree. I see the pixelation even on 4X6 prints.Conclusion:  I'll continue to use (and love) my Nikon 990 until I save enough to replace with a 4-5 megapixel camera like the Canon G-3 or Nikon 5000.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nikon 990", "unixReviewTime": 1039564800, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2002"}
