Hatzigiannis DMD, MD", "helpful": [73, 73], "reviewtext": "I owned this camera for about 4 months, and in the time took over 1000 photos with it (yeah, I know, too much free time!). I used the photos for on-screen presentations, as well as 8x10&quot; printouts. The camera takes just incredible photographs, with accurate colors, and very sharp definition. Here are some other points I saw:*autofocus was fairly quick during the day, but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light* flash: powerful, but nothing you do can get rid of red-eye in virtually any shot (red-eye reduction mode is useless)*camera can store photos in separate folders, which is useful for multiple occasions*no support for Microdrive is a fatal flaw*metering system is extremely accurate; found virtually no need to use the spot meter*macro ability is second to none*for dentistry, takes wonderful intraoral photos, utilizing the chair light and the built-in flash; not terribly good, though, if you want to focus on ONE tooth, since the flash will wash things out. The resolution is good enough, though, that you can focus on a quadrant, take the shot, and crop it later.Overall, found it to be the perfect camera, minus the red-eye problems and lack of microdrive support. So I sold it and bought a Canon Powershot G1 (review forthcoming)...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great camera with some flaws", "unixReviewTime": 975715200, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2000"}
