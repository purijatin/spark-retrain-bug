The 995 has a 4:1 zoom, and a few other improvements, but this one is a bit smaller - I like it as well. You have more control with these Nikons than any other. And the swivel design makes it possible to take shots in situations you couldn't with any other camera, even IMHO the newer LCD designs like the CP5000 or Canons. This is a great camera, it takes great pictures, and the accessory lenses make it an excellent system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love the camera", "unixReviewTime": 1004745600, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2001"}
