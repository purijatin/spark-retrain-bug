You may be able to get a good deal on a used model.  I use it as camera that is shared by many departments where I work, so it gets heavy use.The quality of photos taken in bright light on the &quot;fine&quot; setting is stunning and prints well as 8 x 10s (you can even get away with larger sizes, if you don't mind a little pixelation).  The camera's auotmatic mode is adequate for most shots, but you can adjust the shutter speed and other customizable features.  The pivoting lens body is also handy to get into tight spaces.  The LCD screen is bright, but can be hard to read outdoors.Battery life is 40+ photos with rechargables.  I don't recommend using Alkalines with this camera, but they work in a pinch.The biggest drawback with this camera is the flash.  The proximity of the lens to the flash means you'll be correcting lots of &quot;red eye&quot; on your PC or Mac.  The flash is also very weak in low to medium light situations, and you can't add an external flash to the camera.This camera sometimes fails to start when turning it on, or shuts off after a few seconds on, but turning it off and on again seems to help.  I attribute these glitches to age and abuse due to heavy use rather than poor manufacturing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A bit bulky, but takes beautiful high quality photos", "unixReviewTime": 1051228800, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2003"}
