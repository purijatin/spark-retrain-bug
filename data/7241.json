The shutter delay is hardly noticeable, and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly. Batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time. However, the Quicktime movie capability is a little awkward -- no sound -- and the color of the images seems to always be a problem.However, if you're looking to buy a digital point-and-shoot today, this is the camera to buy. The independent, rotational-lens design is brilliant. You can point the thing at yourself and view your self-portrait as you take it, which by itself makes this camera  a standout in my book. Add to that the top-quality optics and dazzling array of features, and this model is the one to beat.Given all that, for the time being I'll stick to my (film-based) Olympus Stylus Epic for most of my shooting on-the-go. The Nikon is too big, too slow, too energy-hungry, and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the Olympus does.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost mature technology", "unixReviewTime": 989884800, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2001"}
