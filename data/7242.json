I have made over 6,000 photographs with it.  I carry plenty of battery and memory (two sets of NiMH AA batteries and a Digipower battery pack), two 32 mb, one 64 mb, and one 80 mb memory card.  ON a shooting trip I take about 400 pictures or more per day.  Quality is excellent; I have made full page, full bleed color brochures with it.  Most of the time I use XGA mode, high quality compression, 400 kilobyte per picture.  For pro work I use full size high quality, but still JPEG, 1 megabyte per picture.  It is exceptionally well suited to smoothly textured subjects (sky, water, glass) where the lack of grain is paramount.  It is somewhat less suited to intricate subjects (forest).  The swivel LCD screen makes formerly difficult shots easy (low or high viewing angles).  Macro focus is excellent.  Color balance and exposure control very good; you will want to edit most of your shots in a good bitmap editor (Corel Photopaint for instance) to rotate upright and equalize color.  You can also apply a &quot;film-like&quot; s-curve adjustment to make it look just like film if you wish.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nikon Coolpix 990 -- Six Months and Six Thousand Pictures", "unixReviewTime": 979084800, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2001"}
