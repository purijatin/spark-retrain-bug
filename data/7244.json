I agree with others that the 990's menu system takes some time to master if you really want to maximize the potential of this camera.  You can use the auto mode to take great pictures right out of the box though.  This camera, just like the 950 is a hog for batteries.  I like the fact that I can carry regular AA batteries as an emergency backup, but better yet, get two sets of rechargeables.  I use the camera to take &quot;crude&quot; pictures of radiographs and intraoperative pictures. The ability to select for light source makes this much easier.  It does a very good job for the radiographs and takes excellent surgical pictures (great color accuracy).  The flash unit is fairly weak so consider trying to get the elusive external flash adapter (hard to find in stock).  That's my only complaint with these Nikon digital cameras.  The accessories are sometimes very hard to get.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Even better than my old 950", "unixReviewTime": 977529600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2000"}
