It is a first generation player, and it shows.  Badly placed controls are the second-worst thing.I'm curious if anyone can answer the following  question.  Does the Nomad II fix my biggest peeve with the Rio, namely: if  I stop the Rio in the middle of a song, when I start it again, it goes back  to the beginning of the track rather than starting off where I stopped  (like my portable CD players would).  Pause would work, but it turns itself  off in about a minute anyway, losing my place as above.  Not a big deal on  3-minute hits, but a PITA for symphonies and progressive rock, with tracks  as lon as 30 minutes.Anyway, if anyone is willing to try this in their  nomad II, I'd really like an answer.-ben-", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Question For Reviewers", "unixReviewTime": 959299200, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2000"}
