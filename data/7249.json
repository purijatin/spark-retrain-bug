Get this, I was walking up the stairs at a store listening to tunes and it came unclipped and fell through the stairs down two flights and landed on a wood floor. Parts went everywhere, the screen shattered. I found all the buttons which went back on easily. I put a new battery in and IT WORKED and STILL WORKS!!! The one bad thing is the clip is weak......obviously.This is a great little unit. Nice screen size - the biggest I believe. Intuitive interface and sleek design. Let's face it, it is the most physically attractive unit out there. Sound quality is great. The headphones are surprisingly good quality and comfortable. Easy to use software too. I need to and will buy a replacement. Creative does it again!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Survives Just About Anything!", "unixReviewTime": 1023148800, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2002"}
