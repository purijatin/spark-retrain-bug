It still has a lot going for it; it's sleek, compact, and attractive, it's got Bluetooth and WiFi, and a 624 Mhz processor (the fastest processor available then). But I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model, especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004. It uses Windows Mobile 2003 (WM v4), which isn't supported by MS anymore. The current version of Windows Mobile is 6.1.Additionally, Dell has discontinued the Axim X30 since 2007. You will have trouble getting support from Dell if you run into any problems.But complaints about it being outdated aside, the Dell Axim X30 has a few significant problems with it:1) A problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out. There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't \"see\" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life. I can squeeze about 2.5 hours from the battery it comes with - and that's with Bluetooth ans WiFi turned off and the screem dimmed down.5) On my X30, the power/data connector completely broke loose.I would advise you to pass this up.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Few Serious Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1233792000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2009"}
