I really wanted the radio stations and recorder.  But I found the reception for the radio to be poor, and I live in a major city.  I also found the design of the battery holder and cap to be a royal  pain.  I have to fight to get it open, and the battery and memory insert  very poorly designed.  You need to remove the memory to remove the  battery.I love the wireless control.Overall, enormous advancement  from the MP3 players of a year ago, but engineering-wise, they needed to  spend a little more time in beta testing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Some sloppy engineering", "unixReviewTime": 963100800, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2000"}
