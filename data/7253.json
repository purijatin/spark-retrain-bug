After this, I will never by another diamond product.  MP3's sound fantastic and the volume is great, I love to listen loud.  The FM tuner sounds great despite what I've read from other reviewers.  As an owner of a sound studio, my standards are high, and the Nomad sounds excellent.  The big test was to see if the management software and data transfer was a breeze or not.  Took about 15 secs to load the software plug in the device and start transferring my mp3s.  the software is the better than rio port (diamond's).  I haven't owned this product long enough to speak for its durability, but the basic design is tight and puts the new RIO 600 to shame, and is a step above my old RIO 500.  The remote control is a very handy tool to keep the main unit deep in your pocket or backpack.  As long as it keeps up what it's doing, it will be on my recommend list for all. enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Total Package.", "unixReviewTime": 977702400, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2000"}
