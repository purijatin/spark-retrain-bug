PC software is intuitive to use.  Download to device is fast with USB.  Sound is great.  UI on device is very easy to use.I've been using it  running.  It's light.  Holds 17 songs.  Software lets me make mixes from my  mp3's and download to the device for a run.  Really great all around.The only drawbacks I can see are that the radio isn't as good as, say, a  sony walkman sports radio from a reception standpoint, and, as with all  these mp3 players, the memory isn't as big as I'd like today--would be  great to load up, say, 50 songs at a time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product", "unixReviewTime": 958262400, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2000"}
