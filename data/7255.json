ALL files were sampled at  128kps/44.1 KhZ.  ALL files also play back with compression artifacts  (flanging): pops, whistles, cracks, and 'skips'.  The firmware CODEC is  defective, as these files play fine on my PC with software CODECs.  I tried  upgrading the firmware to the latest version, but keep getting an error.  The only way to get tech support from Creative is to call a toll number.Products should work 'out of the box' without user intervention.  This  one doesn't.  I plan on returning it tomorrow.  I read another review that  recommended buying a minidisc player for about $100 USD less.  Sounds like  a great idea.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Please don't buy this defective wonder", "unixReviewTime": 965865600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2000"}
