BUT THAT ONLY COMPARING TO OTHER MP3 PLAYERS THAT ARE NOT SO NEW. I PURCHASED THIS MP3 PLAYER LOOKING TO USE IT IN THE GYM. IT HAS GREAT FEATURES AND IS VERY USER FRIENDLY. VERY LIGHT IN WEIGHT AND SMALL TO FIT WITH ITS HANDY BELT CLIP. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THIS UNIT ONLY CAN HOLD 64MB MEMORY (ABOUT LESS THEN AN HOURE OF MUSIC). THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR MY TO USE WITH A 2 HOUR WORK OUT . THE OTHER NEGATIVES ARE THE MEMORY SLOT IS IN THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT SNUG TIGHT. THEIR IS NO ROOM FOR YOU OT PULL THE CARD OUT AND THE BATTERY IS IN THE WAY. VERY POOR DESIGN ON THIS MATTER. I ASK MY SELF WHY CREATIVE WOULD DESIGN SUCH A GREAT DEVICE BUT ONLY STORES UP TO 64MB OR MUSIC AND HAVE SUCH A POOR DESING FOR MEMORY STORAGE. ALSO IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS ITEM BUT ABOUT 4 BATTERIES YOU WILL NEED THEM IT EATS THE POWER UP 2 HOURS A BATTERY IF THAT. SUGGEST THE NOMAD 2 MG  WITH 128-190 MB . THIS ITEM IS NOT PRICE JUSTIFIED DUE TO THE LACK OF MEMORY", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "THIS IS A GREAT MP3 PLAYER BUT....", "unixReviewTime": 994377600, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2001"}
