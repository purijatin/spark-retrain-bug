I wouldn't buy another player from Creative Labs because it is too fragile.  I only used the unit at the gym a few times a week.  The first thing that broke was the wired remote, which I found to be very useful.  The menu on the unit is easy enough to figure out, but rather slow to navigate.  It takes several steps just to check the time.  I liked the behind the head ear phones, they don't pinch my ears, but I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.  The ear phone sound quality is just average.  I'd have to say the quality of the product as a whole is just average.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good until it broke", "unixReviewTime": 1044576000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2003"}
