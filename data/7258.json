After using them for 2 months or so I think it's time to tell about my experiences. First you should know, that the MG version sounds much better and also seems to have a much better radio tuner, which is suitable for mobile use. The ordinary Nomad 2 has a more useful display, but the sound really sucks. Overtuning and cracks during radio playback are a steady companion. On contrary the MG Nomad 2 sounds remarkably better (actually as good as it looks) and the finish of the hardware is top quality comparable with SONY standarts on mobile devices. But beware: Handling is a real mess. It will make you crazy accidentially pressing various buttoms on the mg. If you are about to choose, take the much more expensive Nomad 2 MG. At least it sounds good and is the best visual design availlable on the market. The ordinary Nomad 2 is a 100% disappointment and a shame for Creative's hardware line up", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "better buy mg", "unixReviewTime": 976838400, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2000"}
