Internal memory capacity is 128MB, expandable up to 256MB as the unit accommodates smart media memory up to 128MB.The thin, palm sized player is powered by a single AA battery.  A fully charged 2000mAh NiMH battery provides power for around 6 hours.  The display is readable, with a backlighting feature.  The controls are reasonably convenient, and fairly sensitive.  Located near the top of the unit are the volume controller and a switch to lock the controls.  The unit produces an adequate volume level, with the headphone jack being located on the top of the unit.  A set of low quality headphones is included, but you will experience better results when using better quality phones.You can select random play, or repeat play a single track or all tracks.  The DISP function button provides several preset equalization levels, with one customizable \"user\" setting available.  The microphone is a tiny dot on the front of the unit, and the voice recorder does just an average job of recording conversations. The PlayCenter2 software is a little clunky for those accustomed to working with drag and drop, as the transfer speed is not especially swift.Solid reliable performance and sturdy construction make this product an attractive buy if you are considering a product with this relatively low memory capacity.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1110672000, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2005"}
