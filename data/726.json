Mine is still functional in 2012.I have had numerous PDA's; from the Palm M Series to HP's Jornada and IPAQ to a Toshiba and an ASUS MyPal A716. This Dell Axim A30 unit is by far - hands down - the most impressive unit that I have used.The unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the ASUS A716 (also still functional after all these years). It does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures - soft resets are few and far between.Even refurbished, these are very reliable - an all-in-one gadget for all your needs (I prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone). Shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban living!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for PDAs of the Period", "unixReviewTime": 1338508800, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2012"}
