It is engineered for use with almost any type of camera and its compact size makes it the perfect tripod to take along anywhere. It has a weight of only a little more than 2 pounds and has a folded length of 22 inches.  With an extended height of 60 inches, it is perfect for almost any application, including portraits and landscapes.This tripod has some professional features, like the bubble level, 3 way panhead, accessory hook.  The flip lever leg locks allows for easy and quick setup/takedown.  A tripod doesn't have to be that complicated, just hold the camera steady and secure.  This tripod does the job.  I can't find much difference between this tripod and one costing ... more.For an entry level tripod, or just the weekend photographer, this is a great tripod to have and transport!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Lightweight Tripod", "unixReviewTime": 1025481600, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2002"}
