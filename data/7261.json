I have used about 3 times. The head has come apart from the center post. It appears the head screwed into the center post and the grooves have stripped. It is going to cost me shipping plus an additional $3.50 to send it back for repair or replacement.Additionally, the tripod is steady if you use the hook at the bottom to hang your camera or gadget bag but make sure you tighten down the screw that holds the center post or it will wobble on you.I realize it's an inexpensive (cheap) tripod but just because it doesn't cost much doesn't mean it has to be made poorly. Buy it at your own risk.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not a good buy.", "unixReviewTime": 1006905600, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2001"}
