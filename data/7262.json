This Vivitar is light, easy to handle and carry.  Great for the hobbyist.  It has a nice tight fluid motion, feels stable, and the quick release allows for switching from camcorder to digital or 35mm camera on demand.  Vivitar managed to get a lot out of a light weight tripod on this one.  It should work for any amature and some serious filming.  No, it is not the professional model, but it certainly will work great for anything short of professional requirements.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value", "unixReviewTime": 1004227200, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2001"}
