It's a decently priced, portable and sturdy piece of equipment. Maybe not the top of the line a professional photographer would buy but definately good for hobbyists or general users who just need a tripod and want one that will a) stand up without wobbling b) not cost and arm and a leg.It is fully adjustable in pretty much every way you could expect as well.
