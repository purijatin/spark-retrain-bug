However, I contacted the seller, and he immediately refunded my payment, no fuss at all. While this purchase didn't work out how I wanted, I would happily purchase from him again.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bad flash, but GREAT customer service", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2014"}
