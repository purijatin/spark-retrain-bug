The Vivitar 285HV, although including more power settings, a zoom bracket, and built-in flash diffuser, is actually step backwards from the 283. The construction of the 283 is just rock-solid. You get metal parts, not chrome painted plastic like in the 285HV. The clicking of the flash as you rotate it from horizontal to vertical is precise. Even the build of the plastic is better. Some company needs to pick up the original 283 design, add in power settings down to 1/64th, made the head swivel-able, and put in a built-in optical trigger. Sell it for $90 and that company will be golden.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Viva la Vivitar", "unixReviewTime": 1250640000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2009"}
