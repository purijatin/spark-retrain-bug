Limit, as far as performance--can't take an SD card bigger than 2G (no SDHC cards), and only runs Windows Mobile 2003 SE. Still works great for what it does. Can connect via 802.11b to just about any hotspot available, and plenty of apps still floating around the net for Windows Mobile 2003, but if you have the money, as I didn't, I would suggest the Axim x50, the last of the Axim series Dell made.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely love this thing...", "unixReviewTime": 1269820800, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2010"}
