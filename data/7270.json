Edelman", "helpful": [92, 93], "reviewtext": "The venerable Vivitar 283 doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles of  some other flashes. There's no coupling to the camera's computer and no  through-the-camera-lens exposure control.But what you do get is a  rugged, powerful unit with automatic and manual modes and a very complete  family of accessories. You can get diffusers, auto-triggers, manual power  adjusters, remote cables for the auto sensor, AC power supplies... just  about anything imaginable. And there are aftermarket accessories, too; I've  equipped my 283s with metal replacement feet and a detachable mini-softbox.I own *four* 283s, and I use them for everything from small-product  tabletop shooting to portraits to outdoor nature photography. There's  nothing more reliable and versitile on the market.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Professional Standard", "unixReviewTime": 967680000, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2000"}
