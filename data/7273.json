Hosek", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewtext": "I struggled with this thing for about 6 months on my Mac and I would almost always have to unplug and replug the USB connector into the hub to be able to actually sync. I figured perhaps it was a deficiency in MacOS (of course my Windows box is prone to forgetting that it has old style OR USB ports which made it even less usable for syncing) and I would have to live with it (and just not demonstrate syncing my palm when I was showing off my mac).Last weekend I had a mishap and my palm was crushed rendering it unusable (but thankfully it was willing to sync and for that Palm should be hailed). I bought a new PDA the same day, going with the Sony Clie (I'll write a review in a few weeks after using it a while longer). Suddenly syncing worked exactly the way it was supposed to work. So my advice is sell off your old Vx, III, VII, etc. skip the USB kit and buy a USB-native palm. yes it will cost more in the short run, but you'll find that your life will be much improved overall.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "better than nothing, but you're better off with a newer palm", "unixReviewTime": 1025568000, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2002"}
