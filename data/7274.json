I have a laptop that has not serial port and a Palm IIIxe. Well, I went through the installation and everything went well but at the last step, it would not synchronize. I contacted Palm support and in a few hours (yep, not one day, or two days, but just a few hours) they sent me an email with the solution. And IT WORKED!.Here are my suggestions to others who want to give this USB kit a try: (My laptop runs Windows 98SE, btw)-Don't use the CD for the installation of the drivers... Look to the right and choose the PalmConnect USB kit software for your O.S.-On the download page, they include installation instructions that vary a little bit from those included in the CD. Make sure you follow the installation instructions on this Web page.-Before you synchronize, make sure that the HotSync software has Local USB and Local Serial checked. (This was the solution to my problem). To make sure, these options are checked, right click on the HotSync icon on the System Tray, and see if Local USB and Local Serial have check marks next to them. Now synchronize.This should do it! :) It worked for me! Everything runs a-okay. :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It does work!", "unixReviewTime": 1010534400, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2002"}
