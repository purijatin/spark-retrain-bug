Gordon \"barabajagal\"", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewtext": "For all of those who have had trouble getting this to HotSync under WinXP, a Palm support person finally got it fixed for me with a very simple solution.  Make sure of the following:1) Make sure you are using Palm Desktop 4.0.1, NOT anything later.  If you need to uninstall 4.1, and download the older Desktop 4.0.1, it is hard to find but can be found here: [...]2) From there, basically follow Palm's instructions, except:3) Make sure both Local Serial and Local USB are checked in the HotSync menu,4) Check under Hotsync Setup that the Hotsync (virtual) Com Port used matches the PalmConnect Com port under Hardware...Device Manager..Ports (COM & LPT), and5) SET THE SPEED TO THE SLOWEST SPEED (9600).  This is the key to all our problems!Then, after successfully performing a HotSync at the slow speed, you can bump the speed back up to \"As fast as possible\".With this I'll bump my rating up to 3 stars because it works but has poor manual and web site explanations for installing the drivers.Below is my original one-star review from yesterday, for reference:The box says it's compatible with Win98, Me and 2000. Palm supposedly has upgraded the drivers for XP- I downloaded these from the Palm web site.  When installing this (on a new laptop with WinXP with no serial port) according to the instructions, everything seems to install fairly smoothly except that afterwards Hotsync can't find the \"serial port\" it's looking for.  Which of course is the whole point of the device.  I tried the suggestion of another user who said you need to use version 4.0.1 of Palm Desktop.  I tried that and it gets a little farther along- recognizing \"USB serial adaptor\" as the installation device- but still doesn't work.  Very frustrating.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "XP ISSUE FIXED!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1100476800, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2004"}
