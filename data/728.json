I also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small.  This one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be.  Fast service from the seller with several pre-and post-shipping alerts from the seller, too.  A real pleasure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This unit rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1254182400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2009"}
