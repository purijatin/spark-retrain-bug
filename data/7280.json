After multiple inquiries to Palm's website (which responds promptly), I have now been told that I must first unplug the USB connector before powering down the computer.  Otherwise, each time the computer is turned on, the PalmConnect software must be reinstalled.  Hardly the level of convenience I expect from Palm!If you leave your computer on all the time (and there are not frequent power outages in your area), or you don't mind unplugging and replugging the USB connector every time you power down, this product will work under Windows XP.  Not acceptable, in my opinion.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Clumsy under Windows XP -- at best", "unixReviewTime": 1021593600, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2002"}
