I don't really miss it but it  would be nice to free up my hands and stick it on my belt.  (but then  again, I will look less like a geek.)Makes Palm III more bulky.  Difficult to keep in pocket.Not much room inside to store anything  besides a business card and a couple of scraps of paper.Velcor mount for  Palm III not very secure.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice case.
