The case is made out of the same material that wet suits are made out of.  The case is totally shock proof, and splash proof.  If you do not yet own a case for  your Palm organizer, then this is definately the one to get.  Can't beat  the price either.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great case for your Palm organizer!", "unixReviewTime": 956361600, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2000"}
