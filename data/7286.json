The PalmGlove was up to the task.  My Palm gets dropped, tossed, and spilled upon and is doing great.  The case has also stood up to a fair amount of abuse.I like the inside pouch, it carries my bank card, business cards, and a VISA perfectly.  If you use your Palm a lot and don't want to worry about it beaten to death, pick up a PalmGlove, it is worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best get protection", "unixReviewTime": 985046400, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2001"}
