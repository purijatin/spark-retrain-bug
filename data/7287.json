It seemed to be cheap leather around a cardboard case,  very flimsy...no zipper, bad velcro.The PalmGlove is a great case, the  zipper is VERY sturdy and the case is made exacltly what wet suites are  made of, so I don't know how water resistant it is, but it will soak up  most of the water before anything reaches your palm.  Also it is a very  good cushion for your palm in case you drop it!  Great addition to my palm  and I am very happy with it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product for your palm", "unixReviewTime": 965952000, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2000"}
