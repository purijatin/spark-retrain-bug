But what I learned in trying to get help from cBear was that (1) they can barely write English, (2) their first strategy is to send you all of the pre-written scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and, (3) if you persist, they will express doubt that there is a problem but will (grudgingly) agree to let you return the product.  I didn't need to do that because the drive works with software other that ACER's eRecovery but note that returns subtract 15% of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping.  I determined that the drive I received is an unlabeled OEM Toshiba drive and that's a respectable brand.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good product, strange tech support", "unixReviewTime": 1266624000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2010"}
