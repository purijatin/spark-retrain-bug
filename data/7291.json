That is because after using Intellimouse Explorer, Logitech Mouseman Wheel Optical, and this one, I would say the Logitech one is the easiest to operate and best built. However, its also twice as expensive...The Pros:- Compared to Intellimouse Explorer, its smaller and so fits people with smaller hands- The extra two buttons, which are placed on the left hand side on the Explorer are now one of each side so you don't have to flex your thumb as much- The surface is not as shiny as Explorer so makes it easier to grip.- The optical technology is faster so it feels more accurate than Explorer.- Did I mention its cheaper than Logitech Mouseman Optical? :)- Unlike Intellimouse Explorer, this works for both right and left handers.The Cons are:- This depends on the user but I found that Logitech fits my palm better than this one- The side buttons are loud! It makes a loud plastic sound.- The construction seems flimsy especially compared to Logitech's. Maybe the reason for the loud side buttons!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best mouse for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1006992000, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2001"}
