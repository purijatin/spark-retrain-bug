I plugged it right into my USB port and Windows 98 found the  software and I was off.  All I had to do was install the software to  customize the side buttons, the installation took no more than 3 minutes.  I use one button to double-click and one button to view the desktop.  But  that isn't the main reason I bought the mouse.  I have a laptop and I like  to use it in my bed.  The mouse-stick thing and the fingerpad aren't as  great as a regular mouse and I don't have anything for the ball of the  regular mouse to roll on so I'm stuck.  This mouse I can you on the covers  of my bed, on the sheets, anywhere.  It's great it always works.  I  recommend this mouse 100%.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best mouse one can buy.", "unixReviewTime": 968112000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2000"}
