Whenever i use a regular mouse, it takes a little while to get used to - mainly because the Intellimouse is sooooo light, and very easy to move. It works on all surfaces, which is great, I use it on my bed, on my leg, on my stomach (when there is no place to put the mouse while using the a laptop, stomachs and legs come in handy).  I will never again buy a regular mouse, optical technology is definatly the easiest.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I never thought using a mouse could be fun", "unixReviewTime": 971136000, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2000"}
