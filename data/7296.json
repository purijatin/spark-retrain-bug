This mouse beats anything that Logitech currently offers, and I've been a fan of their mice for years.  This mouse has control I've only dreamed of, and has excellent adjustment  software.  There's only one reason I'm giving this mouse 4 stars, though,  and that was the installation.  I felt queasy switching over from a PS/2  mouse to a USB mouse, and I was right.  It took me about five reboots and  two software reinstallations before I got the mouse to work right, and I  could take the old mouse offline.  If you are a beginner computer user, you  might want to have someone who knows what to do install the mouse for you.  Other than that, this product did what it claimed to do, and more.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A wonderful product, but prepare for installation headaches!", "unixReviewTime": 960249600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2000"}
