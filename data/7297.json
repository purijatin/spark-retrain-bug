They also suffer less from dirt or dust, which is a major problem with the &quot;regular&quot; mouse.  This particular mouse fits well in my hand and works great, even though I have dropped it regularly (by accident) because my work space is less than ideal.However, I have found a drawback.  I travel extensively and have been taking this mouse with me.  Lately, I have noticed that the USB connector is not working so well.  I do not appear to have the same problem with other USB connected devices, so I suspect that the connector on the mouse is &quot;not what it could be&quot; in terms of heavy usage.  If you are basically going to plug in your mouse and leave it, this will NOT be a problem.  If, however, you are like me and will regularly plug/unplug the mouse, throw it in a briefcase and let it rattle around, this may prove to be a difficulty over time.  I have traveled with it for approximately six months.  Interestingly, I have swapped it for the one on my laptop basestation and both are working fine...so the connector is not completely worthless...just a little sensitive.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well but does have a drawback", "unixReviewTime": 1025049600, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2002"}
