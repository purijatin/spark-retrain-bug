I wanted something different and looked at several mouse type devices, like the Trackball, Marbleball, etc.  I felt I didn't want to learn how to use those devices and opted to get another standard mouse.  But that's so standard!  I wanted something the same, but different, ya know?  Enter:  Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical.  It used a brand new technology which claimed to use a revolutionary optical sensor, not a mouse ball.  Smooth and precise-no skipping, no jamming and had two extra buttons on either side.  Let me say that this mouse is as wonderful as the red &quot;glow&quot; on the underside of the mouse.  I use it for regular applications, gaming, and Internet.  The two extra buttons are regularly used for the &quot;back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; functions in your web browser but can be programmed for anything else.  I play Age of Empires II: The Conquerors and you can set &quot;Hot Keys&quot; for some of the game buttons.  The extra buttons really help. Also, I didn't even have to install drivers or anything, the thing just worked as soon as I plugged it in.  Anyhoo, I recommend this mouse if you have never tried an optical mouse.  It is durable, fun to use, and the two extra buttons are a great idea.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great gift for anyone with a computer!", "unixReviewTime": 975283200, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2000"}
