I purchased the Intellimouse Explorer as a Christmas gift to myself and loved it. The size and button placement never bothered me, but the color and overall  appearance did.Microsoft got it right with Intellimouse Optical! Its  color more closely matches the rest of my system, the placement of the  extra buttons is admittedly more logical, and the price is even cheaper!  Best of all, it's identical to its more expensive sibling in terms of  features and performance.The included Intellipoint software allows you  to customize the mouse action (scrolling speed, cursor speed, etc.) and  cursor appearance to your liking, and each of its five buttons can be  reprogrammed to perform some other function if you'd like. As with the  Intellimouse Explorer, my favorite feature allows you to lock the scroll  wheel by depressing it momentarily. Then, to scroll through a document,  simply move the mouse upwards or downwards. The farther upwards or  downwards that you move the mouse, the faster the scrolling speed will  be.It's rare for me to spend this much money on a product, especially  when a previous product is functioning properly, but I gladly parted with  the money for Intellimouse Optical. It performs beautifully, looks and  feels great, and is worth every cent of the purchase price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Product", "unixReviewTime": 957225600, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2000"}
