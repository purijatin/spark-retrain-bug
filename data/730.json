Rabson", "helpful": [32, 33], "reviewtext": "I needed an external CDRW/DVD drive for my Toshiba NB205.The Acer Aspire One USB External DVD/CDRW CD Burner suits my need perfectly. For my purposes, a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly; that's it. I don't need it to be especially fast or to look pretty. Fortunately, for me this external drive is quiet, unobtrusive, and reliable.It has one eccentricity that I've found. It comes with two USB cables - one for data, one for power - and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two USB cables from your laptop to this device. I do think it's weird. I've never seen this before.I've had no technical problems of any kind with this device. I am thoroughly satisfied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quiet, unobtrusive, fully functional, slim; I love it", "unixReviewTime": 1250899200, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2009"}
