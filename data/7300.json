I loved this mouse except for its ocassional tendency to jump to one side of the screen, but when it wasn't doing that it was the best tracking mouse I have ever used.  But, when my second one broke I decided to go back to my old standard Microsoft ball mouse.  I dont' know if I just had bad luck, but I would recomended it if mine hadn't broken.  I guess my final comment is, happily purchase at your own risk.  Good luck.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I really liked it until it broke...
