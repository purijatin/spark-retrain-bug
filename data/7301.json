I got this in 2001 and have used it almost all of this time. Works as well today as when new. I have gone through at least a dozen mice roller balls and track pads on various computers but this one is always with my main computer ( been through more than a few computers also). Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "11 years and still going", "unixReviewTime": 1366848000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2013"}
