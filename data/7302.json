I like this mouse better than any other mouse I've ever used!  No more  moving the mouse around to get the ball unstuck!!!  My husband used it for  a CAD drawing and said that he finished it in half the time it would have  taken with the standard ball mouse.  We originally hooked it up to PS/2 and  then switched it to the USB.  The mouse performs noticeably better with the  USB.  However, we gave the mouse two thumbs up even when it was hooked up  to the PS/2.  We'll never go back!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "wowie", "unixReviewTime": 967420800, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2000"}
