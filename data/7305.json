I have had this mouse since they first became available and it still works flawless. Two seconds to install, easy easy easy! It is great for browsing  the internet. Besides the standard two buttons it has a center wheel which  i like to call it which you can turn to simply make a webpage scroll up and  down. It also has two buttons where your thumb sits which are basically  your BACK and FORWARD buttons on your internet browser. This mouse is  simply the best one there is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What took them so long.", "unixReviewTime": 958262400, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2000"}
