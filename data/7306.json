My substitute had been the track balls and other alternative input devices but none seemed to match the mouse's easy of use. The 'optical' also eliminates the mouse pad (yes, no more gifts please) and the shuffling you have to often do in order to get traction. Very good product and none of the wrist cramping.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brought me back to a mouse", "unixReviewTime": 972172800, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2000"}
