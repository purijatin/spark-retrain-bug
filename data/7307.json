After getting used to a wheelie mouse at work and not having one at home, I'd been meaning to pick one up for some time now.  This mouse moves extremely smoothly over my mousepad, and has a cheerful looking red light shining out the back (palm) end.  The only complaint I have with the mouse is that the two side buttons are too easily pressed while just moving the mouse around, especially when you have to pick up the mouse and reposition it.  You have to make sure to grab the mouse at the base, below the buttons while you're moving it around or picking it up.  Still, the side buttons are quite useful for web surfing.  The thumb button takes you back a page, the finger button takes you forward.  Of course, the button action can be customized to suit your needs with the Intellimouse software.  Definitely a worthy addition for anyone tired of cleaning out those gunky rollers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent mouse", "unixReviewTime": 978739200, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2001"}
