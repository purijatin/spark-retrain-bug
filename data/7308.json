First, unlike its bigger sibling the IntelliMouse Explorer, this one doesn't have too many buttons that simply confuse you.  The buttons on this model are located at the right place for  your fingers to click and they are all very resonsive.Now the pad-less  operation, it's simply fantastic.  I had my doubts about its useability  until I tried it at CompUSA.  I've been using this for weeks and it simply  works on any surface I've tried.  Just incredible.  The movement is smooth  and accurate and the feeling that you never have to worry about dust (okay,  not really true since you have to keep the lens clear of dust, but better  than dust-collecting mouse ball) is liberating.The shape is ergonomic,  continuing Microsoft's tradition of building ergonomic input devices.  I  now hope there will be a wireless edition sometime soon.  (MS: are you  listening?)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THE Mouse to Have", "unixReviewTime": 956880000, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2000"}
