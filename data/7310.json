The center wheel-button is EXCELLENT for scrolling. The wheel turns with almost no resistance; and to me that is the most redeeming feature of this mouse. Any other mouse I've used with a scroll-wheel wasn't nearly as easy to &quot;spin&quot; as this one. It truly changes the internet browsing experience. . . so easy to sit back and scroll pages. And you can click the wheel, then move the mouse slightly up or down and the page will scroll automatically. The auto-scroll speed is determined by how far you move the mouse. Great for speed-reading long pages. Most people I know have never tried this auto-scroll feature. TRY IT -it works in practially any program. If you can't figure it out, ask me!And throw away that mouse pad if you want. You shouldn't need it unless your computer desk is glass. I can even use this mouse against my pants-leg if I want to lean back away from the desk and give my wrists a rest. Tossing away my mouse pad took away some of the clutter from my desk.Another plus for this mouse is the USB compatibility. Since I have a USB hub on my desktop, I use that port instead of connecting the mouse to the mouse-port on the back of the computer. That means even more freedom for the mouse and no more tangled cable.The red glow of the mouse is so cool - especially in low light.Lastly, be sure to install the software for this mouse. It may appear to work after plugging in the mouse even without installing the software; but you may notice some features do not work. But with the accompanying software you can configure everything. The default configuration was perfect for me.Happy scrolling !", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Love THIS mouse !", "unixReviewTime": 981158400, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2001"}
