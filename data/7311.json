I was so tired of cleaning the ball on my convential mouse. I love the way this one just glides on the desk with total control. I am also sold on the side buttons for forward and back, what a great invention! This mouse makes the computer and internet a whole new experience. And I look forward to not needing to drag out the alcohol and q-tips every other week. I highly recommend this product!! Give it a try, you will not be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is the greatest!!", "unixReviewTime": 975974400, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2000"}
