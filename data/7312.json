This may be the  responsivness of the USB port but I don't think so.5) When you move it  very fast across the surface it loses its place and goes haywire causing  the cursor to fly all over the screen ending up somewhere other than where  you wanted it. (my regular intellimouse is much less sensitive to this  problem.)I gave it three stars because:1) I should never have to  clean it2) It comes with USB &amp; PS/2 adaptor - this means I can use  it in the USB socket of my notebook and plug a full size keyboard in at the  same time.  (Very Nice !)Overall only an OK product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good overall but limited", "unixReviewTime": 965088000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2000"}
