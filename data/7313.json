Having gone through 3 mouses (mice?) in just over a year, I was tired of buying new ones and having them last a few months before the familiar &quot;bang and pray&quot; (also known as &quot;percussive maintenance&quot;) was required to get the things working.The Intellimouse uses optical technology so that dirt/lint/dust and bad track balls won't hamper your pointing and clicking.  At first I thought the price was a bit high, but after using mine for a few months without a hitch, I highly recommend one to anyone who never wants to replace another mouse again!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Thank God for Technology!", "unixReviewTime": 978480000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2001"}
