This is one of the first generation optical mice, so the sensor doesn't take as many pictures/second as the newer mice.  What does this mean?  If you're playing fast games (FPS especially) and make a quick movement, the mouse will move in a random direction.  Very bad scenario.I've also gotten quite into Tiger Woods 2003, and this mouse is very bad for the game because:- you need to have perfectly smooth motion to swing the club, since if you move it too fast the mouse moves another direction causing bad swingsand it's good because:- it trains your hand to have perfectly smooth motion to swing the club, since if you move it too fast the mouse moves another direction causing bad swingsso when I get a next generation mouse my game should be unstoppable :)Logitech's entry optical model (the most inexpensive, quality, but basic optical mice I've worked with) is much better and doesn't have this same problem, and you can move it as fast as you want without negative results.In conclusion, the main points of this mouse are:Pros:- the side buttons and clickable wheel are convenient and programmable- optical technology means no more cleaning the mouse ball(then again, every optical mouse has this feature)- good size, not too heavy like the Explorer (the next model up)Cons:- Games will cause much frustration- Maybe not all will see this, but mine is rather cheaply build (made in China) and the right mouse button randomly to makes odd feedback when clickedI suggest skipping this one and going a newer generation mouse with similar features.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good optical mouse with one big problem", "unixReviewTime": 1050364800, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2003"}
