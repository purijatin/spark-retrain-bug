The MS Mouse tended to become unreliable for a variety of reasons (dirt, oils, general wear and tear), and prior to the 1st Intellimouse there were better alternatives in terms of other features. In fact, if you ever used one of the Logitech optical devices, then you had the pleasure of using a reliable and functional device. And you wondered why Microsoft could not do the same.Well wonder no more, they did it. This is a solid product, it will be reliable as the optical movement technology has already been proven, and you need no reason to purchase it other than your own bad experiences with mice.Buy this today.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This mouse is for you", "unixReviewTime": 974073600, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2000"}
