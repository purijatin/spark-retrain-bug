That is why you are on here looking at this product.  Well...let me just tell you I was the same way...I had a perfectly good mouse...there was nothing wrong with it...it was a little dirty but it never missed a beat and served well and was on it's second computer.  But, like some of you the optical mouse has for one reason or another caught your eye.  Well...catching your eye may not be enough...it will eventually catch your hand and you'll never go back.  This mouse is light, and it is large.  But it's designed so that even small hands like my sister and big hands like mine can use it with ease.  The two extra buttons are great...with the back and forward feature plus scrolling you never have to leave the actual page you are at.  In the 3 weeks I've had my &quot;smart&quot; mouse I've become so attached to it I am at a loss when I use any other mouse.  I believe that you will be the same way.  My girlfriend loves it...and she is getting one for christmas!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unsure...well time to be sure", "unixReviewTime": 975024000, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2000"}
