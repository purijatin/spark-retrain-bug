You can use one on your leg, on your tummy, on a picnic table if you are camping out, on a desk if you are a student, etc.  If you are using a notebook as your main computer these days, invest in an optical mouse - you won't regret it.My one major objection the the MS Optimouse is the always on LED - it needlessly uses up precious battery power on a notebook/laptop.  I also find the side buttons useful but overly sensitive - they should be recessed.  And I much preferred the ivory white color of the previous MS mice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "best for use with notebook", "unixReviewTime": 971740800, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2000"}
