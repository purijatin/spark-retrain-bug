Robert Lee \"Dardanarius\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "This mouse has great optical resolution (1500 dpi) which results in extremely precise pointer movement.  The shape is fairly comfortable and the button placement is well thought of.  I especially appreciate the  buttons on either side of the mouse which act as back and forward buttons  for the internet browser.  The plain beige color is also nice if one has a  plain beige PC setup like I do.There are, however, a couple of problems  that I encountered.  Because of the lack of support for the right side of  one's palm, the pinky finger could get sore after sustained mouse use.  The  previous generation MS mouse does not have this problem it seems.  Also the  optics would not work correctly on certain type of surfaces; any surface  that is shinny/reflective, or too complicated like a photographic mouse  pad, the pointer will jump and skip pretty regularly.If one does not  mind the ergonomics of the mouse and use it on recommended surfaces, this  little device is about as good as they come.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice mouse though not perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 957052800, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2000"}
