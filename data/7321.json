My desk's surface doesn't have enough color variation for the mouse's camera to track properly, so I still use a mousepad; but I still find the mouse pointer's movement to be  quite a bit more consistent than with most mechanical mice.I don't find  the two side buttons on the mouse to be particularly practical, though; I  don't need to go back and forward in my browser often enough to justify two  mouse buttons just for that purpose, and the 'back' button is positioned in  such a way that it's fairly easy to click it accidentally with your thumb  while moving the mouse.  I also find the extra LED to be a bit silly.  (This is the LED in the curved window at the bottom edge of the mouse that  you can see in the picture; it has no function--it's just there to glow and  'impress' passersby into saying &quot;Wow, that must be that newfangled  optical model...&quot;)You might want to consider the basic Intellimouse  with IntelliEye instead; it has the same optical mouse mechanism in a more  standard form factor, without the side buttons and the extra day-glo LED.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good mouse overall, but the side buttons are impractical", "unixReviewTime": 956880000, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2000"}
