I bought (and reviewed) the bigger Explorer, but found too many faults with it. This mouse is the right size, has the right feel, and responds flawlessly to input on almost any surface. The extra (programmable) buttons work without getting in the way. The red glow is still cool without being as bright as the Explorer's near-lighthouse luminescence. One thing for sure: optical mice are here to stay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this one.....", "unixReviewTime": 970099200, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2000"}
