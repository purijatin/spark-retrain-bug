I've put in USB scanners and such with less work.  Still - I'm happy with it.  Works great.  I went from a trackball marble to  this IntelliMouse - I'm not yet sure which I like better, but I think it  will work better for games and photoshop. :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Once it's working - It works great", "unixReviewTime": 957484800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2000"}
