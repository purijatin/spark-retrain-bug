Most would look at the price tag and immediately choose an old fashioned cheap mouse with a ball inside.  One thing to keep in mind is that the mouse is one of the most important devices you use, except for perhaps the keyboard.  Anybody who has a computer knows that after a few months or even weeks, traditional mice begin to stick when you try to scroll.  This is because lint and dust build up on the inside and prevent the ball from rolling smoothly.  With the optical mouse, there is not ball.  As a matter of fact, there are no moving parts to get clogged up.  In addition, this mouse includes 2 buttons on the sides, which are customizable.  I use them for going forward and back on the internet.  A scroll wheel is also included, allowing you to easily and conveniently go up and down in documents and on the internet just by spinning it.  Any computer user will appreciate the precision of the mouse, and the fact that it does not require any cleaning or maintenance.  Gamers especially will appreciate the precision, although it may take a little getting used to because even when the mouse is less than an inch above a surface, it can still function.  Once you get the hang of using it, you will never want to use a traditional mouse again.  Throw away your ball mouse.  It is time to see the light.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Throw your mouse ball away", "unixReviewTime": 991872000, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2001"}
