We always had a pair when I was a kid when we would go on hiking trips, but that's as far as my knowledge of binoculars goes.That said, these seem like a great pair of binoculars. I decided on these based on the small size and great reviews. I can throw these in my backpack and they're so light I probably won't even know that they're there. They feel well made. The attached cord seems a bit thin, but that isn't anything I really care about.I was surprised at how inexpensive these are, yet the quality appears to be excellent. They also include a carrying pouch so that you won't scratch the lenses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Value", "unixReviewTime": 1283299200, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2010"}
