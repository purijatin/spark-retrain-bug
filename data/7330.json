It seems like whenever we go on a vacation he always sees something at a distance that he wishes he had binoculars to see better, and never has any, so these are our new pair to keep in the car. They aren't the most amazing binoculars in the world, but if you're sitting in the cheap seats at a sporting event, or see something in a field while you're out driving, or anything like that, these are great. They're nice and small, so they easily fit in a glove box or coat pocket, and they're pretty clear and easy to use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good car binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}
