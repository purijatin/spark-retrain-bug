These binoculars made the show enjoyable for me. I could make the detail out of every costume, set piece, and character face from at least 75 feet away from the stage.I recommend these for that extant. I'm not a spy or bird watcher so I can't speak of this product for that usage.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great of Theater", "unixReviewTime": 1380758400, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2013"}
