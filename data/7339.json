He wanted a real, working set of binoculars, but I didn't want to spend much money in case this is a passing fancy. These binoculars fit the bill, so I purchased them.They arrived in a frustrating clamshell. Beyond that, though, I couldn't ask for a better set for my money. It took him only minutes to figure out how they work, and he had the carrying case strapped to his belt almost immediately.We took them to our local Wild Animal Safari drive-through, and he kept the neck strap around his neck so that he could view the more distant birds and animals.He is thrilled with them, and I am thrilled. For the money, they are a decent pair to work with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First set of binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2013"}
