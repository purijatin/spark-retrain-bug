This DVD/CD burner is sold with the Windows ME driver, a generation behind the XP.  I tried downloading an updated driver from Microsoft, no go.  I tried contacting cBear, hoping they would support their product, NOTHING!  $25 paperweight is now what I have.  Amazon should drop cBear as a re-seller.  (It's not Microsoft's job to support cBear's hardware, it's cBear's job to support their product.  Not even ansering my email is not acceptable.)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "cBear Acer ASpireOne USB External DVD/CD-RW", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2013"}
