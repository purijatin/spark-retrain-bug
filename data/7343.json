Compared to my Bushnell 12x25 pair, it is about a quarter size larger, and the entering light amount is less.  Therefore, although the object appears slightly more magnified, it is also dimmer.  Like all Bushnells, this pair is easy to use.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a decent product", "unixReviewTime": 1303257600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2011"}
