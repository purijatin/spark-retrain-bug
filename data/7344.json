I own a pair of old Bushnell Instavision 8x21 bincoulars that are excellent for me, but due to my wife's nearsightedness do not work for her.  I was hoping that these would be as good as my other Bushnell binoculars and work for both me and my wife, but I was really disappointed.  The field of view does not seem to be as wide a claimed, and the mis-alignment between the two sides was such that the left and right images would not merge when I viewed though them.  The effect was rather like trying to look through a pair of tubes.  There were also a lot of bad internal reflections.  All in all, I found these to be totally unusable.It really is a dispappointment about the poor optics, because that size, weight, and general form factors was othewise excellent.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worthless", "unixReviewTime": 1400544000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2014"}
