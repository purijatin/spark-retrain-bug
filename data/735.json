I based my decision on size, price, and the fact that you do not need to use two USB cables to power this up. This plays CD's and DVD's as well as any internal drive in a laptop. I can watch movies, play music and install software. No big deal to pack it with the Netbook and take it with you. Excellent product, would highly recommed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent external CD/DVD drive", "unixReviewTime": 1312761600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2011"}
