I used them yesterday for the first time, and I must say these do the job just great. The size is very small, so you can put them in a small purse, and the touch and design of them are very delicate. I was sharing them throughout the whole performance, and I did not have any problem at all with the focus; they were in focus all the time. I did not know much about binoculars, so I did some research online before buying. I found out Bushnell was a very reliable brand, and the price of these on Amazon is just great ($19.99 while I am writing this review). I wear glasses, so I have to take them off to use them properly; but that is just fine with me. My seats at the opera this year are among the worst, because I wanted to see the whole season for a cheaper price, so I needed to make sure I got binoculars. I am completely satisfied with these, and I do not need any fancier or more expensive ones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Opera Goer", "unixReviewTime": 1191196800, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2007"}
