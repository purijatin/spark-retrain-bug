Lee \"electronic enthusiast\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "Great magnification.Lightweight & folds somewhat compactly. Used it to see Radio City Spectacular sitting in the rafters. Turned my seat into an orchestra seat! I got to see the Rockettes as 50 foot giants!Just a couple of concerns: sometimes it enlarged too much, I had to lower them to find what I wanted to see. Also, be wary of dim lit places, or you may not see much through the lens. Certainly pleased with it. The amount of money I saved from purchasing the least expensive seat over the pricey orchestra seat more than covers the price I paid for these binoculars!!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Bushnell Binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1322438400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2011"}
