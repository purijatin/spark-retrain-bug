At the same time they have enough power and a nice wide field of view to be very versatile and perfect for all kinds of situations.I have pairs of high magnification wide angle binoculars which for many situations are what is required but these compacts are so much lighter I find myself using them instead just because they're more convenient and comfortable.I wear variable lens glasses and these binoculars work just fine with the cups folded and also unfolded when I perch my glasses up. The relief seems to be about right for me at least.Finally the price is truly excellent and it's a mystery to me how such excellent optics are produced at such a low cost..They are a great deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}
