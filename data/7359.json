The main reason is that they do not have the option of sharpening one eyepiece separately and then sharpening the focus overall with the center focus \"wheel\".  There is only type of focus (the center mechanism) so if you have one eye that is sharper than another you cannot fine tune these binocs. for the weaker eye.  Otherwise, they seemed like a decent pair of binoculars for the price - just not for me.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sent them back", "unixReviewTime": 1335916800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012"}
