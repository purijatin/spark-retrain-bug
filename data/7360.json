They magnify pretty well, come with a little nice belt loop case, And a good value for the money. The only issue is that the eye pieces are really small so when i press my eyes all the way to the optics they don't work that great (I have to back my eyes up a little) and of course the cord is bad and don't really see a way to replace it..Bottom Line: Cheap binoculars that will get the job done, small, compact then these are what you want.  If your a professional that relies on crystal clear comfortable magnification probably not.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014"}
