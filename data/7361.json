Christensen", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Within days of receiving this product, the rubber around the eye piece fell off. Not a big deal, but annoying nonetheless. The quality of the optics of the binoculars leaves much to be desired, but of course, that is a function of the price. In humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up. The lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses, making them almost useless. I just left them somewhere when I was traveling. On the plus side, they are small, light and convenient to carry around. Would not buy again, even though they are inexpensive, it just isn't worth the $20-30 that I spent on it. If casual birding in your backyard is all you will be doing with these, this is the product for you. Otherwise, don't bother.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Cheap price, cheap quality", "unixReviewTime": 1250294400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2009"}
