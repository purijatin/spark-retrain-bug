Don't expect to do any serious dolphin watching with these. You pay for what you get. They are better suited for near field viewing such as viewing birds in your backyard.The compact size is great for packing these on hiking trip, they can easily fit in your pocket or day pack. Although I have not tried they may also be good for the ball park or theater because of the practical size.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "good for back yard viewing", "unixReviewTime": 1362614400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2013"}
