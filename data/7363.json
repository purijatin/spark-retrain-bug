These appear to be decent.  Good magnification with minimum distortion.While there are models with more magnification you have to keep in mind that with higher magnification comes more problems with distortion when you can't hold the binoculars steady.  This model is a very goo compromise.Comes with a reasonable storage case and appears to be well constructed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Needed some small binoculars for shows", "unixReviewTime": 1375228800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2013"}
