The field of view is not wide, but the clarity is quite good, and focus was relatively easy.  They are sturdy and well made.  For the price it would be very difficult to find any competitive product.  Bushnell is a fine company and I have been satisfied with other products which they have made.  These binoculars are small enough to bring conveniently to the opera house, or anywhere.  At the 8X level you get a good view of a person performing.  You do not see the whole stage, or a group of people.  But the purpose is to focus in on one person, since your eyes can see the larger stage.  You cannot go wrong at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great as opera glasses, tremendous value for the dollar spent", "unixReviewTime": 1388880000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2014"}
