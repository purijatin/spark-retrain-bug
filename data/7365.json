The only word I can think to describe the image is foggy, especially in bright sunlight.  I ended up using a pair of 8x21 Tasco cheapies that have a much clearer image than these.  The 2x extra magnification doesn't do any good since the image is so bad. I don't know if mine are defective or if it is just the quality of the binocs.  They are also much bigger than I expected, but still very compact.  I will definitely be returning these.We'll call the 1 star rating for the compactness and look & feel of these.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Image is \"foggy\"?", "unixReviewTime": 1339632000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2012"}
