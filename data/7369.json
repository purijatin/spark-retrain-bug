They worked great and for the price could not be beat.  Overall the 8X was better for seeing the stage as the 12X was more prone to movement and needed to be really steady. For people who bird watch I would recommend either as they are both very light and small", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1309737600, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2011"}
