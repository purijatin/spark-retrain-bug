Johnson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Wasn't sure where I'd be sitting at a concert I spent a lot of money on tickets for, so I purchased these beforehand, figuring that even if I was sitting further than I'd like this would ensure I got a better view. These did the trick just fine. The strap isn't the most comfortable but it was easy to use and very sturdy. I like the case it came in as well. I don't use them often but I'm glad to have a pair laying around just in case, and the price was right.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bought for a concert", "unixReviewTime": 1371340800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2013"}
