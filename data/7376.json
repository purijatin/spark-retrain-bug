The most irritating feature is the neck strap is attached near the center of the binoculars causing them to stand off your chest when hanging around your neck. This causes them to not sit flat but bounce and twist when walking/hiking. The right occular adjustment is not tight enough and you must constanty readjust it as it move so easily. These are for quick spotting distant objects or for kids. Not quality glass for longer glassing sessions. Thank you,", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "These are just okay", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
