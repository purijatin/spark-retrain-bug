The build is somewhat rusty and cheep.  The neck strip is way too thin.  The focusing ring provides for a reasonable distance range.  Overall - very good value for the money.  I've seen better optics and better build however at a much higher price.  For the casual user or the casual use I strongly recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1258675200, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2009"}
