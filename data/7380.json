Winton \"cwinton\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "These binoculars look good and feel good, but the pair I received performed abysmally.  They have been returned for a refund.  There are too many alternatives out there to mess with a manufacturer who apparently doesn't test what comes off the assembly line.  My pair had exactly the same problem reported in the other negative review; namely, a doubled image.  I had no problem getting both sides simultaneously in focus, with good clarity on both sides, but no amount of additional fiddling with the binoculars would eliminate the doubled image.  Such an inexcusable alignment error represents either lack of testing of the finished product, poor design, or poor internal construction.  Over the years I've owned a number of binoculars from other manufacturers and none had this kind of problem.  Since the binoculars I received can only be used as a monocular, one star is as good a rating as they merit.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Also seeing double", "unixReviewTime": 1357257600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2013"}
