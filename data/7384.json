My son was thrilled with these binoculars. And when I tried them out myself I was impressed.We left the day after Xmas to go on a guided nature tour of Costa Rica.After a few days on the tour one of the guides had a look and noticed that the optics were not aligned. I checked myself and there was a significant double image effect. My son was 12 at the time, not a wild kid, but a normal red blooded boy. It's possible that there was some mis-handling, but he had not dropped them and I don't think any of his handling could be classified as abuse. Besides he really did not have time to do anything abusive to them.I think if you plan to use these for the occasional concert or trip to a national park, etc -- this should work well for you and is a great value. If your looking for something that you can toss in a bag and carry half way around the world, or hiking across the continental divide - you probably should consider something else.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good value - but be warned, not rugged", "unixReviewTime": 1243900800, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2009"}
