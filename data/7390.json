I bought two pair as a Christmas gift for my 3 and 5 year old grandsons thinking the size that would fit their hands was the key feature. Wrong! The power is great and unexpected on my part. They are substantial in construction as I would expect a Bushnell product to be. I would agree with those reviewers who said they would be perfect for use in live theater or the opera. I will make sure that when the grandsons visit us at our summer place on a Maine lake that they bring them along. We do a lot of kayaking and spotting wildlife and waterfowl is a great thrill for them. These glasses will make it even more meaningful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014"}
