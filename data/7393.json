For that purpose, they're ideal.  They're compact, sturdy, have a decent (soft) protective case, and I have no problem seeing my targets.  The exterior has a durable, rubberized coating, so I expect these glasses to be a longtime traveling companion.  Highly recommended for the money!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy range glasses", "unixReviewTime": 1322784000, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2011"}
