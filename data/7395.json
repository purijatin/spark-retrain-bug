Shipping was fast and i just returned from a trip where I used them in the San Francisco Bay Bridge area. The first thing that I noticed right away was how difficult it was to Adjust the Focus Setting, on the Right + & - eyepiece ... I had to monkey around for a while,and when I finally \"set\" it at a good position, the result was not Satisfactory, for me. It just seemed to be \"off\" a bit.I used them in both an urban and beach environments and they were just adequate ... probably more useful in a Archery or gun range, to be used only as a spotter scope, if that.Bushnell makes some really great binoculars, but this is the \"Cousin\" they never talk about!As a photographer, I'm always searching for possible working sites from which I can position myself and my camera ... but this was too much trouble, and I didn't want to use my camera's zoom, as that drains the batteries.* Conclusion - This would be a great Gift for a Cub Scout or new Boy Scout, as the Price is really great and they are small & lightweight, so that works. I was generous with 3 stars, because they are no better than a 2.5 star rating. But, for $25 bucks, I can't really expect a whole lot.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Brand - Bad Focus!", "unixReviewTime": 1301788800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2011"}
