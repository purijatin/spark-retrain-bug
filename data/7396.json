Oh, and very affordable as well. Focus is smooth, images bright. It comes with a cheap, but functional vinyl case with belt loop and Velcro closure.  I can recommend these optics. Of course, the reader should consider that this assessment is based on the purchase price compared to features and quality received.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Bushnell Powerview 10X32 Compact Folding Binocular", "unixReviewTime": 1373587200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2013"}
