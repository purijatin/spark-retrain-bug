Norris \"Cowgirl n Indian\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I wanted to have a set of binoculars for shooting at the range about 50 yards.This set works really good and is clear.  One lens seems to have a distortion on the edges but it did not impact when looking directly at something.the 16 is a tight zoom on objects at up to about 100yards.  I could see each hit on a 50 yd paper target with a .22 caliber rifle.  I went to 150 yard and I could see larger caliber holes on the target, but I would use a spotting scope if going out that far.My main purpose was for .22 and air rifle competitions for my son and also to have it compact enough to carry when I go out horse back or hiking.  The larger 32mm lens brings in good light and pulls objects together well.I got my set discounted by having a restocked item.  It works for my needs.  High power in a compact set .Oh I had one problem.  The focus dial some how got stuck and the adjustment for both lens got out of sync.  I started to panic, but I just dialed back to the top and pushed it a little firmly until I could see under the binocular that the lens guides were back in line.  It has worked with no problem.  I don't know how it got stuck, other than I had the (really skinny) neck strap string wrapped around the binocular tightly.  The neck strap is a little thin and should have been a little thicker or softer. oh well", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "For the Price I paid they were well worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1333238400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2012"}
