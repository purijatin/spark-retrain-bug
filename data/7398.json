They gather light fairly well, are compact, and seem rugged. the only issue i have with them is that the rubber eyepiece on one side got smashed out of shape due to it moving in Bushnell's packaging. Over all for the price these are great binoculars. Quite frankly i got these for my 4 year old to play and learn with since they were so cheap but i am going to order myself a couple extra pairs.Over all I would recommend this product. They are a decent pair of binoculars at a great price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great value binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2013"}
