On the downside: the optical quality and stability is poor.  But then, for the price, you get what you pay for, especially with binoculars.A note if you do buy them.  One of my rubber end-caps fell off somewhere in the woods.  These rubber end-caps are just slip-ons, so you will need to put a drop of rubber cement on them to be secure.Overall: For the price and easy of storing they are great: 5 stars, but, for the optical performance - 1.5 stars.  There are better binoculars for a little more mula.
