These little folders are a gem -- and a little more forgiving when it comes to eye relief (you don't have to be as ultra-precise about how far you hold them from your eyes as other miniature binoculars require).Image clarity is better than any other miniature binoculars I've owned (close to a dozen pair at this point), including some that retail for 2x-3x this price.  Can't speak to their ruggedness yet but so far I'm very pleased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth twice the price I paid", "unixReviewTime": 1326931200, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2012"}
