The optics however are not that great.  An 8x magnification for this size lens means you don't see clearly, and they could have used more stabilization, especially given how light it is. Picture keeps shaking, especially hard to focus as you have to turn a dial while looking at this vibrating image.  Can't complain given the price, but I wanted something that is easy for a little child to use.  I am not sure if this fits the bill.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lightweight and compact, but poor optics", "unixReviewTime": 1355184000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2012"}
