They fold in half and fit into a small carrying case that comes with them (approx 4\" tall, 3\" wide and 2\" deep).  I was pretty surprised with the small size when I opened the box!  Without any adjustment, the binoculars offered a crisp image of birds, trees and other features around my neighborhood - I can't wait to take them on my next hike or to a football game.  These are a great buy for the money and would be a perfect gift for nature lovers (hikers, bikers, birders), sports fans, or children just discovering the outdoors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprising compact size!", "unixReviewTime": 1357257600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2013"}
