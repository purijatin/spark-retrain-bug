I only wanted a pair because I was going to see the show \"Wicked\", and I had a seat almost in the last row.  I wanted to be able to see the cast's faces.  These binoculars were awesome for that purpose.  The magnification was almost perfect for the distance I was away from the stage. I hardly had to do any panning around.  And the lenses are clear, and I was able to focus them perfectly.  I never took them away from my face the whole show.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good binocs", "unixReviewTime": 1223769600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2008"}
