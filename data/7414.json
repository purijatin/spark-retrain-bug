And you can't beat the value of $40 for a compact, powerful binocular. I was using a much cheaper brand which would not focus that well. But the optics on these Bushnell's are so much better. Highly recommended for bird watching!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful binoculars and great value!", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2014"}
