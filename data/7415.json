Focus is fast and trouble free (has additional adjustment for right eye). Able to easily bring viewing object into both eyes so there is no &#34;double&#34; object effect. Almost too powerful - requires a steady hand. I work in Afghanistan and am able to clearly make out small figures at extreme distances. Very compact - fits comfortably in tactical clothing pockets. Great product. Pleased with this purchase. I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent binoculars - great value/purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1369353600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2013"}
