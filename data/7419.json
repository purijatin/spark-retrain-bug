They are powerful enough to give you good close-up views that usually require much bulkier and heavier binoculars.  They are compact enough to make them very portable and come with a nice soft storage case that can be attached to your belt.  The focus works well for me but you do have to have a pretty steady hand to see clearly.  I sometimes lean on things if necessary. They can fog up in High Humidity conditions (like most others do).  I think you have to pay much more and get larger ones to get past these issues.  Overall, good quality for the price compared to others on the market.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Quality Binoculars for average overall use.", "unixReviewTime": 1345852800, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2012"}
