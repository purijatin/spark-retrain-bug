Installation was easy; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately.I upload Microsoft Professional Office 2007 quickly and easily.  It does play movies, I played my Harry Potter Movie with no problems. The VLC media player was already installed. I highly recommend this player", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1360800000, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2013"}
