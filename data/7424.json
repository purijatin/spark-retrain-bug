I use this sports binocular to see street signs and stoplights. I am prone to falling and I am VERY hard on this poor device.I didn't realize how badly my old binocular was in need of replacement, until the new one arrived. They have really improved this product in the last 4 years.This binocular is rugged, easy to adjust and performs as advertized. You can't beat the price either. Really nice item.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceeded expectations. Improved product.", "unixReviewTime": 1223078400, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2008"}
