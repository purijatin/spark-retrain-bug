They work well and feel substantial while holding them.  I figured at the price, they'd feel cheap and plasticy - but they do feel solid)If I have any complaint, it's the placement of the strap.  It's somewhat inconvenient, but easy enough to work around.  I may just cut it off... I don't think I'll ever use it)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1320019200, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2011"}
