Barnes", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "After being severely disappointed with several other inexpensive compact binoculars I have purchased, I thought I would give it one more try with a reputable brand name. Based on the reviews for the Bushnell 8x21, I ordered one. WOW! Extremely good optical quality for the price, very lightweight yet feel rock solid! I like these so much I bought another for my wife. Ideal for concerts and plays, and we carry them in our cars for wildlife and such.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My search for good compact  binoculars is over!", "unixReviewTime": 1349568000, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2012"}
