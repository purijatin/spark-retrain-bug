It's hard to complain about 25 dollar binoculars,  but I will anyway.The glass is very foggy.  It feels like I'm looking through plastic toy binoculars.  After spending 10 minutes with these, my eyes feel tired and strained.Also, the quality is so poor, that they won't stay focused.  The dial that allows you to focus the right eye is very loose, and requires constant adjustment.Yes, they were cheap...  but what is the point if you can hardly use them?", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Junk!", "unixReviewTime": 1360886400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2013"}
