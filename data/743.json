Thurlow", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This external USB DVD/CD drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle CDs and DVDs.  The drive itself is slim and light, ready to travel with your netbook.  It conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop USB port.  Assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player, you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box.  The drive is not necessarily ruggedized, so some care with handling is advisable. Highly recommended.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Beauty of Simplicity...", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}
