These are nice binoculars, but they are pretty powerful and as such are hard to look through unless you steady them on something while looking.  Just holding them in your hands they are difficult to use for my purpose.  If I rest them on the car, though, I can see whales just fine!  I am not sure I would buy them again though, because for casual use, they are too annoying to use.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice, but powerful binocular", "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012"}
