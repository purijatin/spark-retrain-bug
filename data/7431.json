It could fit into your pant pocket and still give you a useful tool. It has 12x magnification and the image is quite good compared to other binoculars in the same price range. It also has a rugged look and feel with a nice rubber casing.The only problems that I find with the binocular is that 12x is a bit too unsteady to hold with your hands. So I find myself leaning on a nearby support in an attempt to keep the view from shaking. Also due to the small objective lens of the binocular, the view at night is not as bright as it could be (on comparing with a binocular with a 50mm objective lens). These are not really problems of this binocular but are limitations due to its size and magnification.In short these are quite impressive.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good compact binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1105488000, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2005"}
