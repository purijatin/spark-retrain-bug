We have 30 foot ceilings and I am a computer tech. I have wireless access points mounted on the ceilings and I needed something to be able to see the lights on them, power light, access light, etc. I not only can see the lights I can see the identification stickers!!!! Such as 1A-13C-12B on a label which we mark for each one. Now I can read everything clearly without having to get a cherry picker and actually go up there and check on one when its got a problem. Great little product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Little Binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1210291200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2008"}
