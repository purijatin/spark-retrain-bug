KNOWLES", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "a bit dim (obvious given the size), but my pair focused sharp as a pin and is rugged. If you look at the other reviews, there are bad ones 10% of the time or so. I take those for true: QC from China is dicey. These are a 'proper' set though: great resolution, solid build, flat and good color for the price. I would just roll with it if I got a bad set, send back or get another. Even at 2x the price it's a good deal.  Bear in Mind, if you buy an 8x25 bushnell or olympus or nikon and spend $30-90, the view will blow this away.  Still, this is great for the money.  I found them to have much better optics than the Tasco $10 ones I got at WalMart. Those were super-fuzzyacross a lot of the field and dimmer.  Bushnell gives you a deal.  Handy for museums, street signs, light travel, concerts, plays.If you spend a lot of time looking, go for some nice 8x25s or 8x30s.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1387238400, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2013"}
