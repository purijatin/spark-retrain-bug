I was expecting these to be as small as those were.  These are smallish but definitely not pocketable in a shirt.  I was hoping to give them to a friend as an improvement on opera glasses but they are way too big and only marginally better optically.The optical quality is about what you'd expect for $20 or so. The eyepoint is awkward, there's a bright ring of light around the image, and there just isn't any sharpness except in the very middle of the image.  Flare characteristics are terrible. But if I were 10 years old I'd think they were pretty cool.  They look reasonably tough, as long as you keep them dry.If you want something small to really look at things try to get something at the lower end of the price scale of the name brands (Nikon Canon Vortex Olympus Pentax)I'm going to keep these in my car's trunk, just in case I'm desperate.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A nice toy for a child", "unixReviewTime": 1262044800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2009"}
