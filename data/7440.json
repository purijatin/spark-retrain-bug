Trouble is, the magnification (8x) is too high for that use. These binoculars are more suited for outdoor use, such as watching birds or planes land.If you are looking at similar binoculars, you'll notice that other brands, such as Pentax, Tasco, and even Bushnell's camouflaged version of these binoculars, use a different mechanical design where bridge has two separate pieces, and the front piece moves to focus. This design, however, seemed a bit more robust as the bring is one piece, and the moving parts that focus are better shielded from dust and other elements. That is one reason why I chose this particular model.These are a good pair of binoculars for everyday use, not great. If you are serious about frequent use, consider a more expensive brand with better optics. But for occasional use (or use by a child), these will be fine.Four stars for a good product at a good price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Binoculars With Better Mechanical Design", "unixReviewTime": 1384905600, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2013"}
