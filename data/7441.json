I wasn't exactly sure of the power of the originals, but they were close.  The binoculars I received from Amazon were indeed Bushnell Powerview... but they don't look anything like the picture you see.  I guess Bushnell changed the style and kept the name... and Amazon kept the picture.  I won't send them back, because these certainly functional.  But I REALLY wanted what was in the picture!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Picture Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1336953600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2012"}
