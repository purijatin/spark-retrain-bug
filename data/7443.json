Based on the good reviews, I got these, and didn't do more than look through them briefly in the house when they came, just to make sure they weren't broken. The first time they were used for distance outside was last night at a concert--and they were blurry!I thought maybe they put protective plastic over the glass for shipping, but could not see any. These were still virtually untouched in the original box. I found a wrapped lens cleaning cloth included, and tried to clean all four glass lenses, but it made no difference. I asked others to look through them, as well, to make sure it wasn't just my eyes, but they said they were blurry, as well.Everyone tried adjusting them, but they were never right. I pulled up my amazon account on my phone to see about returning them, and sure enough, it was less than a week past the 1 month return window. That means I am stuck with a new pair of defective binoculars. I work all the time, and have no opportunity to use or test binoculars, other than at a show. It would seem that there ought to be an exception for clearly defective products.I would definitely NOT recommend this product!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Blurry first time used, but a week past return time!", "unixReviewTime": 1336521600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2012"}
