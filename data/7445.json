Is their inertial mass the same as their gravitational mass?I've given these binoculars five stars because they seem to have magical properties. It would be great if they weighed 4 ounces for carrying, but had a good solid 11+ ounces for stability when viewing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magical binoculars, contain phlogiston", "unixReviewTime": 1248307200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2009"}
