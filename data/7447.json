Was out for a week hunting and using these for spotting elk from the truck. These are so light with better optics than my compact Simmons that are my pack broncos that I am ordering a second pair to upgrade and replace my old Simmons pack binoculars. Great low light vision. Nice feel in the hand and easiest to adjust of all my binoculars", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fantastic", "unixReviewTime": 1386720000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2013"}
