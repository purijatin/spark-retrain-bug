The focus knobs (in the center and on the one eyepiece) move smoothly and stay in place after you're focused, and the price was right for what I got.  They are small enough that I can shove them in my coat pocket and they are inexpensive enough that I don't care if they get lost or accidentally damaged.  They have a nice weight and feel to them for the price (they don't look or feel cheap, even though they were inexpensive).  I would however buy a higher magnification next time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "They're OK, but I would buy a stronger magnification (can't fault them for that)", "unixReviewTime": 1360022400, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2013"}
