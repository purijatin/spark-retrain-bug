Some people loved it at 5 stars, others hated it saying they couldnt see anything out of them at 1 star.  Undortunately, I joined those who couldn't see anything.  Believe me you when I say I've used A LOT of binoculars so I'm now a newb to this.  I bought them specifically for one purpose, shooting range and identifying where the bullet hits on target at 100 yards - yeah good luck.  By the time I dialed in and finally was able to barely see the target, though still looking very very smudgy, my husband unloaded 2 AR15 mags. Wouldnt even pass this as a toy binocular, my son's $2 chinese made plastic crap shows clearer image.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Absolutely horrible", "unixReviewTime": 1339977600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2012"}
