I wished I was one of you..If it were possible Id rank 0 stars. I ordered these simple Binoculars more than 3 weeks ago with shipping expected to take no more than a few days.. That was Nov 14th It is now Dec 5th. No notice, no contact from anyone as to where these Binocs are. Tracking of this shipment seemed to vanish after Nov 15th, with nothing further info wise to look up..Whats worse I felt that 3 weeks lead time was easy enough for Amazon to fulfill on such a common place item for a sporting event I am attending this weekend.Apparently not in this case.  Frustrating waste of time,, Here's the kicker, I ask for a refund ( Because I never even got what Id paid for!)  and now I am being charged practically half of what these things cost out of my refund for them to be returned??? Where are they even being returned from ??????Ridiculous!!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Awful Amazon should be ashamed", "unixReviewTime": 1386201600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2013"}
