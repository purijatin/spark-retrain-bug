I use them to view a variety of things from a distance, including wildlife and signs. The optics are very clear and the field of view is quite wide. All of the adjustments feel smooth and well-made. While shaking can be a problem when reading something from a distance, it is not the fault of this particular model. They fold up into a very compact shape, which fits in a canvas case. When placed in my jacket pocket, I hardly notice their presence, they are so light.Definitely good for bird identification. Enthusiasts could even carry these around wherever they go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Light, compact, and powerful", "unixReviewTime": 1364774400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2013"}
