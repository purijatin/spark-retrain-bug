Having ok seats and not wanting to carry around a bulky, high powered pair, I purchased these binoculars.  For the price, they really, really served it's purpose. It folds nicely and fits into any pocket or since it's lightweight, you can easily put it in the pouch provided and wear it around your neck.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Compact Binocular", "unixReviewTime": 1172275200, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2007"}
