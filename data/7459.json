The size and weight, and the fact that these fold down small were at least as important as the magnification in my selection.  He uses binoculars to scout game before and during hunting season, and didn't want a big pair of binoculars hanging around his neck or filling a coat pocket.I use them at home to watch the birds at my birdfeeders.  I like that they are manual-focus, and that they're adjustable for different face sizes.  They are a nice mid-range magnification - a good balance between size and power.  When we're done with them, they fold up slim and small, and store neatly in the included pouch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Slim, folding, and great for bird watching or game scouting", "unixReviewTime": 1358899200, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2013"}
