Unfortunatley the updated version is not nearly as nice as the pair I received about 5 years ago. The older version is shown in the 3rd image - I notified Amazon so they may remove it by the time you read this.The old version:- has a nice rubber coating- focuses much better, easier to use focusing wheel- folds down smaller- easier to hold with fingers (round vs. larger flat top section)My old version is also much clearer, but I have a feeling I may just have a bad copy. It's a little blurry even after focusing. The old pair is crystal clear.I'm very disappointed in this new version. I'm looking for the old version online but there's a chance sellers are using the old photo and selling the new version.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Older version is much better", "unixReviewTime": 1347408000, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2012"}
