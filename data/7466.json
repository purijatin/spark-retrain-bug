They are small, (about 5\" in length & 3\" wide when folded) and they are lite weight. But the quality of view was terrible. It might be OK for sitting on the porch looking at a bird in the back yard, (providing you have pretty steady hands), but that's about all. I immediately returned them to Amazon, and they are very good about that. I just wished I had thought about what to expect for $18 binoculars.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Think About it", "unixReviewTime": 1328659200, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2012"}
