They are too heavy for my small children, so I bought these for them.  I am amazed how great these are.  I like these better than my $130 Nikon binoculars.  You can see very far and its so clear.  My 6 and 8 year olds had absolutely no problem with these.  I wasn't expecting much for this price, but am simply amazed on how great these are.  We will definitely take these out to events with us since they are so small as to fit in my wife's (very full) purse.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking for a compact pair of binoculars.  Worth every dollar at this low price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth every dollar", "unixReviewTime": 1326153600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2012"}
