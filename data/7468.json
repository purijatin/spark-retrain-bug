For the money, they're a great buy, but I regret not going for the Bushnell Nature View ones that are supposed to magnify light to look at feathers and such. I also wear glasses and they don't comply with those to the best extent. I would say these are a good secondary pair of binoculars to leave in your car or ones to bring when you don't want to worry about ruining them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the money, but not the greatest", "unixReviewTime": 1262304000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2010"}
