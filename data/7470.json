I was genuinely surprised at the quality. They are heavy (from a quality standpoint, not a cumbersome one) and solidly built. They open and focus smooth and fluid-like. The image is crisp and crystal clear. I am very pleased. For $19, these are as nice as any $50-$60 compact binoculars I've ever used. The right eye piece focuses independent to compensate for one weaker eye, as is my case. Of course with any compact binoculars you sacrifice wide-angle and light gathering power. They are best suited for daylight viewing. Well worth the price.In the box: Binoculars, neck-strap, soft case, lens cloth & instructions.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value.
