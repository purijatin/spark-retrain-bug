My grandson wants to use them to look at birds and wildlife. They are powerful, but the nicest factor is that they are so lightweight when hanging around your neck. No one wants a dead weight! The case is very lightweight which is all that we wanted, so if you want something more substantial you might want to purchase a different case, for example an inexpensive camera case. The case doesn't detract enough from the quality of the binoculars to warrant a lower star level.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful and Lightweight", "unixReviewTime": 1356739200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012"}
