They focus well and fold/pivot to fit in the case they come with. You really cannot buy anything for $13 and expect it to perform like these binoculars. I heard some people got a pair with a defect out of the box, but mine are great. The case is great because it can loop onto a belt and they even come with a cheap (it will probably snap eventually) neck strap and a piece of felt to clean the lenses. I mean, for $13 what more do you want. I will be using these for turkey hunting, where I do not want a large set of binoculars swinging around my neck and therefore blocking access to calls or gear. I needed something basic to see birds off the in the distance or scout a path through the woods, which these are perfect for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "More than affordable, all you need from basic binocular", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013"}
