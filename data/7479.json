They fold into a compact size that fits in pocket or purse and they have the right power.  If you want a binocular for sports or if you usually sit in the fourth balcony of large theaters or arena shows you might want to get something more powerful but for most live events you will be happy with these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for concerts", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}
