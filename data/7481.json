I've seen people pay more for toy binoculars for a kid. I got these for on my motorcycle where space is a premium and they are small and do the job. Easy to carry with you too because they have a case that attaches to your belt. I would recommend them to anyone who has ever needed binoculars and not had a pair with them because they are too big or heavy to carry. Just dump these in your wife's purse or in the glove compartment in case you need them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not the best optics but very portable and afordable.", "unixReviewTime": 1349654400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2012"}
