More than what I expected. Nice weight and balance. Very comfortable eye pieces. It came with a carrying case and cloth to clean the lens. I can see for miles. Can't wait to take these to a sporting event. I'll be up close and personal! No gripes, just go with it! Very pleased with this purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Ok, I'm happy!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1344384000, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2012"}
