They are not quite twice the size of most compact nocs, but the size difference is not a real issue, considering how well they work! They are not too heavy or too big for my needs (concerts & sports). Highly recommend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NICE!", "unixReviewTime": 1357084800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2013"}
