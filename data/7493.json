It worked very well at an indoor venue where I had pretty good seats.  I could see Adam Levine perfectly! However, at a large music festival, it did not work well. I could hardly see the performer and it seemed to focus on people in the crowd rather than the performer.  On the plus side, it is small and fits in my purse. I would say that the 8x21 would be good for concerts where you have really good seats and performances where it is a small venue (not a large music festival or if you are way in the back).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I wish I had bought something stronger than 8 x 21", "unixReviewTime": 1379980800, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2013"}
