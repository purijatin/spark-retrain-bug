Using these 16 x 32 binoculars is like viewing through lenses held by someone with Parkinson's Disease - very shaky! I kept checking my hands - which didn't feel shaky at all - to make sure they weren't actually shaking, and they weren't. Later I read that binoculars with higher magnification produce very shaky images unless the binoculars are held still as with a tripod.Worse, you have to constantly adjust these if you try to view to the  left, right, towards you, or farther away. In short, a pain in the butt. I get eye strain and headaches after just a minute or 2 of using these. A waste of money. No, I won't buy a tripod; I bought these because they were cheap and because I didn't want to spend much money for the limited viewing I'd be (hopefully) doing. I ordered a pair of 10 x 50, and will see how they work out....", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "higher magnification makes for shaky viewing", "unixReviewTime": 1372118400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2013"}
