It is a high quality product that works well, for a very reasonable price.  I bebated between this 12x25 higher magnification and a lower power Bushnell.  The issue was a smaller view with higher mag and more optical leverage and shake than the lower power.This higher power binocular was not too much magnification.  In fact, a lesser power would be too weak.  This unit has the needed power to really get a closeup view.  I would think the lower mag would disapoint most people.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}
