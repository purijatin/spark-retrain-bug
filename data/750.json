It has a touch screen and Windows 8 installed.  However, it does not have an optical drive (too small of a footprint).  To load some of my favorite programs requires a CD/DVD drive.  This unit meets that need very nicely.  It is effective, quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one USB cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very efficient", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}
