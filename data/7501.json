They seemed perfect for what I was wanting, according to the description and published specs.  But, they saw very little service because of the difficulty finding the target, keeping it steady, and focusing.  Focusing was extremely hard.  We could not use them at all and we both tried.  A more expensive and higher quality binocular may have worked.  Even an inexpensive 7X50 would have been okay for what I wanted.  Bushnell makes good stuff, but this 10X32 binocular did not work for us.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not for me..", "unixReviewTime": 1295481600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2011"}
