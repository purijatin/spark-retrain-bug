I know these are normally used for sports or nature, though I didn't have to climb on the roof which they wouldn't allow. You will find the major portion of my reviews rate the product high. We don't have much money, so I spend a lot of time researching a reviewing articles before purchasing, so far this has worked and we have been very happy with 99% of our purchases.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Used while looking at houses to buy", "unixReviewTime": 1339200000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2012"}
