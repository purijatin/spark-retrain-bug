Binos arrived with the common problem of being out of alignment, so a few stars lost there. But, with the good price, I just fixed them myself. The thing that impresses me the most about these is the field of view is one third greater than the new Bushnell 10x50 binos that I bought at the same time. Also, the 8x is about right, the 10x are a bit jittery. Very convenient to use, just pull out of the pouch, no lens caps to deal with. But the wide angle view puzzles me, since my other 10x50 is literally &#34;Wide Angle&#34; binos! Hope this helps someone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mixed review", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}
