They are not a great bargain, but neither are they cheap junk.  For an every day carry or knock around in the car or Jeep, just perfect.  When you lose them or your kid drops them in the lake, no big deal, just buy a new pair.Two suggestions:  Buy the 8X25; it is a lot easier to get past the limitations and the 10X25 is hard to keep in focus.  Also, don't look through a good pair of binoculars or you will instantly be $200-$300 poorer.  I have German glass.  You won't ever want to look through them without a large credit balance and an understanding spouse.  I worked extensively with optics and lenses years ago and the more you learn and experience, the more it costs you.  And not just a little bit.  To get that last bit of quality out of lenses cost 2-3 times as much.Trust me, you are better off not knowing what you are missing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "These are worth what you pay.", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"}
