For the size, I was surprised how far I could see through it. This product can be used in a number fun activities like hiking or shooting targets. It can also be a nice addition to a survival kit--whether it's for practical reasons or apocalypse survival. For the price, this is a great product. I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice to have", "unixReviewTime": 1357776000, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2013"}
