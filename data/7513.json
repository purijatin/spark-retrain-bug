Scott", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewtext": "Apparently I am a slow learner in that by this stage of my life, I should have long since learned that you get what you pay for.  Based on some great reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase a pair of these binoculars.As I lifted them out of the case, a plate that covers the bottom of the focuser immediately dropped to the floor.  I assumed that it was something that snapped into place, but alas, it is apparently (supposed to be) glued into place.  Close inspection of the eyepieces revealed uneven fitting between the lens holders and rubber that surrounds them.  Amazingly, they came with no eye piece covers and the thin string that apparently is made to place over your head is a joke - I'm sure that will last only a few sessions.  I did not find the right eyepiece particularly easy to focus and I might add that you had better be prepared to rest these on something if you want an image that you can comfortably view.I found the instructions to be less than adequate.  Probably appropriately, the English version is the 5th set of instructions.  They are written with a microscopic font and are generic in nature not referring to these specific binoculars.  Come on Bushnell, you have been in business long enough to break the code on producing good optical devices.  You failed with this one!I would return them, but for the price it is not worth my time or effort.  It will make good junk drawer fodder.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Another Chinese made piece of junk!", "unixReviewTime": 1327968000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2012"}
