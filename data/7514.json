They far exceed my expectations.  For under $20 buck you cant beet the size and clarity.  they seem well made and have a nice rubber coating over the metal.  They are very easy to focus.  I'm able to spot birds and squires in the forest easily that I cannot see with the naked eye. I am truly amazed at the quality of these lenses.  I go on many hiking trips and we shall see how well they hold up to the north Georgia mountains.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1329523200, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2012"}
