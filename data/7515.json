I thought of not spending a lot of money, but in the end I had to buy a more expensive binocular.These are not bad optically. However, they are extremely cheaply build. Mine was broken on arrival. On first use, I was able to pull out one eyepiece which included one lens element. This was definitely not by design. It seems eyepiece thread was not there or broken. No force was needed to pull out the eyepiece.Amazon was good at handling the return, but I decided not to try my luck with another. I just bought Olympus Roamer 8x21. Three times the money, but I would say three times the build quality.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}
