With contacts, as in bare eyes, I found the eye relief to be a huge problem in getting binocular vision, as in both eyes. Was mostly getting monocular vision, and had to do a lot of adjustment every time to get binocular vision. So no, small is not always better.Magnification is really good, field of view is poor, which i knew. Optics are good, fully coated.I wouldnt pay retail for these, glad i got a marketplace item for 12-13$", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "too small, tiny even, eye relief is a significant problem", "unixReviewTime": 1347321600, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2012"}
