For reference you can read a registration plate clearly from about 50 yards away.  Youre not going to be able to see craters on the moon but they do work well for a cheap little pair of binoculars. They are fully adjustable width wise and have the focus knob that is easy to use.  Sometimes I find it easier to use just one eye with the binoculars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent pair of binoculars for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1381449600, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2013"}
