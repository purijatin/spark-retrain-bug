The magnification works really great.  It's really small which has it's benefits, but also drawbacks.Due to it's size, I can easily fit it in my pocket which makes it easier to lug around, especially if you already have enough of other things to tote around.  However, it also means that the amount of area you can see is smaller than if you had bigger lenses.  It's ok from a magnification standpoint, it's more about how wide and tall of a picture you want to see at once.  Because of this, I tend to look through it to see something like players up close, when they are between plays.  For game action, I tend not to use it because of the limited width I can see when I need to see large chunks of the field simultaneously.Overall, it's a great deal for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Work Good for the Value, Really Tiny", "unixReviewTime": 1374969600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2013"}
