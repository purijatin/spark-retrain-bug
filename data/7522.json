These are a halfway decent pair of binoculars but don't expect a whole lot. They are pretty small and compact. They also come with a nice case to store them. These binoculars can fit in the palm of your hand. I paid like $12 for mine. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for these. When I first started using them I was kinda impressed until I found out my digital camera had a better and clearer zoom. These would be ok if your at a sporting event but I wouldn't go bird watching or anything with these. Depending on how much your trying to spend would determine if I recommend them. For kids they would be pretty good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "there decent", "unixReviewTime": 1363392000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2013"}
