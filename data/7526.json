I would not hunt w/ these as generally you need a wider field of view and more light, but they are decent for other stuff like target shooting at less than 50 yards and varmint hunting on your own property.  One thing all readers should realize is that in general you get what you pay for w/ optics.  I also have the Leupold Arcadia's 10x42 in the $200 range.  I use them when hunting and bird/animal watching.  They are simply amazing and worth the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not bad at all for the price paid", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2012"}
