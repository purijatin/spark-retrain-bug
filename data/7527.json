Again, I don't think its the lenses, but how they were installed.  Without taking it apart, I couldn't tell you.The second pair (after amazon so nicely replaced the first pair) I can just get the right side in focus.  But there is no more adjustment to it.  Left side works fine.The reason I'm giving it such a low approval is that it's case doesn't work well.  It's to small and you struggle each time to get them in or out.  If your in a hurry or don't want to take your eyes off of something forget it while it's in the case.It also doesn't have a sturdy neck cord to carry them around your neck.  Recommend replacing the string with something stronger.June 12 and I found a case for the 8x21s It's condor Frag Grenade Pouch! for 6 bucks.  It fits tight and leaves a gap on either side, but the top and bottome are totally covered.SpliceCondor Tactical Single Frag Grenade Pouch", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I think there's some factory assembly problems", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}
