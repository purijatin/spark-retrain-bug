Awesome Bushnell quality. I take these on any trip to the outdoors. I wouldn't really go for higher magnification for hand held binoculars unless u have a very steady hand. Would buy these again", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "bushnell binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2014"}
