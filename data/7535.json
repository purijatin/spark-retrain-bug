These were a little too powerfull for my mother to handle and, for her, the 16x magnification meant they were hard to keep steady without a tripod of some sort.I utlimately went with the Bushnell Natureview 8x40 binoculars. True it's only half the magnification but, in this case for what I needed, less was much better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A bit too strong for casual birding", "unixReviewTime": 1315958400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2011"}
