I have higher-quality, more expensive binoculars and these stack up quite nicely.  I was used to very large binoculars, and upon delivery thought these would be too small and compact to deliver quality results.  I was wrong.  I purchased these for boating and other full-light conditions and have been very impressed with the quality.  If I lost my original pair, I would purchase again immediately.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bushnell Powerview 8x21", "unixReviewTime": 1278460800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2010"}
