I don't know the advanced features on higher-end binoculars, but these are small and perfect for simple tasks.  I can use them without my glasses, as they have the main focus and the diopter adjustment in the right eye.They just barely stretch wide enough for my big head, so some heads might not fit.  I can use them to see the buildings and activity on the opposite side of the bay, and they also bring distant wildlife into view.  Next, I need an image-stabilized, 12x zoom camcorder for better viewing and capture of the sights I'm seeing, but that's going to be 50 times as expensive!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great value for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1209081600, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2008"}
