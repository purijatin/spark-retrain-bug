I bought mine to help look at rifle targets ~100 yards out that are not so easy for me to see through a 3x rifle scope and they work fine.  Width adjustment is sufficient for those with big noggins.Nice and light to toss in the range bag, and they come with a sufficiently little carry pouch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice clear optics, very compact size, competitively priced.", "unixReviewTime": 1356998400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2013"}
