They are really small, but adjust easily so anyone can use them. They focus easily. The binocular construction seems strong, but the case is sloppy and weak. Though I've only strapped them on a dozen times, the case already has a wear hold near the belt loop. I'd definitely recommend them, even though I'll probably end up having to buy another case to hold them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}
