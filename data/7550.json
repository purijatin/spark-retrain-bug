I ordered one pair of these and one pair of the Tasco binoculars of the same size.  The Tascos are better.In fact, the first pair of these I ordered I had to send back because the collimation was completely off.  So bad that even with adjustment they couldn't be fixed.So the new pair came in today and they have problems, but I'll keep them.  The focal points of the lenses vary--that is, the bottom of the scene will be in focus while the top won't be.  I have to constantly refocus and only the exact center of the view is in focus at any one time.If you must go with binoculars this cheap, go with the Tascos; the ones I got at least were much clearer and better.The real problem with these ultra cheap binoculars is their lack of quality control and their lack of durability.  I would suggest you throw these in the back of your truck as \"beaters\" but they simply will not stand up to any bouncing, dropping, or banging around.  The plastic parts barely fit together and work as is; any rough treatment will render them useless.Binoculars--unless used as toys--are precision instruments.  There is unfortunately no way to make them cheaply and still have them serve the function for which they were intended.  These Bushnells are fine for the most basic of tasks, but they are not pleasurable nor rewarding to use.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Quite mediocre", "unixReviewTime": 1278115200, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2010"}
