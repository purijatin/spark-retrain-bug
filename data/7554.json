We keep it by the kitchen window, and find ourselves using it at least once a week to peek at a feathered friend who is visiting.  Nice clear lens, pretty easy to find objects through them.  Certainly does the job we need it to do.  Don't buy this if you do your birding out in the field - these are not particularly portable nor leightweight and are not meant to be; buy a binocular specifically made for that purpose.Only complaint, and it is minor, is that I find the lens caps to be flimsy and a little hard to use.  We generally just keep them off.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for backyard birding", "unixReviewTime": 1169596800, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2007"}
