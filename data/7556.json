This is a superior set. Easy to adjust, powerful, in fact too powerful for our backyard feeders, we use the compact pair for the yard, and save this for the beach and bird walks. Bushnells are not super compact, but the compact 8 x40 model I bought is going on Ebay this week.good buy, should last another twenty years.If you are a new birder,keep it simple, buy these and several birdbooks, have fun.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1160524800, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2006"}
