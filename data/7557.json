And have been satisfied with only a couple.  These binoculars I am very pleased with. The clarity is very good and the price is terrific.  I have wasted alot of money on some not so good Bushnell binoculars. But this pair was a pleasant surprise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1153699200, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2006"}
