Well, I've found a number of uses for 'em.  I use 'em for casual birding in Central Park - I'm even on an internet mailing list that tells me when unusual birds have stopped through.I take 'em to the opera and the symphony too!  If you can't afford the $350 seats, these binocs help to bring the nuances of the performance into your range of vision.  Amazing to check out the sets and the instruments as well.And finally these are my constant companion in the nosebleed seats at Yankee Stadium!  I think Clemens keeps some kind of powder in his glove...I really appreciate the rubber eyecups and the long eye relief - I can use these with my glasses on without fear of scratches.  If you want to view with your glasses off, there is a diopter ring on the left eyepiece to dial in your correction.  Focusing is smooth and easy and so is adjustment of interpupillary distance.Lightweight, great optical quality (if not perfect, certainly fully adequate), and finally, the price is right!  I recommend these binoculars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What these eyes have seen..", "unixReviewTime": 1051833600, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2003"}
