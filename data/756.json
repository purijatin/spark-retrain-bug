I was very pleased when this arrived, and it didn't need any set up. All I had to do was hook it to the laptop, and it worked very smoothly and easily. This is a solidly good product, and for a good price, and so far it is working very well. However I felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working, so the user has to be a little careful with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}
