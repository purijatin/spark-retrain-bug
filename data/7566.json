I got this for my wife as a Christmas gift as she was wanting to be able to see the &#34;critters&#34; in the woods on our property better. They do a good job, but the process of getting them set up and focused for a certain individual is rather tedious and hard to remember. It's a bit of a pain to have to read instructions every time you want to look at something because use is infrequent. I would recommend them, but only for a regular, experienced user.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality and performance is great", "unixReviewTime": 1358640000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2013"}
