I bought a pair that arrived with the objective lenses out of whack, so you always see two images of everything.  I sent them back to Amazon and got a replacement pair.  The second pair had the exact same problem as the first pair.I sent the second pair to Bushnell, who told me they were messed up (duh?).  They would replace them for a $50 fee (what?), so I went with that.  The third pair arrived direct from Bushnell, and the right-hand forward lens and tube were lying in the box, separated from the main body of the binoculars.  I contacted Bushnell again, had to forward pictures, and they sent me a forth pair.  The fourth pair had the exact same problem as the first two, so I threw them in the trash and bought Leupold.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Buyer beware!!! - Don't waste your time or money on these!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}
