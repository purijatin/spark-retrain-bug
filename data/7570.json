Binocular users don't usually realize what they're missing until they check out Nikon or Minolta binocs. The images focus into crystal clarity but the price is close to a hundred or more bucks. But it's like a digital camera. It doesn't matter what the features are if the images are crappy.The lenses in these binocs have rings around the inner perimeter that are always out of focus. The center image is pretty good until you compare it with better binoculars, then there are more colors, a brighter image and, of course, consequently, greater viewing pleasure.Also, like most lens caps on binoculars, the lens caps on these should be discarded with the plastic wrap and box. They fall off with gravity and you'll soon lose them anyway.This one's a good model for kids. For yourself, use your tax cut and buy a more expensive model. If you're going to walk 12 miles into the woods, you deserve to have primo optics.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Well Designed, Poor Optics", "unixReviewTime": 1097280000, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2004"}
