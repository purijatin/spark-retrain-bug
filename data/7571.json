Dull images were out of focus and I could never get the pair to \"focus\" correctly. I had such high hopes as I remember Bushnell being superior quality.  Not any more. The optics are so bad, I was literally seeing double images.  Do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this product.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "If you like inferior optics - then buy one!", "unixReviewTime": 1313366400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2011"}
