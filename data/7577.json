Leonard", "helpful": [9, 13], "reviewtext": "These binoculars were sent back for refund....I own a pair of bushnell 16x50 binoculars and they work just fine, but I wanted to get something that was a little stronger, so I purchased the 20x50 and after receiving them I was disappointed in them because they would not focus clearly. I followed the instructions on focussing, but they just would not focus well enough to see things clearly. There were parts that seemed to be loose and when using the focus rocker I could see the two lens wobbling. These were just poorly made. I have sent them back to Amazon for a refund.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Bushnell PowerView 20x50 Binculars", "unixReviewTime": 1301875200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2011"}
