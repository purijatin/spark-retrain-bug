Martin \"NASCAR Geek and IT Nerd.....\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "I bought these to use for sporting events, occasional bird watching and nature viewing.  They meet my expectations as it relates to functionality.  I've had no issues with double vision or other optical abnormalities.  They are a value purchase for me (cheap enough to replace it damaged or lost) so I am satisfied overall.Ours came with a basic case and a relatively sturdy neck strap.  Nothing fancy but wasn't expecting anything fancy.  Bought directly from Amazon.com and item arrived quickly and without problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for the monney, and improved over older reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1309824000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2011"}
