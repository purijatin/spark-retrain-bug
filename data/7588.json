These binoculars are incredible! I have them on my table at all times to watch birds with, and they go with me on any hike or camping trip I take.The initial setup is super-easy, and once you do that, they are some of the best I've used for tracking down and focusing on a moving object.  A quick finger-toggle slides the focus for you without losing track of what you're looking at. I've in fact bought many sets of these binoculars for friends and family as gifts because they were so useful for me, and now I have a wide following addicted to these binoculars.The image of course is fantastic, well lit and good sized!If you have any sort of interest in nature, astronomy, sports, or just about anything else which involves viewing objects at a distance, these are definitely the binoculars to try. You won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible value for birders, astronomers, etc.", "unixReviewTime": 973641600, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2000"}
