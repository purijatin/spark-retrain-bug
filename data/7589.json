I heard someone saying its got to be with the alignment of the glass inside and that high power binocular are more difficult to get this alignment done properly but its a waste of my time thank god not of money that because a product is bad i have to spend time on buying this pair of binocular and then send them back. hopefully if you buy them they are good then I'm pretty sure it will be awesome because i like the power they offer and how much light come through the lens. Go ahead and try your luck hopefully even if they are good they last long.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Mine was bad as other reported", "unixReviewTime": 1331164800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2012"}
