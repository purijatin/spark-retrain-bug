Hanson", "helpful": [13, 14], "reviewtext": "I wanted some binoculars for astronomical viewing that were a little more powerful than my 10x50's, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I settled on these, and have not been disappointed. Within it's range of magnification, it delivers good, well defined images of the moon and nearer planets. Jupiter's moons are quite visible on a clear night. Some astronomy buffs suggest an aperture of 70mm or more for binoculars, but if your object is to view nearby planets and not far away galaxy clusters or the outer planets, these should be fine.It also offers clear and well defined landscape views in daylight. However they're not  water or fog proof, a point to keep in mind if going hiking or camping. Also, your hand motion( as well as images you see)is magnified by 20x, so a tripod or stand is needed for best viewing results.All in all, a good buy for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1287014400, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2010"}
