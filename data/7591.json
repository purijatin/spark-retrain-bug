I could tell that right off the bat the optics were poor.  There was a double image produced and no level of correcting fixed the situation.  I have a small portable pair of 10 x 25 binoculars.  I was hoping the additional light I would get through the larger lenses and the extra 2x would make a difference.  But I did not experience that.  I noticed that they did not get me any additional closeness that you would expect and any light gains were minimal at best.  They are not bad, but size wise you might be justified sticking with a 10 x 25 or going with a 10 x 50 because you won't notice the gains.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I think I got a bad pair, but this is what I found out.", "unixReviewTime": 1371686400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2013"}
