However, the one 20x50 that I received had a somewhat very bad case of blurry lens (for me at least,) but just the left one. So I returned it and got the full refund from Amazon, including shipping. It took some work to ship it back but it was really a simple and straightforward process, which makes me confident buying from Amazon again. I ended up buying the Pentax 20x60 which is excellent but not perfect. The most important thing for me is clarity (brightness) and sharpness (in both eyes, of course.) So, the build is important, durability and overall quality if very important, but the most important thing is getting a clear, sharp image. I believe this binocular can deliver but not my copy. I would like to try another copy but now I have the Pentax which so much better.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Left lens blurry", "unixReviewTime": 1251331200, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2009"}
