Fulton", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I never thought that selecting binoculars would have so many variables. The great number of manufactures and resultant types of binoculars is amazing. Selection takes time and effort and then you wonder if a correct selection had been made? My requirement was for viewing baseball games which meant for me a wide-field-of- view and easy focusing. I must say so far that the Bushnell binoculars have met my needs over the past few months. My only advice is to read all Amazon reviews and literature regarding what you want to view and then make your selection at the price you desire to pay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Met my requirements", "unixReviewTime": 1401148800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014"}
