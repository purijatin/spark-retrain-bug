For the price, the images are sharp.  I was totally shocked to see the beauty of Pleiades with my 10x50s, which then, prompted me to get the 20s.  Either way, these binoculars are great for those like myself who are just beginning to skygaze.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Binos For Price!", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}
