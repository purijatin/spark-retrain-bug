However, they didn't turn out to be.  The binos arrived with one of the lenses bent inward significantly.  I returned them to amazon with no hassle.  The representative who helped me over the phone was very nice and even sent me a replacement the very next day.  The replacement binos seemed fine at first but then I noticed that the lenses were slightly crooked.  So when viewing an object, both eyes have different perspectives which creates a blurred view.  The only way to view an object clearly is to keep one eye closed.  I would return these too, but I threw away the manufacturer's packaging.  I wouldn't recommend these.  If I had to do it all over again, I would pay a little more for something better.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not so great.", "unixReviewTime": 1220140800, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2008"}
