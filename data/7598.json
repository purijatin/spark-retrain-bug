This is my third pair of Bushnell Binoculars, this is my favorite. Oddly the compact folding Bushnells have about 30% wider view. Want to mention this about this model, is it my eyes? or do these seem to only focus in the middle of field of view, with the outer half or more out of focus? The other two pair are 8x21 and 7-15x35 that i have and do not seem to have this problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}
