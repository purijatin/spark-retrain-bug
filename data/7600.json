Made sure the interpupillary distance and the diopter were set correctly and the binoculars still produced a double image. The factory seals on the package indicate these were not previously returned or tampered with. They either slipped past quality control, or were somehow knocked out of alignment during shipping.Binoculars that can't handle a 2 day trip in shipping aren't durable enough for field use, and if they left the factory like that, QC needs to be more vigilant. In any case they are unusable in this condition.It's a shame because they otherwise appear to be good build quality. The fit and finish was nice. But I need to look through them, not just look at them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Optics misaligned", "unixReviewTime": 1369872000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2013"}
