And the image is very bright. If you are looking for a good binocular and don't want to sacrifice the brightness and wide angle, this one should be a very good choice. But it is not good for taveling/hiking, still a little bulky.For those with old binoculars, perhaps it is time to buy this one as substitute. It will surprise you!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much better than expected!", "unixReviewTime": 983318400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2001"}
