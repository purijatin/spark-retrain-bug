Colascione", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I recently bought a pair of these Bushnell PowerView 12X50 Binoculars and have been quite happy with them. The quality is good and the price from Amazon was great. The feel of them is good, not to light and not to heavy. I like the 12X50 fixed power and they focus very well with the \"InstaFocus\"lever. Looking through them I get a very clear bright view of what ever I'm looking at and the 12 power brings in what ever I'm looking at nice and close. I had another pair of zoom binoculars that were 12X60X70 but they proved to be much too big and powerful for my needs so I sold them and got these and I would defiantly recommend them if your looking for a good general pair of binoculars. Bushnell has been around for a long time and they give a lifetime warranty. It also came with a with a good storage case and although some have reported that the included strap is poor I don't agree and I find it is heavy enough to serve it's purpose of hanging it around your neck. I've had a number of pairs of binoculars in my life and I like these and would recommend them. The lens covers are also fine as well and do what their supposed to do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Happy With Purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1253577600, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2009"}
