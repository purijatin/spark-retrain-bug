If such a thing exists. Afterall why buy a 500 dollar set of optics for a teen using these at a sporting event or just rambling around the woods looking for squirrels to shoot. Bought these at a discount {previously opened}from amazon warehousedeals.com. The manufacturers box they came in had seen better days BUT the shipping box and packaging was first rate. Got them for rougly 50percent of the retail price and was quite aware of packaging issue prior to purchase. They were dissassembled upon arrival...I found that odd, so I put them together and really looked them over and they appear flawless. Im not a optics expert...most of my optics revolve around the shooting sports and THEY JUST HAVE TO WORK as advertised. These do work as advertised.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Binos", "unixReviewTime": 1286928000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2010"}
