They weren't that bad, but nothing to write home about. About worth $20 less than I paid. They aren't heavy so that is a plus. The quick focus was nice as well as the rubber grip. Would be good for bird watching if you are semi-close to the birds. You hardly get what you pay for here. I might have been expecting too much though. They were very solid and rigid.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Worth the price, not much more", "unixReviewTime": 1364860800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2013"}
