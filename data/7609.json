They are difficult to hold steady and difficult keep focused.  The Powerview 20x60 model has 25% more magnification, so I assume it's 25% more difficult to hold them steady and 25% more difficult to keep them focused.  The Zip focus is a handy feature.  You'll need it!  I find myself refocusing the 16x50's all the time.  For the same price, I think a good pair of 10x50's would be easier to use and provide better image quality.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Review of similar model, Powerview 16x50", "unixReviewTime": 1335571200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2012"}
