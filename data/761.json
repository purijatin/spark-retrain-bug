However, when I opened the package, it was a brand new LG drive! I was very thrilled to get that for only $25. The drive is very thin and made of aluminum. The drive features a slide-tray and works decently. I used it to install Microsoft Office 2007 and Star Wars Battlefront II on my Asus T101MT tablet pc without any issues. Plus, LG is a name-brand you can trust! I highly recommend this DVD drive as you get the best bang for you buck!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It is made by LG and works great!", "unixReviewTime": 1325894400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2012"}
