Primarily so I can be as far away from a hazmat scene as possible. The magnification is excellent for this purpose. The reason I did not rate it a 4 or 5 is the focus mechanism. Focus and clarity are very important to me. There are two bars that adjust the two separate rear eye pieces (I'm sure they have a real name) near or far focus. the bars are very flexible and it causes the two separate eye pieces to have out of sync focus when they are pressed even slightly. I doubt the extra expense of using inflexible plastic or even metal would add a s much as $2.00 to the retail price. As for the glass, the clarity is only slightly less than the quality I observed in a $2000 pair of binoculars at the gun store. At this magnification, it goes without saying ( but i will anyway) a mono pod or tripod is necessary to avoid a shaky image. fix the focus and I'll give it a 5", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "hazmat and fire service binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1367020800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2013"}
