It's my second Bushnell and 15 years down the pike it's still as well made as my first, a 7 x 35. This hasn't been my experience with most products, which are getting flimsier with every year that goes by.  OTOH, my 8 x 25 Minolta at 4x the money developed a major flaw almost right away-- just pathetic.  The 10 x 50 is great for birding-- the field is so wide you can actually follow the bird as it flits away.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value", "unixReviewTime": 1333670400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2012"}
