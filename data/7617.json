We wanted DHCP but didn't need wireless. Needed another one so went with a familiar product and also to keep similar equipment. We subsequently purchased one more router but - due to timing, stock, and availability of newer products - we went with a different model (WRT160NL or E2500, I think). All still worked well. Didn't have to use customer support; don't know how to rate advertising except that it seemed accurate; I have no idea about components and didn't really care since it worked.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good For Temporary Private Network At Conference", "unixReviewTime": 1313366400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2011"}
