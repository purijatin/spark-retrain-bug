However, what I found more attractive was how easy it was to setup right out of the box. Even though I was connecting a single boot Windows XP and a dual-boot Win 2000/Red Hat 7.2  machine, setup was no problem.Administering the unit is as easy as opening up a browser and typing in the unit's IP address. What you'll like in this feature is that while it allows expert users to configure advanced settings, newbies will not have any problem setting up the router for regular day-to-day operations including not only surfing but sharing files, printers etc. I'm actually thinking of extending this with the Wireless version of this router. That way, I can have wireless internet access on a laptop throughout my house!Since we are going into the age of multiple computers in every house with a broadband connection, this is a must have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy set up and administration", "unixReviewTime": 1006992000, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2001"}
