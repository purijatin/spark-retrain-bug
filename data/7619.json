'I purchased this July '02, and 10 years later this little box is still fully functional.  I bought it for my SOHO to share a DSL internet, which I had configured to share the internet among three PCs plus a network printer.  At the time, the 10/100 switch was the fastest and affordable consumer switch available.  Currently, I have it configured as a switch (router feature disabled) for several linux-based file servers, and I have it mounted under a shelf in the closet.  I do not need a fast LAN for this purpose, and since the backup is \"automatic\" I do not need to manage them (I remote administer the Linux boxes) and I forgot about this switch.  No restarts required.  No maintenance.  The only time I had to restart it was when I configured it from router to switch 8 years ago.  This does not seem to be available for a new retail purchase, but I feel compelled to give it an excellent review for the entire time I' ve had it and used it.  If it was still available, I would recommend it.  Just understand that it is a 10/100 BaseT and not a gigabit router.  There are newer and updated versions, but this has not failed me once.  It fully deserves a 5 star rating. I would give it more, if the option was available.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Non-stop use for 10 years, still working, still being used.
