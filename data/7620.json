I looked around at a lot of different routers, and this one seemed to be just what we needed.  It is compact in design and was super easy and very quick to install; the installation wizard is practically fool-proof.  I am very pleased with this router, and we are surfing the web on either computer and simultaneously on both computers with no problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic for a sharing a broadband connection.", "unixReviewTime": 1134864000, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2005"}
