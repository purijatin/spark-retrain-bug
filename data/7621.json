It has been flawless handling my VPN connection to work.  An issue I was never able to sort out with the D-Link router before it.This router performed great right out of the box.  It was setup in 5 minutes with the IE based config menu.It has no problem handling multiple network devices to my DSL modem.  I push the connection very hard with Internet Radio and the VPN-work transfers.Well worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great router for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1107216000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2005"}
