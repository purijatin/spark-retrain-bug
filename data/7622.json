I seemed to intermittently lose both Internet and Email (Outlook Express) access.  Linksys technical support quickly diagnosed the problem as incompatibility between my old Linksys router and Vista; since the old router was out of warranty, they offered to fix the problem for almost as much as a new one would cost.  Clearly, it made more sense to get a new one, which has a 2 year warranty.  The only problem is that old and new have the same model number; they key is the version, whicn none of the retailers including Amazon list or even know.  However, it turns out that virtually any unit shipped in the last year or so, will work with Vista.  I had to use Linksys technical support to get the link to the online patch that enabled me to install this one -- forget about the installation disc -- and everything is again working.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Windows Vista", "unixReviewTime": 1186272000, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2007"}
