All my fixes were performed by myself with little effort. As far as a firmware upgrade....I read that this should only be done when the router is not working as needed and should not be done just for the sake of being up to date. Linksys makes good products. I have there cable modem, hub and also a wireless router. Not only do there work great but I love the blue colors they use. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top Rating", "unixReviewTime": 1090972800, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2004"}
