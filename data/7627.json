From that respect, it's a good unit, nice interface, easy to set up, and reasonably reliable.If, on the other hand, you're part of the infamous &quot;other 10%&quot; who want to do some hosting, forward some ports, or run some fancy internet-based applications, you should probably move up to a professional-quality router.  There are only a limited number of forwarding and triggering commands you can put in (which seems to be a limit of the interface, not necessarily of the hardware).  The product also lacks a number of would-be-useful features such as blocking out hostile IP addresses, forwarding ports based on host header, remote access from outside of your local network, and any kind of reporting/status indicators that would assure you the firewall is in fact even working.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Probably the one for you...", "unixReviewTime": 1015459200, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2002"}
