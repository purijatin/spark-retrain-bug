It made setting up my own home network a snap.  Now all my computers can share the same T1 line, as well as each other's files.  Additionally, it provides the security of a hardware firewall!  I can specify which ports are open to which computers, rendering the computers MUCH more protected from the outside internet.  Plus, the router is small and easily sits on top of my subwoofer.  You can't go wrong buying this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use, works just like the box says it would!", "unixReviewTime": 981590400, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2001"}
