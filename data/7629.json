Changing SMTP server, or computer I was sending from, or email program all fixed the problem, but that wasn't good enough.  I returned the Linksys and got the Netgear web-safe router, which didn't have this problem.  Also one time it locked up completely and I had to pull the plug.  Other than that I liked the product quite a lot -- it was trivial to set up and the web interface was nice to use.  Also I've got friends who have no problems with it, so it must have been something about my setup which triggered some obscure bug.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Locks up sending attachments", "unixReviewTime": 1013990400, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2002"}
