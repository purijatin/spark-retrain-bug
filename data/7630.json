The documentation states that you have to disable DHCP to enable port forwarding, but I've found this to be incorrect: you can still forward to a specific local IP address, if you've given that particular machine a static IP.  I just picked a particular address for my Linux server (e.g. 192.168.0.100), and forward port 80 to it; the other machines can still get their addresses via DHCP.  Even if it were true that you had to disable DHCP to do port forwarding, this doesn't mean you can't support multiple machines - you can always assign static IP addresses to your machines.  This is easy: just make them up, as long as they're in the local subnet range (by default, 192.168.0.xx, where xx is from 1 to 255 - I suggest starting at 100 to avoid conflict with DHCP), and set that address in your computer's network settings.  Pick different ones for each computer, of course.I suspect that the &quot;you must disable DHCP&quot; business has more to do with keeping people from getting themselves in trouble by setting up port forwarding to dynamically assigned addresses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great -- and DOES let you host a site", "unixReviewTime": 1023062400, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2002"}
