I opened the box of the Linksys 4-port Cable/DSR Router, plugged in the cables, turned it on, and EVERYTHING WORKED! I'm shocked speechless. What, no endless calls to tech support? No having the manufacturer blame the ISP and the ISP blame Microsoft? No frustration, no yelling, no imprecations to God to smite the evil User Guide Authors? Plug, plug, power on, click [Apply], click [OK]; I'm done!Seriously, I am a consultant who has lived in fear of networking my three home PCs for years. The very thought of IP addresses and subnet masks makes me itch. This entire setup actually took ONE commercial break from start to finish, and this is the ONLY computer product of ANY kind that has ever had that happen in my houseThis is the best, most satisfying product experience I've ever had. The only down side is, if everyone in the industry did it like Linksys, what would those awful tech support people do for a living? The Post Office is fully staffed and Cruella D'Evil only needs one assistant. I guess they could work for the phone company... Do yourself a great favour: BUY THIS BOX!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Shocked and Appalled!", "unixReviewTime": 984096000, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2001"}
