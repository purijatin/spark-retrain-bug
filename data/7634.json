Now I have it hooked to my DSL connection using the PPPoE feature and that works great too. My DSL connection will occasionally drop, but I assume that is a timeout in the PPP settings on the ISP side.I've never had to contact customer support, however so I can't comment on that aspect. (I also have a Linksys PCMCIA combo card that works beautifully, with both Windoze 98 and Linux.)April 2003 update: This product is still going strong, though occasionally the diagnostic light comes on, requiring a power-cycle. I should probably upgrade the firmware, but I haven't been inconvenienced too much by this.December 2004 update: Still going strong with original firmware.November 2005 update: Not used anymore, since I went wireless, but I have updated the firmware and tested it and it still works!March 2008 update: I lent it to a friend who confirms it still works fine!April 2009 update: This device is now protecting another home network! 8 years and going strong - no wonder Cisco bought Linksys!July 2010 update: It's still working!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked flawlessly for 8 years with cable modem and DSL", "unixReviewTime": 984441600, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2001"}
