I went then with the manual approach, which was pretty straightforward.By the way, for those who are new to the networking I'd recommend to try running a useful configuration utility program \"winipcfg\" from Start->Run command. It will display all those IP, Subnet Mask, Gateway and DNS addresses, which you will need during the installation. No calling your ISP is necessary at this point. After clicking the \"More info\" button, it will show you everything you need. Just make sure that in pull down menu you see the name of your Ethernet Adapter that is used for your high speed connection, not AOL or PPP for example. It should be displayed there by default, though.If you already have firewall software on your PC, you can still use it after the router's installation as an additional security from within your system. If you don't have it, you need to get one. Router itself shields you pretty well only from the outside intruders. And don't forget to disable firewall during the router's installation.As a new user of this router I'm giving it my highest ratings for the price and currently very good performance.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Network novices - don't be afraid", "unixReviewTime": 1022284800, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2002"}
