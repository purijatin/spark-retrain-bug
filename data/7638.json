Very easy setup for Mac (although I had to call tech support, as the manual only addresses PCs). The device serves my computer, Netflix Roku player and Xbox console. One time the signal stopped and I had to unplug/plug in the device to reset it. Then I found out there's a reset button in the back of the router. A friend said it's not unusual to do an occasional reset. But that was the only one so far.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One hiccup, otherwise fine", "unixReviewTime": 1249430400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2009"}
