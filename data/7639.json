I decided to try the Linksys to see if the results would be better.  The Linksys was clearly a superior product.  It provided easier installation, three times the number of features and an intuitive interface.With the Linksys Router if you have one static IP address you can easily host a Web Sever or Email Sever on different machines.  You can easily mix and match dynamic and static IP address behind the router for a large variety of possibilities.  The combination of a router, firewall, proxy services (NAT), DMZ and switch all in once product can potentially save over a thousand dollars in equipment costs.I would strongly recommend to everyone that they change their passwords for security reasons.  Thank you Linksys for building a better mousetrap!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best in Class for Home Use", "unixReviewTime": 982886400, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2001"}
