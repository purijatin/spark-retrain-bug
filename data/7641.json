I am not sure how or why I had problems, or how or why the problems went away.  I have used it both on DSL and now cable.  It works better on Cable.  I actually have a Win 98, Win 2000, Win NT and an iMac all hooked up to it. The documentation that was included is sketchy at best and the online help is not worth looking up.  The hold time for technical support gave me enough time to fix it myself, so I guess support did work.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Trying Set-up", "unixReviewTime": 996710400, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2001"}
