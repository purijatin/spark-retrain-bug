I have a DSL with a static IP, and was regularly bombarded by hackers and CodeRed2 type viruses. Prior to purchasing this router I was using ZoneAlarm software firewall from Zone Labs (a superb software firewall distributed free for personal use). ZoneAlarm was blocking hundreds of attacks every day. After I installed LinkSys 4-port router, ZoneAlarm didn't register even a single attack during past several days (just to prove that the hardware firewall works). Configuring the LinkSys router and my private network was extremely simple - just followed the step-by-step simple instructions provided in the user's manual. My previously configured VPN connecting my home PC to my workplace worked without any additional configuration.  Prior to installing the router I was experiencing sporadic NetBIOS related problems terminating my connectivity to the Internet. My DSL provider was unable to solve the issue. After installing this router, the problem went away.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product!", "unixReviewTime": 997574400, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2001"}
