It is fast, fast, fast!  However, I too have DSL from a provider that supports PPPoE and let me tell you, it pays to have friends who know network architecture!  I am a programmer but a mere developer is no match for this baby.  I worked with Linksys online support and the tech told me the router was defective, and to send it back to Amazon.  I didn't believe him, and my tech friend didn't either.  Ten minutes on the phone and we had it up and running, set to fixed IP addresses for my PCs (not DHCP).  Once its up and running, it is a brave new world.  I would rate it 5 stars if mere mortals could install it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a simple install", "unixReviewTime": 986688000, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2001"}
