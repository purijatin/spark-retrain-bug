Just enter your PPPoE account info and go.  Built-in DHCP server makes home networking easy.VPN works, though you may need to open some ports for gaming, such as Warcraft III.  The only minus is file transfer doesn't work with ICQ, but I think that applies to all routers/firewalls.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "simple setup, works great", "unixReviewTime": 1079568000, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2004"}
