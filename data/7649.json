We prefer the Apple devices for our wireless network, but we run them through this router, because it's more reliable and customizable. It's much easier to open ports with this device than with Apple Devices, not to mention the DMZ capability!The Bad: Sometimes it overclocks and we need to unplug and replug back in, but that's probably my own fault for overclocking it via too many download connections.The Bottom Line: My favorite router to use, great with bittorrent, and a great price, too. I am very pleased with this little device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable, efficient, and great price!", "unixReviewTime": 1330560000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2012"}
