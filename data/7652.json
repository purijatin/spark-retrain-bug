I assume it is v1 because it has been in use for at least a decade, probably longer.  It has been in use so long I honestly forget.  That router has been rock solid all these years and I use the advanced UPnP and port range forwarding features.  You would think the newer version would still be dependable.....  sigh.  Not so.I wanted a router for my mom's home network so I purchased version 4.3 of this router while I am visiting for the holidays.  I read all the negative reviews about the router freezing and the need to cycle power frequently. I decided to give it a chance anyhow given the flawless history of the early version I have at home.  Darn, don't waste your time and money like I did.  The new version really is a PoS like so many reviewers before me have stated.It has been in use for a week now and it is going back to the store today.  I have to cycle power every day, sometimes several times a day.  I have never purchased anything but linksys hubs, switches, routers, modems and WAPs.  Sad, this loyal customer must switch brands because the quality I have enjoyed in the past is no longer built into linksys products, at least this model for sure.  I will try the D-Link DGL-4100 and hope I have better luck.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Returning version 4.3 because it is not reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1196640000, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2007"}
