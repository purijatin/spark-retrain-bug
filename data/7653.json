This wireless craze is nothing but problem - and too much radiation anyway.  It's plug and play, no software required, unless you need the security of a password.  Don't need it with a wired family network.  That's one less quirk to worry about.Bought a wireless Netgear for less money before this and could not get pass word software to work on that either and could not turn off wireless feature.Otherwise this works fine and fast, so I'm leaving well enough alone.  Had to reset (turn it off and on again) once in two weeks because I tried to back out of a secure socket situation.  Don't know if it was this router that was at fault.  But resetting the router fixed it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "solid - wired - but couldn't enter [ unneeded] password", "unixReviewTime": 1271030400, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2010"}
