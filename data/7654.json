I currently have the v2 but the problem I am having is not version specific.  I get disconnected from IRC and any messenger I am using about ever 5 -10 minutes at best.  I have changed the firmware numerous times... I have reset the router I have actually changed the router out to no avail.  This equipment is faulty and Linksys refuses to acknowledge the problem.  If you type in Befsr41+disconnects you will see this is a problem with the entire product line... and most of us can not resolve this without removing this piece of equipment from the equation.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Be leary of the befsr41", "unixReviewTime": 1158796800, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2006"}
