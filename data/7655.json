The critical piece of advice was missing, however, which would otherwise have meant only a 10 minute set-up job.  When connecting as instructed in the manual, you also  have to call mediaOne/RoadRunner to give them the router MAC address.  Unfortunately they asked for the LAN MAC address of the router, which is  the wrong card.  You should give the WAN (Wide area) MAC number to the tech  people, who will add this to your list of MAC addresses.  This is at no  cost! Both MAC addresses are visible on the set-up screen of the router.  Once the correct WAN's MAC address was added to my account (and the modem  is powered down and rebooted), it worked like a charm.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Practical set-up advice", "unixReviewTime": 959299200, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2000"}
