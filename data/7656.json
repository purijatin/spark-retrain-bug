The wireless Linksys works very well.  My connection drops now and then and I thought it might be the SMC because it's several years old and the BEFSR41 might be more compatible.  The problem I had was that I couldn't get the password to reset no matter what I did.  I followed the directions that came with the router and went on the web site to be sure I was doing it properly.  Couldn't reset it to the factory settings and couldn't get access with the easy password I used to set it up.  I think this one was just defective.  My Linksys wireless works great all the time.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "I think the one I received was defective", "unixReviewTime": 1197936000, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2007"}
