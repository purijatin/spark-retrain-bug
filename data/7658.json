Everything was fine until I built a new PC and attempted to set the PPPoE for the new PC. After accessing the Setup Menu and making the necessary changes, everytime I hit \"Save\" I would get the logon/password window, and couldn't get past it.Multiple calls to Linksys Tech Support were routed to India, where I was repeatedly instucted to uselessly reset the modem.  Finally, they told me to RMA the unit.  I was not happy when I discovered I was required to pay for the return shipping of the suspect unit, even though my unit was still under warranty.The replacement unit arrived and I wired it up: SAME PROBLEM. Infuriated, I called again. The guy who answered listened to my description of the problem said \"I know how to fix that\", and had me make one change in Windows: VOILA, it worked.Now I had to return the unnecessary replacement router, again, on my nickel.  When I expressed my frustration with  all the previous CS reps who didn't know the solution, here's the really funny part:  He asked me \"Were you talking to India?\" Yes, I said, and he replied, \"The Indians are all idiots. We're in the Philippines. Next time you have a problem, make sure you're talking to the Philippines.\"Well, there you have it: The Third World at war with itself for America's hearts and minds.  Linksys corporate should be proud. SHEEEEESH!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "GLOBAL OUTSOURCING AT ITS FINEST", "unixReviewTime": 1106438400, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2005"}
