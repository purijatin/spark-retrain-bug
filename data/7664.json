I was using a spare computer as my NAT firewall running Linux and ipmasqadm. Worked fine but because of security concerns that was pretty much what it was being used for. Then I see this router/firewall from a trusted brand for a price hard to believe and a mail in rebate!!! My old linux box is now running as an extra internet station! Took me less than 5 minutes to have the computers on the internet again, and an hour or so to port scan my network and tweak the firewall - installing the newer firmware solved some problems related to open UDP ports. Highly recommended if you have a broadband connection and wants great protection and good value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product, works out of the box, unbeatable price!", "unixReviewTime": 1053648000, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2003"}
