I ended up suggesting it to a very small business that I do some occasional contract work for.  This device is simply outstanding.  If you know nothing about networking you can set this thing up and make it work, and if you know anything more than nothing you'll find it extremely powerful.  You can run public servers, make your network stealth to the Internet, and do full routing functions.  Amazing, I couldn't believe it.OK, it's not a full-fledged firewall.  It is limited, but for a very small busines, or home user this is an excelent sollution as spending $$$ just for the firewall portion is probably not an option.  The other great thing is with 4-ports it doubles as a hub.  I doubt most home users need more than four ports.  So this could very well be the sollution for every home Internet user in America.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is one of the most amazing products...", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
