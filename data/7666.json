Cone", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I had an aging D-link DGL-4300 that went through 5+ years of very heavy use and became unreliable a month and a half ago.  I wanted to replace the router fast so I bit the bullet and bought this linksys BEFSR41 without sufficient research. It is linksys, A well known brand.Big mistake.  This thing is absolutely worthless.  If you research this Router (as I should have) you will find this router is notorious for losing connection.  Occasionally at first, then it starts dropping connection daily, and then by the minute.As I was digging through boxes of computer parts, looking for the power adapter to my mothballed DGL-4300, I was shocked to find an old Gigafast Router I had long forgotten I had.  With the same cables, same computers, and same modem, I placed the Gigafast router into my network and instantly... zero issues, stable connection, and I even did a speed test, and this 6 year old, 20$ , discontinued, and a slight bit slow Gigafast Router vastly outperformed the Linksys BEFSR41 even when my Linksys was brand new and properly functioning a mere two months ago.To further test out the network. I went ahead and placed the DGL-4300 back in the network and found it too, still functioned in the network, how ever sluggishly as it has been worn out and cooked for years.After 5 hours of router swapping, wire swapping, firmware updates and rollbacks, AC adapter tests, various browser tests, cmd prompt tests, I have come to the conclusion that all of my network problems start and end with the Linksys BEFSR41.  Two months old.  Unusable. Unbelievable.Maybe you will be lucky and have no issues, but as I have experienced and researched, in the tech savvy world, this product is a well-derided piece of garbage.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Avoid.
