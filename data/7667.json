Johnson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Thanks to this my 3 PC's share the same Fast DSL access and I also can access any computer on my network from any other computer.  I had a little problem setting it up with my ISP but Linksys's technical support was more than helpful on getting everything working.  I have not have ANY (not ONE) problem with this router since.  I even had to wipe out my hard drives because one of my computer frequently crashes (another problem) and everytime I reload the OS and peripherals on it the router automatcially reconizes it and it is immediately able to connect to the internet, without any more configuration changes to the router.  I love the router's setup screen it is very informative and user friendly.  I just type the router's ip address in IE or netscape and the setup screen comes up.  It even allows you to password protect this setup screen to prevent unauthorized access.In addition to this I am able to share my printer over the network and I just recently got a laptop computer from my employer to use at work and home.  The first time I took the computer home, all I basically had to do was hook up the laptop to the Router make some configuration changes on my laptop (not the router) and voila, my laptop computer was sharing the DSL internet access. It also shares printer and can also access my home computer's hard drives which makes my work alot easier....  I hope they keep up the good work.  I may be upgrading to linksys wireless DSL router in the future, but for now this serves my needs effectively.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good product!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1018915200, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2002"}
