At first I was having all kinds of trouble because my DSL connection uses PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing.  What was happening was after a varying amount of time, my DSL provider (Earthlink) would change the IP address during my session and the router is not able to recognize the change and therefore, it hangs.  You then have to unplug it and reboot your computer.  I have read about other people using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing having the same problems.  It was getting frustrating.  After messing around with this router for several days, I have finally discovered settings that alleviate this problem.  I'm sure many people will find this helpful, and it will save you a lot of aggravation if you are using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing.  First off, you need to flash the latest firmware to the router.  You can download the firmware at the Linksys website  Make sure you have at least Firmware version 1.36 or higher.  In the web configuration utility, enable Connect on demand, and check the Keep Alive box.  Now, here is the most important part!  Set the idle time to: 9999 minutes.  It lets you login to your DSL provider and keep the same IP address for over a week.  Try it out!  Maybe this tip will work as well for you as it did for me!  This router is fantastic and the speed is incredible!  It is the best router you can get for the price in my opinion.  Even if you don't know the first thing of networking, you can figure it out, it really isn't as hard as you imagine it before you purchase it.  Once you have it, it seems to explain itself, and is extremely easy to configure.  A great device to add to your office or home network.  Definately 5 stars!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic!....(once configured properly!!)", "unixReviewTime": 974419200, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2000"}
