I had no problem with the set up and it is a must have for anyone with a DSL or Cable modem connection.  The 4 port 10/100 switch, Firewall, and internet connection sharing capabilities are perfect for the home user who would like to set up a small network or just have internet sharing among PC's.  This works much better than a software sharing solution and is secure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product", "unixReviewTime": 974678400, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2000"}
