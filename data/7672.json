So I thought this would be a breeze.My goal was to free up my proxy server for other  uses.  This seemed to be a good and cheap alternative to a computer.  I  realized that I would be giving up some of the security capabilities of my  proxy server when I did this.I was not using DHCP within the network,  but was being served an IP address to the cable modem via DHCP.  Also, one  of my servers was set up for the default IP address of the router.I  was unable to get the router to recognize the network. I tried setting it  up as a stand alone router and still this didn't work.  I changed the IP  number of one of my servers, tried reinstalling it the router using the  default configuration. Tried resetting it several times.  You name it I  tried it.After a week with no Internet access I decided the benfits did  not outweight the continued hassle.  The benefit of running a proxy server  won.  I reconfigured my Proxy Server which has performed beautifully since.  The proxy has the benefit of being more configurable and provides a better  firewall.I think I could have eventually gotten the Linksys router to  work, but felt it was not worth the extended effort.If you have simple  network and do not need to make configuration changes to either the network  or this router, it would probably install ok.  If you have a more  complicated network, with specific options on how DHCP is being used, and  don't want to run the default router settings, you may run into problems.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Never got it working", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
