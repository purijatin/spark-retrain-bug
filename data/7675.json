Scagliola", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Hello All,I purchased this unit as part of my multi-layer approach to computer security. While there are many other brands that I could have purchased the fact that 99% of routers that my clients are using are Linksys models this alone speaks volumes. The setup of the unit was painless and in less than 5 minutes, I had the unit configured and working flawlessly. I would not hesitate to purchase this unit again nor would I hesitate to recommend it to anyone needing a unit like it.Ciao!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Splitsville", "unixReviewTime": 1116633600, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2005"}
