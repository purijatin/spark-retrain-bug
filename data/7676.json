Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period.  Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "good while it lasts, but doesn't last long", "unixReviewTime": 1081036800, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2004"}
