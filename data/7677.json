Bought it about 3 years ago and so far had no problems at all. Its a breeze to install. Mostly all wired routers work all right. However when I bought this router I had not heard any good reviews about routers other than this one. So decided on this one. Following are the points to consider-May be wireless routers have come out of amateur stage now but still few dropped connections is a common occurence so if you don't need to use it with multiple laptops etc and in multiple locations, go with wired router which is also going to cost you cheap.-For any router, make sure you password protect it as soon as you install it. This is very important as its not difficult to guess the standard password these routers are shipped with. And hackers are always looking to exploit these.cheers!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Its been working non-stop for last 3 years", "unixReviewTime": 1139616000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2006"}
