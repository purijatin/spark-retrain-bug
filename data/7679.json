It only took a couple minutes to replace my 10Mbit hub with this router.  The 10/100 switch in this thing was a  dramatic speed boost from my hub and the NAT (Network Address Translation)  used to share the Internet works flawlessly and is simpler, more flexible  and configurable than Windows 98SE's Internet Connection Sharing.  Not only  do you get the 10/100 switch and NAT, but you get a basic IP firewall which  greatly helps protect your computers from intruders on the Internet.  Regarding the comment from someone wanting two DMZ hosts, you cannot have  two DMZ hosts with one IP address.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great way to share the Internet!", "unixReviewTime": 956707200, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2000"}
