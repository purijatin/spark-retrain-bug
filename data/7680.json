Huber \"Addicted to books!\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Simply put - believe the other reviewers who say this is a snap to put together and make a home network. It's so easy, that unfortunately having a network at home is no longer a geek thing, since anyone can do it. This is the easiest, simplest, and best working router/hub combo I can think of. No more silly winpoet on the computer, no more logging into the DSL account. This router stays connected all the time to the account. All you have to do is turn your computer on to be connected.The most time consuming aspect of setting this up was taking it out of the box, unwrapping everything from the plastic, and fishing behind my desktop to connect the ethernet cables. The actual set up took about five minutes, and was so uncomplicated, I assumed I had done something wrong. But I didn't. Worked perfectly the first time.And this does work as a hub, which I hadn't realized. I used a hub for a while, and then after moving my equipment around, I experimented to see if it work as a hub so I could remove one electrical device. By golly, I could!I highly recommend this gem.The router has a built-in firewall, and works with PCs and Macs. Don't know how it works with linux - haven't tried to connect it to my linux box yet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'd pay twice as much for the ease and wonder of this gem", "unixReviewTime": 1032998400, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2002"}
