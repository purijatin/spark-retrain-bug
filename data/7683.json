George \"DDG\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I purchased Linksys's BEFW11S4 (wireless) router last year and it died on me last month.  I was relieved...because it gave me the opportunity to purchase the new and improved BEFSR41 unit from Circuit City.  This is version 3 of Linksys's now famous networking iron and it cost $... with tax.Setup was very simple: just insert the enclosed CD and follow the instructions.  I was up and running in about forty minutes (encountered some problems with the installed Verizon Online DSL software; I resolved them successfully).  The major difference with this unit is the 10/100Mbps WAN port for a DSL or cable modem; older versions featured a 10-baseT port.  Cisco's name and logo are also displayed on the box and face of the router (they purchased Linksys back in May).Anyone looking for a solid, inexpensive router should look at the Linksys BEFSR41.  It's easy to setup and backed by a company with years of experience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very router good for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1060473600, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2003"}
