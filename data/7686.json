I was unable to configure it from the instructions - which were not Mac-friendly.Linksys Tech Support tried to help, but finally admitted that they didn't have much expertise with Mac OS, and we were unsuccessful in helping me get it to work.I ultimately returned the Linksys router and purchased an Asante Friendlynet FR3004 for about the same price.  It worked the first time, and Asante knows Macs.If you are a Mac user, until Linksys get's more Mac oriented, I'd recommend that you consider another product.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not for Mac's", "unixReviewTime": 973900800, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2000"}
