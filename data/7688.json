As long as a computer stays up and connected, everything seems ok. However, upon computer reboot it may take several tries to obtain a connection from this router. Tried updating the firmware since the firmware was out-of-date but because of bad documentation and a clunky update method the router was temporarily &#34;bricked&#34;. Thank gawd others with the same router posted remedies online (see? The process &#34;bit&#34; other folks too) and after a very painful half-day of work the router was back.
