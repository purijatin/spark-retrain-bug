Ended up having to call tech support to get it working because its default IP address is the same of Verizon's DSL modems.  Tech support took a total of 55 minutes of dealing with multiple people and trying redundant tests to get it resolved.  I've gone through 3 of these in the past 5 years, they don't seem to have a long lifespan.  Still, they're the best of a sorry lot.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "OK product, poor tech support", "unixReviewTime": 1165276800, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2006"}
