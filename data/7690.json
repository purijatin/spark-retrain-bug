The only thing is that when I set up the sling box there was a IP address problem where the router did not have the correct setting but it was quickly solved by reviewing all the places where the router needed to check and match IP addresses.  Moreover, it does \"hide\" your computer from intruders.  However, the downside is that it lasted only one year and I had to get a new router. When it works, it really works, but when it dies, it's dead.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Slingbox Friendly but short life span.", "unixReviewTime": 1227052800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2008"}
