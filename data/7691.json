It has lived up to all of the good reviews and then some.For me it was literally a drop in replacement for a hub.  I unplugged this hub, plugged in the Linksys router and everything worked.  It doesn't get easier than that.Of course, most people are going to want to configure the router a bit.  No problem, the web interface makes it simple.  Just open up your browser and point it at the router's IP address.  You are presented with a set of web pages that allow you to configure all of the router's settings.  If you need to run a server or two it takes no time to open ports through the web interface.On the downside, there are some inconsistencies between the router's documentation and the Linksys website documentation.  For example, one set of documentation says that DHCP must be disabled if you are going to use port forwarding.  Another says the opposite.  As it turns out, DHCP works fine with port forwarding.Overall, this router is a great addition to your home network.  It will allow you to share a single broadband connection without purchasing additional IP addresses and provide enhanced security through its firewall features.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Incredibly easy to set up and maintain", "unixReviewTime": 1017014400, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2002"}
