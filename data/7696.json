It took me 2 hours to set up - let the software set this thing up for you, don't use the \"quick\" set up directions any farther than hooking the cables up in the right spots. I had to reset this thing like 4 times before I got it to start. I hope that if I have any more problems they'll arise within a month so Amazon can take this back. For now, it's good. I'm just using this as a firewall for now. If I hook it up to another computer I'll let you know whether it works! If you're shopping still, the reviews are definitely better for the Netgear stuff, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed because this was a cheap way for me to get a firewall.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Little Difficulty Setting Up But OK for Now", "unixReviewTime": 1087862400, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2004"}
