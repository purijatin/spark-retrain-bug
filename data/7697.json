It has been running continuous since it arrived.  I have never had any problem with it, even with peer-to-peer clients running nearly continuous on two computers.  It is also very fast.  I just bought a wireless access point last month and plugged it into this router and am now slamming another two computers through it (five total) and it's all drama-free with this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Purchased on February 16, 2003", "unixReviewTime": 1196467200, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2007"}
