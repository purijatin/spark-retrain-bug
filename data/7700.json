We use the big-boy products like Cisco PIX firewalls at a cost of $15000 per network segement we are protecting. The level of protection and functionality you get out of this device is amazing at the price. I have also used the comparable NetGear router and found it to be pretty much equivalent. I have also built similar firewalls using Linux and an old PC - a process that usually takes a day or two of your free time (if you know what you're doing). The $... or so that these devices cost is cheap for two days of my personal time.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you have a CableModem or DSL, get this!", "unixReviewTime": 994204800, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2001"}
