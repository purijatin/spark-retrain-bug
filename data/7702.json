Smooth/ transparent operation and a very reasonable price.  When I purchased it, the single port was not yet available, or I might have  opted to go that route since I am using it primarily for the firewall. The  single port is also a good option for folks who are considering going to a  wireless network- but, I have absolutely no complaints with this choice  &amp; for folks who are interested in setting up a network this is a very  good choice.  The literature says it can support more than 500 simultaneous  users- well beyond the needs of most home or small offices users.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy set up, smooth operation", "unixReviewTime": 961200000, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2000"}
