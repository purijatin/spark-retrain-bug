Tapanes", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I've been putting off hooking up a router to get my son and wife's PC on the internet because I dreaded having to slog through getting information from my ISP (Verizon), configuring network cards and generally mucking around in places I wasn't comfortable mucking around in.Well, there was absolutely no reason to wait at all.  From plunking the unopened box onto my desk to surfing the internet through the new router took about 10 minutes (and there was a bathroom break included in that time)!  Super easy to setup on my existing PC and absolutely painless on my wife's new PC (running XP all I had to do was plug the network cable in and it did the rest).I must've [made a mistake] ... setting up my DSL originally on my WinME computer, but after installing this router, my internet connection is MUCH faster.  I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to do this!!Great product, highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I LOVE stuff that installs super easy and works great!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1008633600, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2001"}
