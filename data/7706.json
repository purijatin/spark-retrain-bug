A few port scans aren't bad, but when my firewall was constantly going berzerk with alerts and warnings, I decided I'd had enough.The router comes with a built-in simple firewall that blocks most of the simple scans, however be sure to place a LARGE password into the router login screen.  Secondly, you get a built-in PPPOE handler which frees up needing that utility installed on every OS you boot (BSD presented a problem for me).Installing my unit took about 5 minutes, after the ritualistic tossing aside of the manual, I simply plugged it up, hooked in my computers and rebooted the OS's.  That built-in DHCP helps quite a bit but my only gripe after some years of use is you only get ONE DMZ IP.Over the past 2 years, Linksys has had some very minor problems that they've patched quickly and allowed me to download/flash the hardware without any difficulty, along with some nice feature additions.  Flashing this unit couldn't be easier, especially with Linksys' web-based interface.Overall, I've not had any issues with my Linksys router and would purchase another one immediately if mine died - especially since Amazon has lowered the price significantly since I first purchased it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible router", "unixReviewTime": 1036540800, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2002"}
