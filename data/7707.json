You don't need the accompanying CD-ROM to set it up.  In my case, I hooked it up to a Toshiba cable modem and followed the quick start guide to configure the settings.  It didn't work right away.  A quick call to my cable modem provider revealed that I needed to turn the cable modem off and back on so it can &quot;tolerate&quot; the router.So when you set this up for the first time, be sure to restart both the router and the cable modem after you configure it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good product, manual could be better", "unixReviewTime": 1034726400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2002"}
