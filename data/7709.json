There are two products that I have that really impressed me....1. TIVO 2. Linksys router/switchWhat it takes for me to actually be impressed by a technology product it has to be simple, (plug and play simple) the right price or better and be 99.999% reliable or better.This product is simple, just plug the darn thing in and it works. You only need to configure it if you want to do something a little non-standard.It has yet to fail me and I have had it for quite some time.If you need to share a high speed internet connection like DSL or cable this product is the best I have seen. Also in it;'s latest incarnation it supports PPPoE so it will work with any DSL provider out there without having to install the crummy ISP software on your actual workstation.Oh yeah and don't forget it supports NAT (Network Address Translation) so it basically acts as a firewall as well.One of the benefits of this system is that if you use DSL you will no longer need the anoying PPPoE software installed on your system since this device will do it for you.With Verizon I had to install the software as part of the account setup but once it gave me my user name and password I then put that into the Linksys and uninstalled the PPPoE software from my system. It now is truly online at all time since I have told the Linksys to keep the connection alive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super easy to use and no garbage software on your system", "unixReviewTime": 982022400, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2001"}
