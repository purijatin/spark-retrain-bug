Its installation had been complicated and very time-consuming.  I was not looking forward to replacing it. My good experience with LinkSys products, including my cable modem, led me to this choice. In addition, it was available at a good price and had the necessary capacity for my home office setup. I plugged it in, powered up, and everything performed flawlessly. I didn't even have to install drivers or any software. It has continued to work without incident. I am a very happy camper. Thanks, LinkSys!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Network--No Sweat", "unixReviewTime": 1125360000, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2005"}
