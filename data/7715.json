Extensive hardware firewall options for the power user who is looking for a wired router.  I have to say though that my first router gave up its electronic life after about 5 years.  Even though I am electronically versed I was unable to troubleshoot or repair it.  Thus I bought another one of this type, and it is still going strong.  Keep in mind that the firmware is upgradable, i.e. if you don't mind working with .bin files and flashing EEPROMs through the router's internal setup page you can keep it updated very easily.  I used these boxes under Win95, WinXP, Win7, and never had any problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid 4-port router", "unixReviewTime": 1355097600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012"}
