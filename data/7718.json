I had heard about cable routers, but I was skeptical that it could be as \"plug and play\" as they say they are. Well, 'they' were right.This was EASY as CAKE. I connected the cable modem to the router, ran an ethernet wire to each computer from the router, and I was all set. All I had to do was enable something to do with my ethernet card in my control panel. SO EASY. The directions are very clear and easy to follow.If your looking to spread out that cable connection, a router from lynksys is the way to go. It's cheap it's easy, go for it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy as CAKE", "unixReviewTime": 1039219200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2002"}
