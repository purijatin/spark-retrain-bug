I now have all my computers connected to my DSL connection.  I no longer have to disconnect one cable to install it into a different computer for Internet access.  It was easy to wire my computers to this router.  I have not noticed any decrease in speed on my Internet connection.The problem was setting up the router's firmware.  My best guess is that Linksys expects you to connect this router to a cable company modem instead of a DSL modem.  In order to connect to a DSL modem, you must change the router's address from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1.  Be sure your DSL modem is not connected to the router when you do this.I could not find this information on the CD that came with the router.  I had to go to the Linksys website for this information.Overall, I do recommend this router.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Router - Poor Documentation", "unixReviewTime": 1242259200, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2009"}
