However, I didn't think I had any choice, because Earthlink uses PPPoE (Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet), and the early home routers didn't support that.The Linksys BEFSR41 does support it, and does it transparently.  Now I don't need to use Earthlink's WinPoEt to log in, the router does it for me.  I just turn either computer on, and I've got internet access.I found setup to be a breeze.  I connected the router, pulled up with Router's webpage style controls using Internet Explorer, told it I was using PPPoE, my earthlink user name and password, and I was done.  That, and I had to undo all the proxy settings I set up for WinProxy, but if you aren't using a software solution right now, that's not something you'll need to worry about.Incidently, the router also functions as a network hub.  If you have 4 or fewer computers, you don't need a separate hub.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent, simple solution to DSL sharing", "unixReviewTime": 1019433600, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2002"}
