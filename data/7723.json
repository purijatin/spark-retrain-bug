I have been using this on my home network for over 2 months now and it has been absolutely stable and my connection speed is much better than the router I used before. I rated customer support 4 stars but to be honest I haven't had to use it at all. Setup was as simple as connecting my computers, cable modem and powering it up. Very pleased with this router.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast and Reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1287792000, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2010"}
