Bluing", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I purchased the Linksys router several months ago and I have never been more satisfied with a piece of electronic equipment.  I had 3 PC's in my home and I wanted them all to share the same Cable Modem access.  The installation was a piece of cake and I was up and running in about 10 mins. I have two long CAT5 cable runs in my home, one is approx. 40 ft the other is approx. 25ft the router runs them all no problem. I highly recommend this router to anyone looking to network multiple computers in their home or small business.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outsanding Value, Error Free Operation", "unixReviewTime": 1035676800, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2002"}
