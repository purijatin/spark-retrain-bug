It takes care of PPPoe, connecting and authenticating as it needs, so your system is under the impression that you're connected directly to the network (through a proxy, of course). Which is great, because I always hated dialing up - even if only takes seconds. Plus, it puts you behind the linksys firewall, making you virtually impervious to any attack (no more cpu-cycle eating firewall applications).Now add to that the fact that you can split your network to 4 to 253 (via hubs) ports, and you get an excellent product, at a very modest price. It requires no computer software - often your computer doesn't even know it's there - and has an easily flashable BIOS. In minutes, I managed to connect 3 machines, effortlessly.The router comes with a throng of options, and allows you to dialup on demand (to your pppoe provider), or send constant keepalive signals, to keep you from being disconnected. Probably the best seventy-something bucks I ever spent.One last issue: the router constantly emits a mild hum - about as loud as a quiet computer fan. Noticeable, but nothing very significant - just don't keep the router near your pillow :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "riddance from PPPoE!", "unixReviewTime": 1015804800, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2002"}
