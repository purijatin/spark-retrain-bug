Before I start, a word of warning - I use the product with RoadRunner in Columbus, Ohio; we are a pure DHCP with no login style of cable system; your  &quot;mileage&quot; may vary depending or your ISP.I had this unit setup  and working in 5 minutes. 1 - Turn off the cable modem and your PC. 2 -  Install the DSL router. (Use good quality NON-crossover cables.) 3 - Turn  on the cable modem. 4 - Turn on the DSL router. 5 - Turn on the PC. You are  done. For most people, this is all that is needed.Open your browser and  point it to 192.168.1.1 and check the release level of the software. Then,  check LinkSys and verify you have the latest version. A couple of the early  releases had a few &quot;gotchas&quot;.I have used this router with a  combination of machines running NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 2000  (Professional and Advanced Server), and Red Hat Linux with no problem  (There shouldn't have been since this is a standard DCHP server and NAT  box.)I just finished a 60Mb down load with no problem.Some people may  need more functionality than this box delivers (advanced filtering, etc.)  This is NOT a $2000 Cisco router and it doesn't try to be. Check you needs  and if you are a typical SOHO user; this unit will most likely fill the  bill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible value", "unixReviewTime": 958953600, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2000"}
