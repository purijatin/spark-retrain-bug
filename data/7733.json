Installation was a snap, and I've had zero trouble getting multiple PCs on the Internet at the same time.  The switched hub manages local traffic efficiently, and supports Ethernet and Fast Ethernet clients concurrently with no problems.One word of advice.  If you plan to add more than four PCs to your intranet, just get the one-port DSL router and use a separate switched hub.  That way, all your connections are handled by the switch, instead of split between the router and the switch.  There are no problems doing it either way, you just may save some money buying a one-port router, plus your switch may manage traffic better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Product!", "unixReviewTime": 1014681600, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2002"}
