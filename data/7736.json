This router will crash frequently if you are doing that and you will have to reset it -- no if's, and's, or but's. It will generally crash if data transfers get very busy, which is frustrating.However, this router has an impressive list of features like forwarding that allow you to do things like:- Setup WWW server. - Setup FTP server. - Setup remote control software.Combined with dynamic DNS services, you can host a fairly decent site on the web from your home.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great but problematic for more advanced users", "unixReviewTime": 979603200, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2001"}
