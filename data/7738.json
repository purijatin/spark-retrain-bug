It's my job to put together global networks, using the arcane syntax of Cisco's IOS, or Extreme's CLI.So when I built my home network to support my 3 PCs, work laptop, and my two roomates PCs and Macs, I was looking for a product that was versatile, durable, and reliable.  The LinkSys BEFSR41 is all that and more.Set up is a snap.  The web tools are fantastic, the guide is extremely well put together.  Even flashing the BIOS -- a relatively uncommon, esoteric task by anyone's standards -- had a well thought out, easy to use tool.I've now had this product running for about a year and a half, sitting under my roomate's printer table.  It's totally maintenance and headache free.  I've used it to telecommute, host a web site, and just plain fool around.I would recommend this as highly to the most descriminating engineer as to the average home user.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellence through simplicity", "unixReviewTime": 1010275200, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2002"}
