Gustin", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I was given this router as a gift, personally, I had been looking at Netgear Routers, however, now having used this Linksys router for about 4 months, I am recommending them to everyone.  For starters, (and this REALLY impressed me because I was planning on spending the AFTERNOON getting it working) I got this up and running within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box.  There's hardly ANY configuration to do and once it's up, it's up.  There are lots of Advanced settings that can be tweaked and in the instance where I needed to do some Port Forwarding to my internal PC's IP Address, it was easy to accomplish using the built in Web-Browser based Configuration Utility.  Transferring files internally at 100Mbs is just awesome.  I like the design with the &quot;stackable&quot; feature - I've already filled my 4 ports!  Now I am considering getting the Wireless version of this same router and when I do, I'll simply link them both together via the Uplink ports and then stack the new one on top.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to connect multiple computers together to share files/internet access.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellect Performance, Excellect Product", "unixReviewTime": 1024358400, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2002"}
