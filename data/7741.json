I wanted both to be able to share our broadband Internet service.  I looked at several routers, both wired and wireless.  It came down to the Linksys (wired version) and SMC Barricade Wireless.  I kept coming back to Linksys because a friend owns one and raves about it.Besides the fact that it looks really cool, it almost took me longer to get it out of the box than it did to set it up.  No kidding!  Using the QuickStart guide, I was up and running in less than ten minutes.  You hook up the necessary cables, restart your computer, log-in to the Linksys website to configure your router, restart your computer again, and you're good to go.I wasn't as optimistic about setting up my Power Mac G3. However, I was pleasantly surprised and it took me all of about five minutes before I was doing some high-speed surfing on that machine as well.  Fortunately, my Mac has an Ethernet port so it was just a matter of attaching the CAT-5 cable from there to the Linksys and setting the TCP/IP control panel to the Ethernet and DHCP options.  I saved my configuration, opened up my browser and spent the next two hours high-speed surfing with no problems.I have no problem recommending the Linksys, especially for its ease of setup on a PC and Mac network.  While I would have preferred a wireless setup, they've received mixed reviews and I was concerned about Mac compatibility.  After seeing how well my Mac performs with this Linksys, I'm ready to make ours a wired household!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My PC and my Mac now share high-speed Internet access!", "unixReviewTime": 999561600, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2001"}
