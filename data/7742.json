Johnson \"zerothis\"", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "Before I get started I feel the need to say, the lack of a CAT 5 cable not being included is not a con.  Linksys has no idea how far it is from my computers to my cable modem and the last thing I need is another useless cable (because it's to short or way to long, or a patch cable instead of a crossover cable) to wrap up and pack away in that box with the rest of them.I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of setup.  I had taken the phone of the hook and cleared my schedule in preparation for installing this thing called a &quot;router&quot; so both my PCs could access the Internet and be networked to each other all at the same time.  About 3 minutes later both my PCs were still networked to each other and downloading from the Internet.  The router was doing it's job invisibly.  The configuration of the router is handled by typing a URL (specified in the installation instructions) into any web browser then filling in a few blanks on the page that loads with a few more numbers.  The instructions show where to find these numbers in the windows control panel.  So psyched was I, that I immediately rebooted my main computer to Linux and tackled installing it there.  Same URL, same page, same numbers, same great results.  For a few seconds I even deluded myself about how user friendly Linux is (to bad Linksys doesn't distribute Linux :)  Since I found myself with free time I read instructions that explained clearly how to do a bunch of things I'll probably never do (but I'm sure some people do) and a few things I will.  Things such as Netmeeting, DHCP server, NAT, PPPoE and even multi player games like Age of Empires and Unreal are succinctly explained in relation to the router and the router's configuration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy setup, works great.", "unixReviewTime": 971827200, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2000"}
