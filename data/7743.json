Either people love it because it was a breeze to get it up and running or people hated it because it simply didnt work. Reading all the reviews i found that there were more satisfied buyers then unsatisfied ones. I was also convinced by many of my firends who have said that linksys products have excellent support and that this particular router was the best around.Unfortunately when i first set up this router it wouldnt connect to my ISP. Afer about an hour of fruitless attempts, i gave up. Since our DSL modem had multiple ports, All of my home PC's could access the internet however not simultaneously. So for about 3 months the router sat quitely on my desk collecting dust. Then one day after a friend suggested to update the firmware of the router i decided to give it another shot. In between that time i refreshed my system and did a complete install of XP. Whether it was a function of the new firmware for the router i downloaded from linksys or windows XP i had the router up and running in minutes. I have two XP systems and one 98se system on our home LAN and they all share the internet seamlessly. Even Gaming was noticably faster.I highly recommend this router. Its easy to set up and linksys is known for great support. You really can't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "As good as advertised.", "unixReviewTime": 1021075200, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2002"}
