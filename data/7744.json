O'Brien \"Jim O.\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I'm running a Dell box with Windows 98 and a Gateway with Windows 95.I did quite a bit of research on different units and even considered the D-Link, etc.  But upon my limited knowledge of the Linksys rep. and a friend's input, I purchased the BEFSR41.I brought it home and installed everything.  I had it configured and up in running in a matter of minutes on my Windows 98 box.  It's super easy and user friendly to install and set-up.  It also kept my network up and going as well.  And..  It seems plenty secure.If you're looking for a great entry level router, this would be the one I'd recommend for the home user and maybe evne the small business user.  You really do not need to know a lot about networks to utilize it.The only real complaints I have is that I have to click the \"Connect\" button twice on the Status > Router screen when I'm connecting to the Internet; and even though it seems I can usually connect to my network, both machines do not appear/display in my Network Neighborhood all the time.  But in fairness this could just be some issue between the 2 machines.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Linksys does great for the home", "unixReviewTime": 1117238400, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2005"}
