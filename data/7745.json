I connected my Ethernet DSL Modem from PacBell to the router, then connected my computers to the router using CAT 5 Cable (not included). 2. I flashed the firmware to the latest version from Linksys (make sure you do this). 3. Using the web-based interface I entered my PPPOE log-in name and password and then walla. All my computers were connected. If you follow instructions for this router, it really is a piece of cake.  Easier than installing my scanner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy as Plug-and-Play", "unixReviewTime": 998870400, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2001"}
