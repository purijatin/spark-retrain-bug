The [item price] seemed worth giving it a shot and I'm in love.Literally plug and play.  The only thing I had to do was call my ISP to re-issue my IP address (my ISP only issues 1, and it's specific to a single network device).  After that - anything I plug in works (and I've done a lot in the past week) - borrowing wifi cards, other types of network cards.Don't wait - if you've got broadband coming to your house and more than one computer - this router's for you!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Truly Plug and Play", "unixReviewTime": 1019952000, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2002"}
