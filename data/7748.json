Green \"John Green\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This little router was the answer to our need to add a DSL connection to an additional Linux box in a student's room in our home. 25' of network cable, an in-obtrusive heating-register-level hole in a shared wall and setting the ip addresses for the Linux networking and we were up and running. On the WinVista box Win took over before we had a chance to set ip addresses, so we needed to go into network and re-set those, else the router was seen as just being a thoughput device.I was surprised at the ease of installation, and the Linksys support person (wherever he may have been) was clear and helpful. I like having a wired network rather than wireless because it seems more secure, and, well, because it's cheap!Now if I can just get my son to help me configure the Linux box to drive the WinVista box's printer.All-in-all, if you are thinking of networking 1 to 4 boxes and don't mind running some cables, this Linksys will fit your bill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good little home router!", "unixReviewTime": 1188518400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2007"}
