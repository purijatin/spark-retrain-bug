Bryan", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "At the same time I bought the Linksys Cable Modem, I bought this router/switch to allow all the machines on my in-house network to access the Internet.  It replaced my previous hub without a glitch, and smoothly connected to the cable modem.  Everything works perfectly!  An added feature I wasn't aware of, but which turned out to be helpful, was the ability to filter a particular MAC address to prevent access to the Internet.  Quite handy, that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works as advertised", "unixReviewTime": 1043020800, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2003"}
