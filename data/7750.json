It acts as a network switch (better than a hub), a broadband (high-speed network) router and a firewall. Although Linksys offers no Mac-specific support, it works with Macs, even with an AirPort hooked into it.Linksys has released several firmware upgrades, which can be easily uploaded to the BEFSR41. A TFTP program is included in the firmware update package, but it's only for PCs (no surprise there, based on my previous comment.)Mac users will need to download MacTFTP, a shareware implementation of a TFTP client. Search on versiontracker.com for the latest version.Macs and PCs can share the same internet connection.The BEFSR41 also acts as a DHCP server, so you don't need to pre-assign IP addresses to the Macs and PCs in your network.The firewall prevents others on the Internet from snooping into your network; an important consideration if you have a high-speed Internet connection that is constantly online.Changing the settings is easy and can be accomplished through a web browser on either a PC or Mac. Simply use the IP address of the router as the url. ...It will prompt you for a userid and password. Leave the userid blank and enter just the password. (If you haven't changed the password yourself, the original password can be found by reading the owner's manual.)Unless you have some very specific network requirements, the out-of-the-box configuration will work very well for most people.Make sure you write down any settings you change. When you upgrade the firmware, all settings are reset to factory defaults.The best features: extremely easy to set up and it works.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Pleasant Surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1021939200, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2002"}
