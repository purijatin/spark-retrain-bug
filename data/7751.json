Because the campus network is a bit of a hacker haven, my systems  used to detect about 3 to 5 hacker probes/scans a week.  The probes no  longer reaches my machines.Another benefit: I can now confidently use  Windows file-sharing in my personal network, and leave it turned on all the  time.  No more worrying about people snooping my data, or storing their  files on my server.And another: Someone once printed test pages to my  printer (attached to a NetGear Print Server), probably thinking my print  server was his.  That problem won't happen ever again!You could set up  an old PC as your firewall; but then you'd have to load and configure the  operating system and firewalling software, and you'd have a bulky/noisy PC  running all the time.  This router sits quietly behind my desk, takes up  little space (about the size of a VHS tape), and consumes very little  power.  Trust me, it's worth the price.Think of this router like a solid  door to your house: It is solid, is mostly unobtrusive, is easy to use, and  keeps strangers from peering in and wandering in unannounced.  I can't  imagine a home without a door; and I can't imagine a network without a  firewall of some kind.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "BEFSR41 works great.
