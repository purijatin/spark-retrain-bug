Like most Linksys products, the documentation is poor, but setup is painless.  Configuration is done over a web interface and is reasonably simple.Since it has a DHCP server, it makes setting up Windows and Linux machines painless.  The DMZ feature allows you to expose a computer to the internet, which is good if you want to setup a game server.  Additionally, it supports selective port forwarding if you want to setup your own ftp, mail, or web server(s).In over a year I haven't had any trouble with it.  Recommended.NOTE: UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE.  There are several known security flaws in the previous versions of the firmware.  The most notable will allow an attacker to use the firewall to launch a DoS attack against a remote host.  Flashing the firmware is easy; the software is available on the Linksys website.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little firewall/router/hub", "unixReviewTime": 1066089600, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2003"}
