Out of the box it worked perfectly with four different computers in my house, two with Windows Me, one with Windows 2000, and another with Windows NT 4.0.  I have never had such a carefree installation of a single piece of computer hardware.  You can also plug your present network hub into it and keep adding more to it as you go along, so it is almost infinitely expandable.  It sets it up so you only have to buy and pay for one cable modem connection, a considerable savings for me with Road Runner charging ten dollars more for each computer connected up to the system.  The cable guy who installed my cable system and modem chatted with me honestly and said all of the guys in his shop say that this is the best unit for this type of set up you can buy, and I believe them all.  He said, \"We are supposed to tell customers that this thing won't work so they buy more connections, but I don't owe the company anything.\"  If you have not surfed with a fast connection like cable you do not yet understand what the Net is and need to find out.  It will change your perspective on everything.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "JWJewell", "unixReviewTime": 978566400, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2001"}
