Coleman", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "I used to be a big linksys lover, but my experience with several of their products (both here and at work, where I'm the IT guy) makes me seriously think that their quality is suspect.My experience at home is with the BEFSR41.As far as featureset and stability, it's great!  No problems and the functionality is excellent.  I'm very happy in that regards (which is why I gave this a 3 instead of a 1).As far as quality goes, though, I have a different experience.I leave these on 24 hrs a day and have several computers hooked up to it.My first one died, unexpectedly, after 13 months.  They wouldn't replace it (out of warranty), but my credit card company did reimburse me (the credit card extended warranties DO work!)  So, I went an bought another one.  6 months later, it started freezing up and required an unplug/replug.  It started happening more and more.  So, I saw that there was a firmware upgrade... I upgraded and it died.So, it's under warranty and they offer a great exchange policy (I know, because I had to use it with their wireless router at work -- it too just died one day), so I will exchange it for another one.BUT... after seeing 4 of their products die unexpectedly (I also purchased their VPN router at work and it stopped working after around 18 months), I can honestly say that I am no longer on the Linksys bandwagon (hence my foray into Netgear).So... my opinion is that this is a great product... until it dies.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Had two - great functionality, but both died", "unixReviewTime": 1099180800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2004"}
