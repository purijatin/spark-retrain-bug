(Contrary to at least one review of this product, this router DOES work with Macintosh.)I purchased it and hooked it up without incident in less than 15 minutes to a second PC, made the required connection via Internet Explorer to Linksys' server and entered the required values. (The instructions are easy to follow and adequately illustrated.)After restarting both computers, I anticipated continued success.  Unfortunately, my computers could not establish a link with my provider. Since I had previous success (prior to purchasing) with their Tech Support, I called and was efficiently walked through some additional tweeking via Internet Explorer to the Linksys server. I was up and running with a minimal amount of hassle. One STAR taken away for not working immediately out of the box.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I'd Buy Another", "unixReviewTime": 1026864000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2002"}
