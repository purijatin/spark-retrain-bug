I had bought a Netgear RP614NA.  The Netgear unit was impossible for this technically naive user to install, the instructions were confusing, and the service center was outsourced.  AND after all the hassle, the Netgear unit was not Xbox Live compatible.  With the Linksys unit, the help line is on the West Coast, it is virtually plug-and-play, and Xbox Live and my computer live happily side-by-side on the network.  Only 5 minutes from box to surfing Live.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super easy to install", "unixReviewTime": 1162944000, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2006"}
