Was hesitant about this unit serving my needs because cable company wanted almost $200.00 to install and setup their version of home networking (for older Mac with processor upgrade and G4 PowerBook). PC stores offered little help. Manager at local Radio Shack handed me the box containing the BEFSR41 and told me to disregard all PC instructions. \"You'll know what to do. You have a 100% money back guarantee.\" Using built-in Ethernet, it took just minutes to have both machines online. Running Mac OS 9.1, Classic, 9.2.2 and 10.3.7. No problem. Always on.I'll be replacing the RCA modem supplied by the cable company with a Linksys BEFCMU10. They stack nicely.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No problem with Macs", "unixReviewTime": 1112486400, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2005"}
