I had to powerdown then power back up the router, then it would work again for a while.I called Linksys tech support  and after finally getting through, I was told to reinstall Windows 2000 and that would solve the problem.I took another tack and bought a NetGear RT314.  The NetGear isn't nearly as pretty, and anything beyond simple setup requires you to Telnet into the router (instead of using a Web interface), but....but....but....it has run and run and run and run and I've never had to touch it.  I've never had to power it down once.IT JUST WORKS!So, avoid the Linksys and get a NetGear", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Frequent power-offs required", "unixReviewTime": 984873600, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2001"}
