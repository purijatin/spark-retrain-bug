I already had holes in the walls for a network connection with a crossover cable and had network cards installed, so I didn't need a wireless router and receivers. I decided on getting this one due to being familiar with the company's cable modem.Setting up the computers with the router was simple with the help of the CD installation program. The router automatically treated the crossover cable as a regular ethernet cable which saved me another trip to the store. Updating the firmware was also easy to do and no problems came out of that.A few weeks later, the Linksys router kept resetting itself every 15 minutes every time I had torrent connections going. Through some online searching, I found out that my DSL modem had a built-in router as well and there was some conflict with the Linksys router. After switching off most of the auto-detect options and manually entering in most of the connection settings on both the DSL modem and Linksys router, the router was rock-solid again.As long as the firmware is up to date and there are no conflicts between the modem and router, it should work without problems.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy to set up, takes a bit of effort to keep it solid", "unixReviewTime": 1180828800, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2007"}
