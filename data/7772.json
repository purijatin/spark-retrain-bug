If you're getting a Linksys router, you may want to consider doing what I did. Noting the frailty of the unit, I bought the three year warranty, where the store will replace the unit if it breaks, no questions asked. Even with the extra warranty, the unit was inexpensive, and if it breaks, the store probably has more clout with Linksys than I do. The four star rating is due to the unit's easy setup.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Thoughts on reliability", "unixReviewTime": 1035158400, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2002"}
