Unfortunately, this is not the case.  This device will either operate as a poor interface with the internet or will allow limited operation between connnected devices, but  NOT BOTH.  After spending many hours (6) with their Phillipines based support group, it has been determined that this is the way it works.  I would suggest that anybody who purchases this device to do so at their own risk.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not a good product", "unixReviewTime": 1041206400, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2002"}
