But I got this router installed so quick to my exisiting desktop PC and to my new laptop, that arrived last night, that I thought I had missed something.  The set-up CD-ROM worked flawlessly.I'm baffled by the negative comments I read regarding this router and other Linksys products.  I have no complaints.Remember a couple of things before you start installation:You'll need extra Cat 5 ethernet cables, you'll probably just need a short one to connect the modem to the router and longer ones from the router to your PCs;Have your work order handy from your original cable internet installation, it'll have important info that you may need if the set-up disk can't detect your particular computer info, like IP address and domain/gateway name, if you still need the IP address, go to the command prompt from the accessories menu in Win XP and type in 'ipconfig' and it'll give the info you need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Installation was as smooth as silk", "unixReviewTime": 1034812800, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2002"}
