There are many, many options which you have no access to through the installation CD. There is a web interface for setting options, but the address is nowhere to be found in the documentation. You have to hunt through the Linksys web site to find it. Then go through tons of Linksys FAQs to find information for the different settings and what to do if things go wrong.After hours and hours of investigation and setting different options and going through technical support, my internet connection was still slow and constantly breaking off. Definitely not a good product.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Bad News", "unixReviewTime": 1168387200, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2007"}
