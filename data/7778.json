It prevents anyone from the outside getting into your computers.2. It's a Network Address  Translator. It allows you to connect 4 different computers to one Internet  connection- and this can be expanded up to 253 computers, with the addition  of inexpensive hubs.3. It's a 100baseT switch. This means it allows all  the computers you connect to it to communicate with each other at speeds of  100 million bits per second- that's nearly two million times faster than a  56KB modem!And it's very easy to set up- I had my home network running  in a half hour. All you need to use it is a network card in your computer-  something most computers come with these days- and enough ethernet cables  to connect all your home computers to it.Like a lot of people these  days, when I remodeled my house I ran two pieces of Category 5 wire to  every phone outlet; now I can plug a computer into any room of the house,  and it's on the internet.If you've got more than one computer in the  house, and a high speed connection, you need this box. Even for just one  computer, the firewall features alone are worth the money to make your  system completely hack proof.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You NEED this box!", "unixReviewTime": 956966400, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2000"}
