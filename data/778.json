After finding out that non-rechargeable batteries only lasted 2-3 weeks, the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell won't do much for a non-rechargeable battery.  I bought this product, and am very happy with it. My weather station is happy again, the charger itself (which I've only used for the initial charge) worked quickly and without a hitch.  The product design is pleasant and fool proof.  I'm a satisfied customer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the Job Without Fuss or Muss", "unixReviewTime": 1279324800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2010"}
