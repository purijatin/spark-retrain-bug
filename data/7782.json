McEachen", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewtext": "I read reviews (but not on usenet) about how great this router was - but when I started using it with my linux and windows 98SE boxes attached to an @home cable modem, I noticed that EVERY ftp download and every other image  had checksum errors. Very odd - in my 20 years of BBS/Cerfnet/Internet  experience, I had NEVER seen CRC corruption issues.The user experience  was that ftp was COMPLETELY broken, and that every fifth image on a webpage  would look like noise.Linksys has a firmware upgrade - and even after  applying the thing, I still have connection refused issues and corrupt  downloads that mysteriously go away when I take the router out of the  picture. Terrible.I returned mine and got a NetGear router. Make sure  you do some usenet research - or be prepared to take it back - this seems  to be a common problem with this router - it even refers to the corruption  problems in the &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; that came with the  thing. It tells you to use a different ftp client - hah! - as if that would  fix their hardware issue! Oh well. Viva la competition.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Corruption even after the firmware upgrade", "unixReviewTime": 962755200, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2000"}
