I have a Linux box on my LAN which I was planning to forward FTP, Telnet, etc. requests to. The user manual suggests DHCP should be turned off for this to fly.Not true.In the router  configuration, specify the starting DHCP IP address as 100. I then  configured my Linux box to a static address of 192.168.1.2 and forwarded  accordingly via the router's Forwarding tab within the Advanced  configuration.Everything flew as advertised.Finally, be sure to  specify &quot;Client for Microsoft Networks&quot; as the default Primary  Network Login and be sure to give your ISP the &quot;WAN ADDRESS&quot; of  the router if needed. (my cable modem ISP only hands out a dynamic IP  addresses to a specified MAC address - 5 minute phone call to change  it)CuratorBTW, the LinkSys tech support number is 800.326.7114 and is  as 24-hour shop. Unfortunately I was picked up by an operator that took  down my name and number to be called back &quot;due to heavy call  loads&quot;. The turnaround time was about an hour and the staff was XLNT  once I finally got them on the horn.Definitely 5 Stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rox", "unixReviewTime": 959904000, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2000"}
