The product offers many of the same features as Belkin or D-Link in regards to DHCP, PPPOE etc.  The beauty is that if these acronyms mean nothing to you, no problem.  The router has a overall good manual with a browser interface that makes setup and configuration easy.  The manual uses many screenshots that help when looking for the appropriate setting and offer some explanation to the features. All of the basic features are set to work with almost any cable/dsl setup and if you need more configuration the options are usually there.The only problem I have found is that the firmware updates are needed for better control and functionality, but the java based website can be problematic.  They require you modify you security settings for Java in IE, which can be daunting for some and also do not always work.  I was able to manually install, but the browser interface would be easier for the novice.  Other than that, this is a good router on par with the majority of other big name home routers on the market.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product for the home network", "unixReviewTime": 1036972800, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2002"}
