After some setup screwups we all got our linkys working perfectly with our cable modems.  Since then our linkys have been real work horses.  I love the linky hardware firewall protection.  The only time I need to drop protection and go into the linky dmz zone is for MS Netmeeting.  You will not go wrong buying this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A real work horse", "unixReviewTime": 1020729600, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2002"}
