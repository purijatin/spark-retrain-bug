Then I started noticing that things just stopped working.  None of my computers could get to the Internet.  So, I hit the \"Reset\" button on the router and everything appeared to be working again..until the next day.To make a long story short, it seemed like everyday I had to hit the \"Reset\" button and the router eventually stopped working altogether.  Frustrated, I bought the equivalent router from Netgear and have never had a problem since.Hope this helps you avoid my mistakes.  Do yourself a favor and go with NetGear right off the bat.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Buy This If You Like Hitting the Reset Button", "unixReviewTime": 1044748800, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2003"}
