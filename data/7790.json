Easy to set up, took 15 minutes!  If a friend comes over with his computer,  easy to plug them in on the network to share the connection or just swap  some files.  And the firewall is great for protecting my computer from the  rest of the net!  I love this cable router and HIGHLY recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "what a great product", "unixReviewTime": 965952000, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2000"}
