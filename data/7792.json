Don't know if the upgrade had an effect, but the router  never worked well after that.  I spent about 8 hours with Linksys and they wound up blaming AT&T.  Spent more hours with AT&T who were quick to blame Linksys. Dead end here and no guarantee.  I wound up buying an AT&T modem/router which installed easily and works fine so far. Beware using this router if you have AT&T DSL.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not compatible with AT&T DSL", "unixReviewTime": 1258761600, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2009"}
