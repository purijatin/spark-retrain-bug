This product is no exception.  I have had to RMA several of these items over the last year.  Linksys support is outsourced, meaning poor communication.  Also, the support department is no longer about providing support, but will instead try to throw roadblocks in your path to keep you from replacing your defective product.  Expect several calls and at least a week to replace a defective product through Linksys if you have never had to run their gauntlet before.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "POOR Customer Service", "unixReviewTime": 1204761600, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2008"}
