At that time I was impressed with the product but was having problems (may or may not have been related to my use of DSL and/or PPPoE with my ISP).I have since upgraded to v1.36 of the firmware and am happy to report that I am no longer experiencing problems.  My Linux machine automatically PINGs an IP address every five minutes - this is logged and I am no longer seeing outages.So overall I give the product 4 out of 5 stars.  It's a great product, but unfortunately I feel Linksys should have tested/discovered the PPPoE problems in advance.  The documentation for the product could also be enhanced/improved.Peter", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Update to my earlier reviews:  PPPoE now works fine", "unixReviewTime": 972432000, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2000"}
