Previously, my computer and the one that was here already both had dialup connections. One is XP Home and the other XP Pro. They both had network cards but they weren't used until now. First I set up the cable modem on the other computer. All was well and I decided to share the connection with my computer. So I picked this router up (and a $10 rebate too). Installation went like this:1. Powered everything down.2. Opened box, rummaged around.3. Took plug from original computer and put in router (in \"Internet\" spot).4. Took included network cable and plugged into computer and into router (in one of the 4 spots).5. Took network cable I had laying around (you will have to buy one for each computer/laptop you want to connect if you don't have it!!!) and plugged into my computer.6. Powered up everything.7. Grabbed the manual to see what was next while the Windows'es loaded. Looked up and noticed the icon on both PC's \"acquiring network address\". When that went away, checked websites - VIOLA! I didn't have to do anything else!And I thought I'd be at this all day. I love this thing ;) I imagine it would be more difficult to set up on Windows 98 (ugh) but with 2 Win XP's it was a breeze.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing!
