Hooking it up and installation was a cinch and I have no problems whatsoever.  I only use it for my PC, PS2, and my Xbox but everything works fine.  I can play Madden online while my brother plays the Xbox online and my wife shops on the internet with the PC at the same time.  It's great.  I truly recomend it for you gamers out there who tired of hooking and unhooking your cable modem to and from your PS2's and Xbox's.  Also the price can't be beat! GET IT NOW!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1055548800, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2003"}
