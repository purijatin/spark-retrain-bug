Not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine.UPDATE 9/14/2013:  These batteries are still running as strong as they were when I purchased them, so I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  They work great in my work light, Fenix TK35, which is a highly demanding power consuming unit.  I completely recommend these for anyone who is a LEO, EMS or similar line of work.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great with my Fenix TK35 - 1 1/2 year UPDATE", "unixReviewTime": 1334448000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2012"}
