However, it's disposable.  Expect to buy another one within a 2-3 years.  After just over 2 years, mine died (it only came with a 1 year warrenty).  While it still works, I have to reset it by unplugging it and then plugging it back in several times a day (like 10-20).  Then you have to wait about a minute for all the computers to deal with the reset.  This sort of disposable lifespan seems pretty par for the course for Linksys consumer products.I was gullible enough to replace my first with a second (like I said they are cheap and cheap).  The second has lasted longer but every time the house power goes out I have to reset the router using Linksys' Netset utility which means physically connecting a computer directly to the router - which is a pain for me since I keep it in a closet next to my patch panel.  Netset works fine except it is Windows only.  So, Linksys are not Mac friendly (though Macs will work with their products).So this is my last Linksys product.  I replace my Linksys wireless AP with an Apple Airport Extreme - much more stable.So in short, with Linksys - you get what you pay for - they are cheap and cheap.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Easy to Use But Short Lifespan", "unixReviewTime": 1117497600, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2005"}
