It's a bit frustrating on the pocketbook. It's not Linksys fault - living in Florida, the lightning capital of the world, really has much to blame for my current Linksys router problems.Primarily, though, I am very pleased with this router. Straight and to the point - IT WORKS VERY WELL! And the setup is quite easy. I got it up and running within minutes linking 3 PCs and 1 game system to our cable modem without needing directions. And they all had no problems accessing the internet. I didn't even need to tweak the settings for the game system, as I had to do before with the previous Linksys I had.My first Linksys lasted two years. Reviews of that particular model revealed a consistent 2 year working life. I was concerned about that when I purchased this model, but figured that even if I got only two years out of it, I got my money's worth. Unfortunately, this one barely lasted a year so I'm a bit disappointed. However, like I stated before, it wasn't due to the router itself. We had a severe lightning storm and it did some damage to several items in my home: the router, lan card, printer port, the phone line, and half of the alarm system. I'm fortunate that it was limited to just that. I may have avoided the problem altogether had I used a surge protector.I've purchased another brand router for now with slightly different features. However, I won't hesistate to go back to Linksys if need be if this different brand model turns out to be a dud.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "When it works it works GREAT! Easy set up.
