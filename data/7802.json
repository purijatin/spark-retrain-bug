It dropped my connection constantly, it needed to be reset daily in order to work.  Linksys tech support was absolutely horribly, and the people there barely spoke english.  IThe Linksys is also made of cheap plastic, not very durable at all, the Netgear router is metal, very sturdy.  Amazon was awesome when i called them and told them the product was ..., and they accepted my return ....  I then got the Netgear RT314, and wow, it has worked without issue for well over a year now, not one single glitch.  Their tech support is very fast and generally very helpful, especially when I have contacted them about issues for things I was just trying to do, basically for using it to set up game and ftp servers and such.  Excellent buy, don't look at any other company for routers.  I am also using one of their Netork Hard drives, print servers, hub, and network cards, all have given me ZERO problems!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Total junk and l;ousy company", "unixReviewTime": 1010448000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2002"}
