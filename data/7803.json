Baker", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewtext": "I've owned this product for a few years now, and it recently just died - the ethernet switch portion is completely dead, which means no computer using ethernet can be attached to it, although the WAN connection still works (which still renders it useless).Perhaps my negative impressions are mostly due to me being an early adopter of this product.  I found the docutmentation to be poorly written, and some features half-implemented (the firewall/Internet security portion of the product).  I use a Mac, and the firmware upgrades only work using a PC (since I use Virtual PC, I was able to perform updates).  I paid nearly $200 for the product, but now it costs a lot less.  So is $200 a good deal for 2 years of performance?  I'm not so sure.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good, but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1021248000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2002"}
