Schroeter", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewtext": "When you get through the technical side of setting this product up, you'll find that adding, and removing devices (usually PC's) to the network is a sinch.I use this product to split off my Internet Access to 4 pc's in my house. I had some slight setup problems when i began, but calling techsupport and having them help me was a breeze.Now i simply plug my modem Cable wire into the Wide Area Network (WAN) port, and my computers Cable wires into the \"pc\" slots, and the entire network is off and running.Simply add some of the Network Adapters (software that allows devices to communicate between themselves) and you're off and venturing into some extra-ordinary territory!You can play games online (without crashing: a hub-like symptom which is non-existen here) and you can do other things like share internet connection, share files, and share a printer among many users.Good for Small business use ore home use.The price of one month of Internet access will buy you unlimited connections in one house!Although you can now buy the \"wireless\" version of the same product it can get costly. So watch out. It may be suffice to get this one for the price... (also remember that if you buy the wireless product that you will not only pay more for it, but you'll be required to buy more expensive network cards (wireless) ones that will interface with your Router.The wireless one is generally (2) twice as expensive, as are the network cards.Note: network cards are the devices you need to have in your computer that allows you to plug into the router. (it is the thing the cable wire plugs into in the back of your computer). Suffice to say, if you are using Cable now (for internet access) you'll be fine to buy and set this up.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Once Set-up, works like a charm!", "unixReviewTime": 1042588800, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2003"}
