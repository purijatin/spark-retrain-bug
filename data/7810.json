I've upgraded and downgraded firmware trying to find something that was really solid and reliable.  I've come to the conclusion this unit is good for a small, non-critical network, but it has reliability issues.Since Cisco took over Linksys, the long-term stability and reliability of their products has diminished in my opinion.  This router works well, but it will occasionally freeze up for no reason and require a hard reset/power cycle to work again.  Also this unit will sometimes reset and reload factory default information with no notice.  If you change the default admin password you may find it reset back to the default.  Sometimes it will just lock-out and you have to do a hard reset (pressing the reset button while powering up) to reload factory defaults.  This router should not be used in any environment where it would be left unattended for long periods of time.  It simply is not reliable in that capacity.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not the same quality product", "unixReviewTime": 1205712000, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2008"}
