This one is still in warranty, but the customer service claims they don't recognize the dealer and that it is probably a re-furbished one. The dealer probably sells more of these than any other dealer in Canada, and it was definitely a new one. The dealer told me they always tell everyone this so they don't have to replace anything, and to just keep calling back until you get someone on the phone that actually knows something.I had also previously contacted on-line help, who gave me the instructions on how to fix it. Of course being that this product is cooked, the instructions were useless. I replied to their e-mail of our conversation and told them this, and asked what I was supposed to do to get warranty, but of course they never replied back.This product is just not worth the trouble of buying, nor is it worth the trouble of trying to get your warranty fulfilled.I have read that Netgear makes very dependable routers. Never a Cisco product again.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Junk w/ poor customer service.", "unixReviewTime": 1295308800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2011"}
