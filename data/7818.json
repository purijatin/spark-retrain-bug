The installation was a breeze.just plug in your cable/dsl modem to one port and your computers to another port. (they are all marked so you can't go wrong) When you first turn it on you can change all the settings through your web browser. The settings are easy to change and configure and the istructions are great for explaining every single posible setting so if you don't know you can always check the manual. The firewall works great no need for any software firewall. Pc and mac can both be connected at the same time. Doesn't slow down your connecting or anything like that. And its at a great price. Hands down a must buy for anyone with a high-speed connection.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to install no Problems!", "unixReviewTime": 1014422400, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2002"}
