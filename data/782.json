They work as advertised. When you check them with a meter they show over 3 volts, but under load they do not hurt the light. Have been using them for a while now. Hold a charge VERY well, and no longer have to buy throw away 123A's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Work GREAT!!", "unixReviewTime": 1192406400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2007"}
