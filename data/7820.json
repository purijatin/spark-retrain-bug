It turned out to be a fairly good product. Why four stars? The setup through my cable (@home) was a nightmare. Lot of different things to change and configure.(too many to name) I consider myself very computer literate in software/hardware, and this was a nightmare.That being said the support at linksys was very good. Very easy to work with and friendly.Now that my system is up and running with wireless support it was all worth the hassel. But the setup is not for the faint of heart. May be better off getting the wireless adapter with the router built in.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Expensive but wotrth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1007942400, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2001"}
