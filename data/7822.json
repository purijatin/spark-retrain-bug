Great product. As others have mentioned, this device has &quot;hung&quot; occasionally, but I'm not sure whether that's the device or ISP's fault. Simple to configure (easier than the BeadleNet SOHO alternative). 255 NAT'ed DHCP clients. Works great. Good work, Linksys!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple home broadband access device that works!", "unixReviewTime": 997660800, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2001"}
