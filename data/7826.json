Trying to keep my kids off my work computer has been a challenge -- they like the high-speed connection, and I don't blame them.I bought this router to see if it would solve the problem. I have a desktop PC, a laptop PC and two iMacs.  Using the &quot;quick start&quot; directions, I set this router up and plugged everything in.  Amazingly, after enabling TCP/IP on the iMacs, everything worked perfectly...first time!  The laptop has a USB&gt;ethernet connecter rather than a straight ethernet card, and even *that* machine worked well, with minimal fiddling around.I'm thrilled, the kids are thrilled...  Worth every dime...!  I was ready to pay someone to come out to the house and run cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing product!", "unixReviewTime": 976320000, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2000"}
