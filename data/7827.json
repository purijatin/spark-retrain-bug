My first one was working fine until I decided to go through the firmware upgrade process.  Following the directions laid out by Linksys, the firmware update ended up making my router unusable.  I called tech support and after waiting forever, the tech basically told me it was unfixable and I'd have to go buy another one.  He never really asked me too many questions and just seemed interested in getting me off the phone and in the store to buy another one.  I ended up having that first one for 2 years.So I go purchase another one and have been using it for going on 3 years roughly.  It works great, easy to setup and gives me lots of home network expandability.I'm not a computer guru so I can't comment on it's technical aspects but I've never had any problems that were interent, home network or virus related with this product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product, piss poor customer service!", "unixReviewTime": 1222560000, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2008"}
