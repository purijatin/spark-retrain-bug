Now, that is the trick because the buyer has no control over the configuration. Allow me to explain:I have two laptops and a PS3 system. I recently upgraded from dial up access (cough...choke...puke) to DSL (yay!! Fast as hell!). The company supplying the DSL did not sell multiport modems, which is insane in today's technologically crazed society! Anyway, so I have DSL in place and I'm attempting to install this router so I can have DSL access for all of my toys. It should be as simple as a \"plug and play, follow the instructions\" setup.It is/was not. I had to call Linksys Tech support to walk me through a complicated ONLINE UPGRADE/CONFIGURATION of their router BEFORE I could even use it. This is crazy!! Whatever happened to \"follow the instructions\" and it works?!?! I have installed many IT systems through my years of work and have not had any issues setting up routers, until now.To Linksys credit, their tech support was fantastic and they got me up and running in a short amount of time (Thank You!!!).However...come on...why does it have to be this way?Happy Holidays,Smacka", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bitter Sweet...", "unixReviewTime": 1197936000, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2007"}
