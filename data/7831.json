If you don't have much time and money... If you're afraid to ask your geek friends for help, then this product is for you!  I purchased this device around November of 2000, despite my super-geeky friend mocking me and putting me down and criticizing my \"foolish purchase\".I would say this is my only time I'm ever right, and I've been using the Linksys ever since.  Why change proxy server software every few months and/or face constant upgrades (not to mention the time spent).  Why keep the \"proxy server/internet\" computer on 24/7?  With this Linksys you only pay for the device and hook up to as many computers as you like (without licensing restrictions).  You can turn on/off any computer as you please, it won't affect the internet sharing.  Plug in a printer with a built-in network card and you've got a dedicated network printer.  What genius!  Great for protecting your computer against outside attackers with a built-in firewall protection. Easy to use and configure with the browser.If you got broadband, don't [pay] extra for each computer hook-up.  The secret is to get one connection and share it all Through Your Linksys Router.  (be wary though some ISPs don't give support for LAN setups)Sure I should use wireless... Sure I've gotten spoiled using this device rather than learning how to setup a DHCP/NAT/proxy server and firewall, but who cares?  As long as it works, it works. If it ain't broke why fix it?  I give this product a 5 star rating! * * * * *", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best. Product. Ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1014076800, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2002"}
