It works fine for intranet communications, but it is constantly dropping the connection with the DSL modem. Often when it does try to reconnect, it will say the LCP Negotiation has failed (whatever that means), and there is not sufficient documentation that explains why this problem occurs. After all, if you are buying this router, you should always have your connection on, and not have to worry about the LCP Negotiation.
