I also set it up to route secure shell request from the internet to my one linux machine.  All great huh?... 3 days later all the lights on it were blinking (including power) and it was hot to touch.  Needless to say, it didn't work at all and couldn't be reset.I replaced it with another, so I obviously still think it's a good product for the price, but I would not use this product where robustness and reliability are required.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great design... questionable quality", "unixReviewTime": 1080518400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2004"}
