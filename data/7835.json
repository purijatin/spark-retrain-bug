I got the Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch up and runniing in a few minutes.  Better than that the Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch has been working flawlessly since the day I installed it.  Two computers have come and gone in that time, but the Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch goes on and on slaving away sending the little packets of info to wherever they go out there on the net.  I have three computers and a server on my home network and they are all happy.  They find the router with no problem whatsoever.For the money I paid this thing is a workhorse that just keeps on keeping on.  What and awesome life I'd lead if everything I buy worked as well as this.Enjoy folks.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I purchased this item on January 1, 2004.", "unixReviewTime": 1149206400, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2006"}
