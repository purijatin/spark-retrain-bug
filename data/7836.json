I had to get a world-class nerd to configure it for  a price, but it is great to use.When the system comes on, all is on.  I do not have to use software to connect to the internet or wait for my isp to connect.  It is on in an instant.  No problems whatsoever!It is easy to install and use, but complicated to configure.So what!  It works great.  Both computers seem to have better connection speeds also.
