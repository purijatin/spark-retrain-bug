It started freezing up, and then yesterday I returned to find a router that does not work.I have now spent 12+ hours and talked to 6 expert techs that have no idea how to fix this problem.  Most of the &quot;experts&quot; are less skilled in computer networking than I am and I am a film director.  Additionally, the software does not fire correctly, and once on the wrong path is not recoverable.Therefore, I would be very weary of jumping in.  When it works, it is beautiful, but when it crashes you are abandoned and without support or help....
