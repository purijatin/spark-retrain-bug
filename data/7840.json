If you are really a beginning level computer user it may be difficult.  If you have some computer hardware experience things work like a breeze.  I have it hooked up with two win98 computer and one win 95 computer using athome cable modem service.  It works flawlessly most of the time.My only compliant is that the power source makes a high pitched squeeling noise after being in use for extended periods.  You need to unplug it to get rid of the high pitched noise.The internet cable service told me that I would need to purchase extra IP addresses.  This thing will work without them.  Isn't that the point of using the router???  Don't listen to them if they tell you to pay extra money for extra computers hooked up to the modem.  The router does the job for you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great w/ Win98,95 and @home cable", "unixReviewTime": 975974400, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2000"}
