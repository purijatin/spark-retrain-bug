They work great for about 6 months, and then we start arguing about whose turn it is to reboot the router.The only problem is I have tried a few other brands and get anywhere from 1 to 3 months out of the others. So I buy two of these at a time, grin and bear it, and always have one ready for when the one in use starts showing signs of giving up -- like slow connections, dropped connections, etc.  Then we spend a few weeks unplugging it from power for 30 seconds and plugging it back in again to try to prolong its life.  Near the end, I just swap it out so that the kids can do their homework if I'm not around.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Worst Ethernet Router - Except for All the Rest", "unixReviewTime": 1295049600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2011"}
