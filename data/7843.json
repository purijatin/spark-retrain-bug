I returned it to get this linksys rounter.It is very easy.  Plug in the power, cable modem line, and line to the computers and your set.  This also gives a lot of options that admins might like, such as denial of internet access to ceratin accounts.I also like it because it is slim, and fits right in my computer table.  The lights are logical, and i do not notice a loss in performance with other computers online.This also comes with a built-in firewall that prevents most attacks.  The firewall also does not interfear with anything, so its a added bonus.~hope this helps", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1037750400, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2002"}
