You have heard all that, BUTmy first router quited after 11 months and 2 weeks. The connection was intermittent. Took a weekend to isolate and identify the source of the problem. Its the router's (not the cable modem, the ISP network, the network cards, the OSs or the computers connecting to the router). Customer support is so so. Gone thru the diagnostic routines quite a few times before support admited that the router was bad. Took three to four weeks and many emails/phone calls to get a replacement. Replacement was a DOA. Took another 3-4 weeks to replace the replacement. Make you wonder its reliability.
