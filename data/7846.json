Basically leaving the windows machines non descript setup by default and putting in a couple of things in the mac and alligning through the router's address in a browser.Flawless. And it keeps on ticking with no problems.(I apologize to those with individual broadband issues with their  local IP.)You really can't go wrong with this; give it a try and enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Windoze and Mac - It's too easy", "unixReviewTime": 1004140800, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2001"}
