Tom", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "Although Linksys does not officially support the Macintosh, this router is easily configured via a your web browser so it can be configured fine on a Macintosh.The unit works well with no problems. In fact, using DHCP, you don't really have to do much configuring at all. Just plug it between your computer and your cable or dsl modem. Their 24/7 tech support is a plus. The firewall provides added security against people hacking into your machine. The unit also has 4 ports so you can share your high speed internet access with other computers. Or if a friend comes over with a laptop, he can jack into the 'net at high speeds as well!I would recommend this unit due to the price and the Linksys tech support. You should pay under $[money] for this.There are other routers out there that do the same thing so price and functionality are really the only factors to consider.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good price, easy to configure even on a Mac", "unixReviewTime": 1020556800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2002"}
