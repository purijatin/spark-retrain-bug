Easy to setup. The internal LAN runs at 100Mbps. The built-in firewall is great for Cable-Modem & DSL users whose PCs are exposed to the Net without this firewall. It also looks nice. Won't go wrong getting this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Happy Linksys user", "unixReviewTime": 993427200, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2001"}
