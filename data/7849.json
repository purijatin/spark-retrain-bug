We have a cable modem, from which we wanted to share the connection on all computers.  The setup was immidiate and very simple, just plug and play.  The router worked, i went through the router admin page and within no more than 2-3min i was surfing the internet on all computers.  The home networking setup, so that all computers can see each other and print on our main printer was a little bit more complicated, but not because of the router, it was hard to make the WIN2000 grant connection and user rights to the WINME machine.  I GIVE THIS PRODUCT AAA RATING - EXCELLENT!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Router to Share a Cable Modem and Files", "unixReviewTime": 1086048000, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2004"}
