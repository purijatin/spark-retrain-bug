This router/hub allows you to share your single internet connection provided by cable modem or DSL to multiple computers.  Using the uplink port, you can stick in a hub and theoretically support up to 253 computers.This box contains 4 auto-sensing 10/100 ports.  Installation is a snap and no software is needed.  You plug in Internet provider's network cable (RJ45) into the WAN port and power it up.  The box acts as a DHCP client and gets an IP address.  Once that's done, you can plug in your other computers into the Linksys box and share the same connection.  The router supports DHCP and acts as a DHCP server to your computer.  It also uses NAT (Network Address Translation) that essentially makes up IP addresses internally and hides all of your computers behind the router.  All your computers going out to the Internet appear as they are using the same IP address.  This box also acts as a firewall blocking out all of your ports.The box even has a DMZ host option that allows one PC on your network to be exposed to the Internet, providing unrestricted two-way communication between a machine and an Internet service.  You probably don't want to do that, but it's there if you need to.In a nutshell, the Etherfast Cable/DSL router is very simple to operate yet powerful and easy to manage using the web based admin app.  A must buy if you need to share your Internet connection.  I like the 4 port version so much, I just upgraded to the 8 port version.  Great job Linksys.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerful, simple and easy to manage - Excellent Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1008720000, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2001"}
