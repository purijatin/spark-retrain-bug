It just stops working without evident reason. I upgraded the firmware with the latest version without results. The problem might be somwhere else but it is not- to my best knowledge, and the employees from Linksys could not give me a satisfactory anser to that problem after several calls of mine either. Maybe it will work better with a different setup but is this normal? Maybe it needs a newer firmware? I Don't recommend this product anyway.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It's good when it works !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1071100800, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2003"}
