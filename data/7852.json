Following the CD to INSTALL it, is essential, and easy to do.  But there is no manual, no quickstart guide, and no trouble-shooter that comes with it.  All of those things are on the CD; limited as that is.  And to make personal settings, refine it, or trouble-shoot it; you have to go online, and do research.  The internal settings can be VERY complicated.  I'm attempting to use it for my TiVo to transfer recordings from my TiVo to my PC.  It is taking almost more work than is worth the effort.  The Router itself works exactly as it should.  Since there is no manual, and findind Linksys Tech Support is very difficult; I'd suggest finding a good tech support place online, read it, and see if you want to delve into all that this type of connection may require.  All in all, I may go back to NOT using a router at all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Installation, no user manual", "unixReviewTime": 1178928000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007"}
