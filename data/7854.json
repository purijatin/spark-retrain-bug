It works exactly as advertised, with no fuss, and at the prices they're selling for these days, what more can you want?  My experience with this router made me a big Linksys fan (I've subsequently bought 3 other Linksys devices are all have been equally dependable.)UPDATE: my router died about one year after this review was posted (not a bad life, I guess) and I was so impressed with the first one that I bought another.  Big mistake.  The Cisco merger has not been kind to Linksys, apparently, because my new BEFSR41 was erratic from the moment it arrived and finally become unbearable after about a year.  I finally replaced it a couple of months ago with a Trendnet BVR204 and have been very happy.  I have bought about six Linksys products over the years, but never again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid -- or it used to be", "unixReviewTime": 1079222400, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2004"}
