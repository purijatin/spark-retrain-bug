Without a hitch after the short setup procedure, I had the house networked and humming.  Great speed and nearly idiot-proof installation.  The only worry is that it does get a bit warm, especially if you stack another router or hub on top.  The only other minor complaint is that the AC adapter plug is rather easy to yank out - especially if you are moving cables frequently.  Other than that, it's worth every little, insignificant cent versus unplugging, reacquiring, etc. to the Internet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Out of the box winner", "unixReviewTime": 1006819200, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2001"}
