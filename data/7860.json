Makiling", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewtext": "This would be the perfect router if it included SPI Firewall capabilities, but it does serve its purpose. I have mine connected to a Motorola SB4220 SURFboard cable modem with Cox as my ISP. The combination of the 2 allows me up to 3Mbps downloads, which is FLYING! Setup was pretty easy, just follow the instructions, and your surfing the Internet. The Network Address Translator (NAT) is pretty cool, but you need to do some additional tweaking for a more secure connection. I went to DSLreports.com to have my IP address probed. It told me that UDP ports 67-68, and UDP ports 134-139 were open and that it could be a possible threat. So I logged on as the Administrator and filtered UDP ports 67-68 and 137-139, had my IP address re-probed and passed the port scan report with flying colors. Basically it said that my IP address did not show any threats for my default TCP and UDP ports. I also have the Internet Connection Firewall enabled in Windows XP and have Zone Alarm installed on my computer. So I feel pretty secure surfing the Internet, but I also realize if a really good hacker really wants to get into my system, he or she will.Overall, this is a great little router! I will however, upgrade to a firewall router with Stateful Packet Inspection capabilities in the future. Not quite 5 stars, but close!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Needs Stateful Packet Inspection Firewall Capabilities", "unixReviewTime": 1065830400, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2003"}
