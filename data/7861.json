Fuhgeddaboudit. 99.9% chance that it's just fine. The HomePNA 2.0 ([...]) technology used on this card and others like it is designed to deal with all kinds or normal and wierd phone wiring situations. Don't waste time or money having someone check out your phone wire... the technology developers already did that for you and made this stuff so that it would work.To answer the reviewers other comment, an easy way to hook PC's and Printers by HPNA phoneline networking to a Cable/DSL connection is to use the Linksys HomePNA Cable/DSL router announced a month ago. Should be shipping in the late Feb timeframe. CHeck with Linksys on it... this is different than the bridge for sale in Amazon... the bridge makes you have to have a real IP address for each PC. The upcoming Router will allow you to share the one IP address you get from your cable/DSL company with all the stuff in the house. That's the deal you probably want.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This stuff works well", "unixReviewTime": 981763200, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2001"}
