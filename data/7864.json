I have another computer in another part of my house which, until recently, was used to access AOL via a dialup line.I installed this phoneline network card on that computer, put PPPOE on it, modified the AOL access to go through a LAN, and bought the Linksys HomeLink Broadband Network Bridge. I connected the AOL computer to it via the this phoneline network card.Now this computer access the internet via the DSL modem. It worked first time. No muss, no fuss. AOL access is now completely reliable, and it flies!I was very impressed with how easy it was to make this work. I have some understanding of networking, but not a lot.
