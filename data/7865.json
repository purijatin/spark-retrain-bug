Only a coupleof manufacturers made these products, and Black Box might still carry itin their private label version.There never was a bridge to broadband until now. It was and still is away to create a network using twisted-pair wiring between computers toshare files and resources like printers, modems, etc. You can be on thephone and access the modem on another PC connected to a different phoneline, giving you access to your desktop while talking. That was a typicalapplication with 286/386 machines before Windows.For best results, use CAT8 installed in newer houses like mine, or evengo to twisted pair network cable like Belden 88778. You might exceed 1mbper second if you maintain the shielding right to the HPN200 bracket byattaching the drain wire to it with a screw, or screwing the bracket inthe case slot holder with the drain wire. The RJ-11C jack side must havea ground connection for the drain wire on the phone jack. Using a surgeprotector with telco protection can provide a good grounding point also,and is recommended, as you WILL BE connected to the PSTN even though notusing its facilities (like dial-up).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Data Over Voice", "unixReviewTime": 1234742400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2009"}
