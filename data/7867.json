First, I have noticed that most USB NIC's only support 10Mbps connections, which was a problem for our network infrastructure.  The other problem was that most of them were not Windows 2000 compatabile (no, the 3com is not compatible).  This one is 10/100 and is Windows 2000 compatible.  However, they are not ideal.  The USB bus only support 16Mbps output, so you are limited to this even on a 100Mbps connection, which is why I am tell you.  If you can go another way, you should.  The do work well though, I recomend them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If you can go another way, you should.", "unixReviewTime": 980553600, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2001"}
