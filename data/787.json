So for 4 batterys figure 8 hours. I only use one at a time so that's roughly four nights on my NOD.Additional information - I used it by doing a direct plugin to my solar charger and it powered up two RC123A batteries to 90% charge in an 11 hour (sunrise till sunset) day.The link for the Amanzon solar charger is:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H36S0G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_sol_prd_title#sf", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Smart Charger for RCR123A Batteries", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}
