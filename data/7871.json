Since it's well-supported by every Linux and Windows that I've tried, it let me get two different laptops online long enough to get drivers working for their built-in ethernet and wifi adapters. It would also be useful for adding an additional adapter to a computer to act as a bridge or do any other network tinkering. The driver floppy was a nice touch. I'm not sure my son had ever seen one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for getting stuff working", "unixReviewTime": 1343952000, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2012"}
