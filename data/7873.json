It does *not* come with a CAT-5 UTP Cable, but I have plenty spare and hooked it up. As soon as it was wired to both the TiVo and a hub in my nearby wiring closet the link light was activated. I did not need any of the manuals or driver disks that came in the package.Within minutes I'd configured my TiVo to recognize the network adapter and my Linksys BEFSR41 Firewall/Router had allocated it a DHCP address.I immediately ran the test-connection and also forced a daily update.Downloading schedules are super quick compared to the dialup option. Obviously new firmware updates will also be significantly quicker. Plus the phone line won't be tied up during the call.I had previously tried a different USB/Ethernet adapter and my TiVo did not recognize it (D-Link USB-650) so beware of using that on a TiVo.The Linksys USB100TX is the wired adaptor recommended by TiVo and it works perfectly, first time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "TiVo connectivity made simple", "unixReviewTime": 1070409600, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2003"}
