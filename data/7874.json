Baird \"Author &#34;Engineering You...", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I needed a powered Hub to make this USB product work on a Sony Vaio Laptop.  I was connected via a long 50-100 foot ethernet cable to my Linksys Router, and there evidently was not enough signal to drive it.  I simply added a powered hub, into which I connected the laptop, and then it all worked.  This USB-adapter is still a better soultion than using the one PC Card slot which was needed by my CD-ROM drive.  When installing, I initially failed to insert the included floppy disk with the WINXP driver, and I had to re-install and remove the device a number of times before it worked.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Needed a powered Hub to make it work on a Vaio Laptop", "unixReviewTime": 1010966400, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2002"}
