On the linksys, I had problems with mice being recognized and having mouse clicks missed. On bootup, I could not have my laptop attached if it was not on port 1, since it would then think the mouse was not attached no matter what mouse or trackball I used.I have none of these problems with the Belkin product. Also, from an ergonomic point of view, the belkinproduct is set up much better, with the cables all attaching from the back (except the console mouse/keyboard cables). Also, the belkin product is less expensive.Obviously, I would suggest forgetting the linksys and buying the belkin kvm.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "OK, but Belkin product better", "unixReviewTime": 1034553600, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2002"}
