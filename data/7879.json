First, the video cables were M-F rather than M-M like most other switches so I had to buy new cables just for this thing.  Second, after hooking up all the cables, I see how awkward it is to place this on a desktop with cables sticking out in 3 different directions (same complaint as another reveiwer).  Third, the switch's hot keys would not switch between computers - instead, it would just rotate my screen 90-180 degrees!  Forth, I called Linksys support and after about 5 &quot;please wait while I look something up&quot; I got transferred to their sales department and they said I had to buy their cables.  After I told them that was unacceptable, they offered to sell me a new router...  Ugh!  I'm returning this POS as soon as possible.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Really bad product and even worse support", "unixReviewTime": 1079049600, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2004"}
