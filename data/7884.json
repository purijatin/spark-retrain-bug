I am very happy with my  choice.The switch supports video resolutions up to 1920x1440.  In the  past, I found other low-cost KVM switches show noticeable image  deterioration above 1024x768.There is a easy-to-use button on the device  to switch among your machines.  LED's on top tell you which machine you  have selected. You can also switch between machines using the keyboard.  There are three KVM switching modes via keyboard:Switch directly:...  Go to machine N:  Alt, Ctrl, Shift, {1 2 3 or 4}, EnterAuto-Scan (3  second interval):...  Begin Auto-scan: Alt, Ctrl, Shift, 0, Enter....  Stop auto-scan: SpacebarUp/down mode (Make it easy to quickly  switch between machines):...  Begin Up/down mode:  Alt, Ctrl, Shift, 0,  Enter...  Go to previous machine: Left-Shift...  Go to next machine:  Right-Shift...  Stop up/down mode: SpacebarUnlike some KVM switches,  you hit Alt, Ctrl, and Shift in order, one-at-a-time.  You don't  &quot;chord&quot; the keys together.  (This actually is a benefit in my  case -- I use the Emacs editor in Linux, and my previous  &quot;cheapie&quot; KVM switch had a Ctrl-Alt-key combination command that  conflicted with the editor.)The ProConnect doesn't have an  On-Screen-Display that tells you the name of the selected computer.  I use  OSD-enabled switches for work in the datacenter; but, given this unit's  price, not having OSD is an acceptable limitation for the home-office.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great switch for home/office/hobbyist use", "unixReviewTime": 967939200, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2000"}
