I use it with 4 PC's and it switches without a hitch.  You'll need to pick up the cable kits - be sure and order them with the unit.  Regular cables obviously wont work.  I velcro'd mine under my desk, then used wire holds to secure the wires.  Great buy. I also purchased the 2 unit model for use at home.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's not rocket science!", "unixReviewTime": 1015200000, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2002"}
