One of the pcs is my web/email machine and the other is a gaming machine.  The CTRL CTRL mechanism for switching between pcs works great and has only been a problem in some games where CTRL is used for something else.  I'd say this has occurred less than 2% of the time though.The only thing that I would like to see is the addition of speaker support, but that really isn't in any of the KVM switch products.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product that will save you space!", "unixReviewTime": 1148428800, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2006"}
