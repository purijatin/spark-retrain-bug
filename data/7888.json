Is the unit light?  Yes, but i just have it hanging below my desk out of the way so who cares.  It connects both of my computers to one monitor/keyboard/mouse for $60 which is exactly what I wanted.  The only thing to be aware of is that some IBM machines (like my old P166 Thinkpad) may not work with this product--check Linksys's site for details.  I don't think this is Linksys's fault though, so I don't take it off my rating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works exactly as promised.", "unixReviewTime": 991785600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2001"}
