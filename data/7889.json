I also use a 17&quot; flat panet LCD monitor and the video quality is very good. The only thing I don't like about the unit is that the cables for the 2 pc's are on the sides of the unit. If it were a bit bigger and all the connectors on the rear... I would have rated 5 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice KVM for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1013385600, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2002"}
