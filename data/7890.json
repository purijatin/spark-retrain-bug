I'm using a 21\" monitor and see no image ghosting on the display.  The image qualtiy is extremely sharp.  I noticed that the unit automatically switches to display on which ever PC I power on so there's no need to switch the box to the correct setting.  I find that double-CTRL click works great to switch between systems.  There is a couple seconds of delay but it saves me having to manually switch a unit which used to take me at least a couple seconds.  After reading the other reviews I decided to check the unit with the mouse scroll wheel.  It works fine with the Microsoft optical mouse that I use.I had been using a mechanical SVGA box to switch the monitor between PCs and manually swapped between mouse and keyboards.  What a pain!  For [$] more this unit does it all without even leaving the keyboard!  I wish I had known about this item a few months ago...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT value", "unixReviewTime": 1019088000, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2002"}
