After using KVM's for years I have never had the problems like I have had with this.  Other manufacturers manage to use Ctrl keys for their hotkey functions without the problems that this box plagues you with.While this box may have garnered rave reviews from the folks who want to play Linux, etc., I have to say to use this on a primary production machine will eventually drive you nuts.  If you are always using constant Ctrl or Shift operations to mass select items you will constantly find that your key press was not registered.  In addition, sometimes your mouse will just freeze until you click a button again.Oh well, the same goes for all Linksys products... they are a bit cheaper than what you would normally pay *but* you get what you pay for.  Suitable for home or dorm but not for an all day production machine.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor hotkeys make it unbearable.", "unixReviewTime": 990144000, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2001"}
