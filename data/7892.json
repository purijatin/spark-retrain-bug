However, in the process of doing all this, I hung out in several photography threads and found several comments about the original Elph that ultimately decided me against it. Several people remarked that the camera developed mechanical problems after only about a year, just after the warranty ran out, and which were very expensive to fix. Then I happened to talk to a friend, and it turned out she had purchased an Elph that had had similar problems but they had happened early enough so they could return it. Anyway, notwithstanding these problems, the Canon Elph is probably the APS camera that saved the APS format. No doubt these issues have been fixed in the Elph 2, so if someone really wanted to purchase one, it's probably okay to do so at this point.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A few comments", "unixReviewTime": 998956800, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2001"}
