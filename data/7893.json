After having spent some time with it, I like the new one a bit better because of the neat new features: 1 -- you can change film midroll which is neat if you want to shoot different film for different conditions 2 -- If you know you just took a great shot, you can specify how many prints you want made up to 9!  I wish mine had that feature.  You can also use it for the following shot, but that's it. 3 -- the flash doesn't stick up any more so it can't get stuck 4 -- it has a new zoom device which works better and is more convenient. Plus, it takes the same great pictures in 3 modes that the old Elf did.  I agree that Panormanic shoots of far off mountains are better with an SLR, but almost every other kind of shot looks just fine with the Elf.  It's amazing how camera quality this good can be had for such a price. For proud parents -- the best part of the Elf is that it's TINY and you can keep it in your  purse.  I've taken zillions of rolls whereas with my older bigger camera, I never took it with me.  You don't have to give up much to get this great quality.  Wait no more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Includes some nifty new features from the elph 1", "unixReviewTime": 985651200, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2001"}
