I took a Canon Elph Jr. with me to Rome in the fall of 1999, and the  pictures came out beautifully.  The Elph 2 has the 2x zoom feature, but  otherwise it's very similar.  The APS photosystem is easy to use, and the  index prints and negatives that stay in the canister are great for those of  us who aren't terribly organized.  All the canisters stay in a book-sized  holder with the index prints.  As a result, I give far more photo gifts  than I used to, because I always know where the negatives are when I need  to order reprints.  I was particularly struck by the clarity of the photos,  the richness of the colours, and the ease of use of the camera.  While the  24mm APS format is smaller than the 35mm standard film, the resolution is  still excellent.  Far better than any digital camera under $1000.  One of  the most useful characteristics is the tiny size.  Because it fits  anywhere, I take it with me in my napsack and shoot photos of anything I  find interesting.  If you purchase a $100 flatbed scanner to scan photos  for your web page, or to send via email, these Elphs offer a far better  bargain than any digital camera or film camera available today.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing little camera for casual photographers", "unixReviewTime": 965952000, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2000"}
