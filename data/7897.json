They are incredibly compact, very sturdily built and take wonderful pictures. The Elph 2 has a smooth 2:1 zoom and a much-improved flash unit (over the original Elph 1). While I prefer my Elph LT270, whichever Elph you choose will make you happy for years to come.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Everyone Loves an Elph!", "unixReviewTime": 1008028800, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2001"}
