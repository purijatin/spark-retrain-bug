The miniature size and high quality production materials make this product a thing to put on a pedestal.  But what do you care if it doesn't perform?  Well it does just  great in all sorts of light conditions.  I've taken it to Washington State  where the sun don't shine too brightly with Fuji 200ASA - great panoramic  shots with good color. After 6 months with this camera - I haven't used my  35mm Olympus. However, those of you who are really into detail will find  the Advanced film quality slightly unacceptable.The controls are just  fabulous - the best is the zoom lever - immediate zoom speed without a lot  of time lapse.  The actual zoom ratio isn't that great but you have to give  up something for its size.  It's got all the standard red-eye, fill-in,  timer functions, plus a bunch of nifty time-date-stamp buttons.  The back  display gives you all the info in logical layout.The only thing you need  to watch out for is the standard 2-step focus and shoot process.  Because  this gem is so small, it's easy to move the camera while trying to get a  good shot.  And if you're thinking about the Elph 1 versus Elph 2 - I've  seen 2 of the Elph 1's in the camera shop with its flash stuck in the up  mode.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Little Killer", "unixReviewTime": 960422400, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2000"}
