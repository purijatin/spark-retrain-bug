Just turn  of the camera and pull out the old card and pop the ScanDisk card in. If  you you the card with a Olympus D460 camera, you can take over 300 pictures  at highest resolution.  For a little more money than the Olympus 32 mb card  you get twice the capacity. The only difference is that you can't take  panoramic shots. Save your 8 mb card for that. The nice thing about the  added memory for the camera is now I can take it on vacation and snap as  many pictures as I want without worrying about downloading them to a PC. My  next purchase will be a USB card reader because the serial connection on my  digital camera is painfully slow.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good choice if you want 64MB card.  Great w/ Digital Camera.", "unixReviewTime": 968284800, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2000"}
