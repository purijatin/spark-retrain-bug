The Rio 500 is so reluctant to recognize the external memory, you have to keep putting it in and taking it out ad nauseum before it finally decides to recognize it.  So I don't even do it!  I just get the one in there working, and erase that and fill it when I want to change music.  SmartMedia cards are real flimsy, not like Compact flash memory, and seem much more fragile.  If I was going to choose what kind of flash memory to have in a camera or mp3 player, I'd go with Compact flash or MM flash memory, they are more robust and not so fragile.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Doesn't  work so well in my Rio 500", "unixReviewTime": 1017705600, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2002"}
