The second (for a Diamond Rio) works fine  everytime. Of note, the formatting for a Diamond Rio is different from that  for anything else, so even SanDisk's USB (etc) readers cannot decipher data  on a card that has been in a Rio. For that you must use the RioPort  software or erase and reformat the card in the device in which you would  like to use it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works, usually.", "unixReviewTime": 969062400, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2000"}
