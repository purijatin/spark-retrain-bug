With comparos between the Sony Memory disk and compact flash card twice the thickness, there&#65533;s very little difference in r/w that I can notice.  Using the 5-shot digital &#65533;auto-winder&#65533; on the Olympus the card sucks the data down no problem.  Even with repeated semi-auto firing, the memory card performs decently.  It does lag 2048x1536 (medium quality) and it will do more so at higher levels &#65533; but it&#65533;s no worse than other formats.  USB download through OEM cables is rapid quick compared to the slower compact flash on Kodak DC265 for some reason.The physical size is unbeatable.  The wear and long term use is something to keep an eye on with the contacts exposed compared to the other formats.  At this price, I have no complaints buying a bunch and shooting without capacity worries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "inSanity for cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1009411200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2001"}
