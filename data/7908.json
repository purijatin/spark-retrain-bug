Zorn", "helpful": [13, 27], "reviewtext": "I have owned a variety of headphones over the years.  from very expensive electrostatic units to cheapy sony ear buds for my walkman.  these are by a wide margin the worst headphone I have ever heard!  why?  while they show the ability to resolve and have a wide dynamic range they have been tuned so drastically to emphasize the bass that they are virtually unlistenable. I am not exagerating the extent of bass boost...to get a sound similar to my reference headphones (a pair of Grado reference phones) I need to turn down the bass control on my reciever by 75%! they resolve, they play the highs and mids well...but the bass is for a teenager who has no desire other than to hear BOOM,BOOM. this is the headphone equivalent to those horribly annoying cars you hear at stop lights thumping and bothering the whole neighborhood...so if you're \"down\" you might like these...if you want to hear music reproduced ANYWHERE like it was meant...stay away!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "the worst!  really!", "unixReviewTime": 1016496000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2002"}
