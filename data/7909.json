However, these headphones are not what I would excpect for [the price].  The only genre I was comfortable listening to on them was Rock, and beyond that I felt the sounds was muddled and not very open.  They have a somewhat strange &quot;semi-open aire&quot; design which is not standard.  If you can afford them the Sennheiser HD-600's...are outstanding; however, for something nearer this price range, and usability I highly recomend the Grado SR-60's...They are less expensive, and sound much better.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very Comfortable, Average Sounds", "unixReviewTime": 970790400, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2000"}
