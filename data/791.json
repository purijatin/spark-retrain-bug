My experience using them in flashlights (Fenix, Sure Fire, etc) has been dismal.  Full charge = one hour of 'strobe'.  Contacted vendor and was told that \"these cells vary\" and that \"replacing them wouldn't help\".....so WHAT WOULD HELP?!?!Basically, the vendor says that these cells are worthless and unreliable.  Is that what you're looking for?  Go elsewhere.  The battery sucks and the vendor sucks.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't charge, don't last, don't buy!
