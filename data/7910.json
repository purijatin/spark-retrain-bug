I had a pair of Koss TD/80's that sounded acceptable, but were uncomfortable to wear for over 10 minutes.  These looked quite comfortable, and were about what I was looking to spend.  At first listen they seemed quite dull, favoring the mid to low sections and not at all the bright, responsive headphones that I was looking for.  Then I realized that I was driving them with my laptops internal card.  At home, it was a different story entirely.  The highs suddenly came out, and they responded like a decent pair of headphones.  I would definitely recommend using these only with a properly driven output device, or a headphone amp.  Also, these seemed to bring out the worst in my MP3 files.  All in all, only medium performance on typical equipment.  Better equipment brings out better sound.  I hear that the HD495's are better sounding on typical equipment for the same price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good headphones, but not for MP3's", "unixReviewTime": 983232000, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2001"}
