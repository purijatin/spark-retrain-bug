The HD490's or 495s would sound a bit better and a lot louder on your boom  box, another good choice would be the Grado SR-60 for you.I have owned  my pair of HD500's for about 6 months now, and I have been very pleased  with them.  While not perfect, they sound much better then what you find in  most stores.These headphones are not bright at all but rather warm, and  have a very laid back sound.  They also tend to exagerate bass somewhat,  which leads to a slightly boomy sound which I do not care for very much.  (People who like loud bass read that last sentence as:  These headphones do  produce a lot of loud, deep bass, particularly when asked to do so)  Those  sound qualities make them good for electronic music, as they do not sound  edgy or harsh, and bass is plentiful. They are not fatiguing to listen to  at all, in part due to the laid back sound. (I have had them on for 5 hours  straight)They also have excellent sound qualities for computer games too.  Explosions have force, and imaging is very good too, so you will hear  everything from where it is supposed to be coming from.That said, these  are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.  If you are more the  audiophile vareity I would personally reccomend the Sennheiser HD580s or  the 600s, they have a much more neutral sound that colors the music a lot  less.  They also absoluely require an amplifier to get decent sound out of  them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Warm, full sound with somewhat boomy bass", "unixReviewTime": 959644800, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2000"}
