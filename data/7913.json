I use them for listening to healing music (Tibetan Singing Bowls, binaural beat brain entrainment, and meditational music). I bought two of these some time ago; and the singular complaint is that the material covering the ear pads eventually breaks down and becomes sticky. I'd love to see them use a good quality leather in place of the plastic junk; but it is a minor consideration when you hear the quality of sound reproduction these things are capable of. Despite the problem with the cover material, I would buy another set or two of these in a heartbeat.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "By far, the best headphones I've ever owned...", "unixReviewTime": 1360540800, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013"}
