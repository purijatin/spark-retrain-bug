Sennheiser calls them the 570 Symphony. They are specificially engineered for symphony music and it is clear in the audio. If you want to listen to your Mp3s, buying these headphones may be a bit overboard. If you listen to vocal-oriented music like opera or live recordings the SSSS's will make you cringe. The midrange feels very wierd. They do make classical sound good.They also have absolutely amazing clarity. While the frequency responce is a bit ackward, if details of the sound is what you are looking for then these are what you are looking for. The Duofol technology, of which I was skeptical at first, is amazing. The sound is crisp and clear. There is no moaning and droaning from these headphones. The sound is very very detailed. These would be great for people listening through sound for small, quiet details or for sample editing when wavematching is needed. The detail provided is beautiful for that. So know what the headphones are designed for before you punch $130.00 into them. They help me, so I like them, but I can see that there may be some problems for some people.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, but not for everyone.", "unixReviewTime": 979430400, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2001"}
