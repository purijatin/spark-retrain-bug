They were getting a bit worn however, and I have already replaced the cords on both of them.  So I decided to try this headphone, mainly because the Amazon.com review said that the HD-570 was supposed to replace the HD-545.Well, the HD-570 definitely has a different sound compared to the HD-545's.  The Sennheiser website shows a frequency response chart for this headphone that describes it best, basically a  dip in the midrange frequencies.  And that's what I hear - the highs are quite sharp, the lows are definitely there, but the middle frequencies just seem to be dulled.  And so the sound that comes out of these headphones lacks the rich fullness and ringing clarity of the HD-545's.  With the highs and lows both registering fully, the sound can be both more shrill and booming at the same time, depending what's in the music that you are playing.  \"Muffled\" isn't quite the right word, since the highs still come through, but yes, these headphones sound muffled.Anyway, if you listen to the HD-570 exclusively, you can get used to the sound, it's not as bad as some of the reviews would make it.  It's only when I do a direct comparison with the HD-545's that I kind of regret getting these headphones.  Definitely, I like the HD-545's sound better, but then, I've been listening to them exclusively for about ten years or so.(...).Finally, there is a difference in the volume of the HD-570.  It's not horrible, but on one computer, I have to max out the volume just to get it loud enough.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Yep, the tonal balance is different, and the volume is lower", "unixReviewTime": 1089936000, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2004"}
