The sound quality and comfort are excellent, and the build quality is impressive: they are still in good shape after 12 years.  I replaced the earpads three or four years ago, and they are still basically like new.  In an age of stuff that breaks and fails and gets thrown away, I just wanted to stop in and pay my respects to Sennheiser for building something good that lasts for a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound and build quality", "unixReviewTime": 1353110400, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2012"}
