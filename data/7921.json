A while ago I bought a Sennheiser 570 for [some money], this one is a better choice.The headphone is huge but very light. It is tailored for \"symphony\" according to the description. Indeed when I use it to listen to classic music I do like its smooth sound. The treble is clear but it is a little dark in the low frequency.For vocals my Grado SR60 does a much better job than the HD570 by presenting a spacious and liquid image. But HD570 is doing fine for classic music due to the smoothness of its sound. If you like relaxed sound then you will like HD570 but if you like warm and openness in sound this probably is not your cup of tea.This cans is not very sensitive so you might need to have an amp to do it justice. Considering spending [money] for a brand new HD570, there really isn't too much to complain about.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "For [the money] this is not bad at all", "unixReviewTime": 1034726400, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2002"}
