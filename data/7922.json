I even have a headphone amp and took the earpads off to try and modify how it sounds. It really is too muddy sounding for my tastes. I don't understand why some people have reviewed it as having to much treble. I cant hardly hear any high frequencies and it only sounds somewhat decent if I use an equalizer. I do have to say though it is the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. It is a joy to be able to wear this for hours on end with out a break. Although it has been built with mostly plastic it doesn't creak like some very cheap headphones do. Too bad it just doesn't sound very good. The bass for me sounds ok but the mids and highs sound dead. Even all my cheap Sony headphones sound much better.For the sound I would give 0 stars but for the comfort of wearing them I'd give a 5. Because sound is more important for me I gave 2 stars overall. I'm not sure if you can even buy this model anymore.I have since moved on to Grado headphones and the sound from them is much much more pleasing.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Muddy sounding but super comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1324684800, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2011"}
