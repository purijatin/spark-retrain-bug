But to add real life into your music, especially out of the confines of the clasical genre, grab a pair of Sennheiser HD-600's...The sound those headphones create is near perfection.  They are often used as a reference for recording engineers, and audiophiles.  The extra [price] is very much worth it. ...these headphones are great for classical music, but if you are primarily a rock listner you might want to check out the Grado SR-325's.  I would also recommend going and auditioning this type of headphone before you buy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Close, but for this price, no cigar", "unixReviewTime": 970790400, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2000"}
