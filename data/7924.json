Sound quality is far superior, especially in the mids and highs.  Additional power is not required, although probably recommended.  The sound is bright and crisp, even out of my laptop sound card.  Comfort is wonderful, with virtually no strain after hours of use.  My only recommendation would be to improve the jack connector, but that is minor.  The HD590 is a solid headphone, with great sound and comfort.  It may be a little pricey for some, but if viewed as an investment, it can be well worth the sticker price.  If it wasn't for the somewhat high price, it would definitely get five start from me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid Listening Experience", "unixReviewTime": 983577600, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2001"}
