They did work, but did't last nearly as long as I'd expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries, we just weren't impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier. We ended up giving these away, along with the flashlight to my step-daughter when we upgraded the wife's flashlight to something with a little more punch.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Okay in our High Output LED Flashlight, but not Great", "unixReviewTime": 1355616000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2012"}
