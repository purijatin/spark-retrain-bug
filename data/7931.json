I could never imagine staring for hours at (or using the Graffiti interface on) a Palm, but I got the chance to test-drive a few of the PocketPCs, and the Jornada came out on top.It's not as bright and pretty as the Cassiopeia.  And you do have to tweak it hard and squint to see it in sunlight.  But books in Microsoft Reader are much more legible on its display, and the case design is terrific -- the flip-top case means not having to add a bulky case to the thing, and that, in turn, means I can put it in my pocket.  It's literally a PocketPC.Pocket Word works for writing, and not just short notes.  Pocket Streets has saved me on several occasions; Pocket Money has kept my finances neurotically straight; and I actually switched to Outlook so I could synchronize my schedule and email with the PocketPC, and it works great.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a PDA with more features than the Palm, especially if you want something you can stick in your pocket (great for those of us who don't like or don't carry a purse).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for writers on the go...", "unixReviewTime": 973209600, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2000"}
