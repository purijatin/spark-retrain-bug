It is much smaller than the Casio E-115, and the flip-up screen cover is great, but I am returning it.  HP has recently admitted the  device only displays 4,096 colors (12-bit) instead of the advertised 65,536  colors (16-bit).  Now I know why web page graphics seem a little off.  Also, the screen completely washes out in natural light, even on a cloudly  day outside.  I'm going to go with an iPaq instead.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product but the screen doesn't cut it", "unixReviewTime": 959212800, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2000"}
