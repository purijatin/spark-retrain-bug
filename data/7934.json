There's too much unnecessary stuff squeezed into this box.  That's obviously why it can't be the size of, say, the Palm V. I do not - in any way, shape or form - need  all this silly MP3 and audio stuff on an electronic organizer.  What, am I  going to plug in my earbud during a meeting?  How must Pearl Jam sound on a  Jornada?  I don't dare try. I'm taking the 545 back; I will continue using  my 430 (which I bought 4 months ago - thanks HP); and I will buy a new one  when they can slim it down by losing all the audio silliness. Give me an  electronic organizer with the Outlook features, the Omniserve calculator,  the Word and Excel viewers, and maybe a simple game, or two.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just give me an electronic organizer", "unixReviewTime": 957398400, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2000"}
