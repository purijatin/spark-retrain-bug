Doesn't have the nicest screen, but it's the only one I would take to war, and I mean it... I have two kids, 6&amp;3. I have dropped it, sat on it. You name it. It has the best price and the controls (wheel, snooze, screen off, record, etc.) are placed in the right places, except for playing games. But that's not what I bought it for. The cover is not pretty, but it will really protect the screen. I didn't even bother to buy a case. It will do okay inside a jean's pocket. I bought a 128 meg viking card and screen protectors. I am all set. Next buy will be a car charger so I can play wma's with no limit. Right now the 548 is the best buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost bullet proof!!", "unixReviewTime": 994809600, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2001"}
