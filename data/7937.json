First I will say what I like about it... then the bad stuff. -  The good: MSOFT and HP are almost there, this is much more palm-esque than their last try.  You can choose to  use an application manager that feels just like the palm's, and you can  even beam contacts cross-platform (to a palm).  Also, you can get a special  ethernet card for the 545 to plug it in to a LAN for all your networking  desires. (though I haven't done this yet)But don't be fooled by some of  the reviews below- many of these people work for HP and microsoft (trust  me, I just know this), and are using the reviews to generate positive spin  on this product. The 545 is still definitely slower than the palm, and  definitely much bigger (than the palm V).  Also, check any PDA shareware  site- There are so many more free or cheap programs for the palm, so for  the people who wrote that their palm couldn't &quot;do enough&quot;, they  must not have even tried.If you're looking for an mp3 player, do you  really want one that shares your PDA's operating system?  (The mp3 player  software uses almost all of the processor's capacity just to play music.)  Also, the color is really nice looking inside, but harder to see in bright  light.  I guess the bottom line is also the bottom line-  Competitively, I  see this as Palm's equal, but financially, you'll be taking a bigger hit.  (Eventually, when someone like GoType makes an external keyboard for the  545, it could be a decent surrogate laptop.)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "nice but not perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 957139200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2000"}
