I currently own a Palm VII and the Jornada kicks its butt in every area except wireless. Omnisky is supposed to be taking care of that very soon with the release of thier wireless modem for the  pocket PC. I have read a few reviews saying that the new OS crashes. I have  not seen it crash once in the week that I have had it and I have been using  it a lot. HP has a very well thought out design and feel to this device. I  highly recomend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Only had it a week and cant live without it.", "unixReviewTime": 960163200, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2000"}
