Kodak is the leader in film and this is a quality product.Based on recommendations from photographer friends, I take my film to a reputable processor and the pictures come out beautifully every time, a testament to the film and the developer.Of course, the higher priced Royal Gold is better but you get what you pay for...and Gold 400 does its job well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's where you have your film processed that counts!", "unixReviewTime": 1199491200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2008"}
