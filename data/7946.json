This cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function.  After getting used to it, you can make do.  The dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting.  Outdoors it is much worse and very difficult to read even on the outdoor setting.  Definitely avoid this one.  I want my money back!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Great idea, bad implementation", "unixReviewTime": 970444800, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2000"}
