After several attempts I found out how they should fit on my Jornada. I think HP, at least, should had spend some time writting a one page well done installation manual.Now that I installed the first screen protector, I used my Jornada for two weeks. What I got? an scratched screen protector. Now I feel like buying a protector for my screen protector.I used to have a Palm V protected with writeright protector stickers and I got used to them. I hope HP brings up something like this, or wait until Fellowes get to this market offering its expensive but high quality productsIf somebody find something better to protect your Jornada, please let me know", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Finally they fit, but...", "unixReviewTime": 981504000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2001"}
