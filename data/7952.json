After removing the film from both sides the hard plastic piece just snaps right in.  When the unit is on I don't see any screen quality degradation at all.  When the unit is off I do see minor scuffs and scratches quickly but that is what the protector is there for.  The size is almost perfect, maybe a fraction to small as it moves just a bit but not much.  I have not found that it makes writing recognition or dragging more difficult at all.  A very useful and necessary accessory to any 520 or 540 series Jornada.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Useful and Easy", "unixReviewTime": 992995200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2001"}
