The ups are obvious; protection from annoying scratches and of course much easier application than the off-brand sticky protectors, which are a huge pain in the ace to put on.  The only thing that really annoys me about them is the way they scratch so easily, but hey, wouldn't you rather a cheap piece of plastic be scratched than the unreplaceable screen.  That's right, unreplaceable.  HP cannot install new screens.  The only option is to buy a new one.  Also, the sensitivity is somewhat reduced in certain places, more specifically the corners.  If you want to take the risk, go for it, but if you want great protection, get these now.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Like a little (glove) for your screen", "unixReviewTime": 990144000, "reviewTime": "05 18, 2001"}
