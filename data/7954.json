The screen protectors that I got had the green film on both sides, but I only noticed the other side when my stylus peeled some of it off as I was writing, and the instructions(what instructions???) were VERY unclear. I didn't have the problem of slipping that other people seem to have had. The little plastic sheet stayed right where it was, and the screen seemed to remain sensitive, at least, to me. And yes, the display is difficult to see in outdoors, but that isn't anything new. You pay a pretty low amount for 6 pieces for plastic, which basically prevent your very-high-amount screen from being damaged. From that point of view, they are a definite bargain, and worth the small amount of extra cash.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent job...", "unixReviewTime": 981504000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2001"}
