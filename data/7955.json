I do find my stylus sliding a bit from time to time, but it seems as though there are some positions for the protector that will lock it into place better. I usually remind myself that I'd rather have accuracy problems than screen scratches. I do wish HP had included better instructions with the protectors - in any event, if you have a 540 series Jornada, they're a good investment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great accessory, poor instructions", "unixReviewTime": 975888000, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2000"}
