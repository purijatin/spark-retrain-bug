I personally own a 32 and 64 MB Rio 600. For the 32MB one, i get several people returning their rio 600's all the time. A few of those, their unit never worked at all, but to most they returned it about 2 months in use or more. I have had my Rio 600 32mb for 1 year and 3 months now, and it is still in great shape, and works like a charm. Why is this? It hasnt broke in 2 months because i have taken extremely good care of it. Most people's players die because they bend a small part in the hardware, such as in the batteries. So when i do anything with the batteries, i am EXTRA CAREFUL. Treat it like you are inserting batteries in a 2000 year old artifact that will crumble if you are the least bit rough on it. Don't try to insert the batteries in a hurry, either. Just be real careful, and try not to drop it. Also, be careful when insterting/taking out the usb cable and headphones also, to avoid bending anything.Player Pros/ConsPros:-Nice Appearance-Good Interface and fast connection speed-One battery thank god-Lasts long if you take good care of itCons:-32MB isnt enough, expensive expansion-Batteries dont last long and battery indicator is wrong-You have to take good care of itEnjoy", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "take good care of it", "unixReviewTime": 1039219200, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2002"}
