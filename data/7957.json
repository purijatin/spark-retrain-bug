And yes - Windows Media program is definately the transfer program to use. But it works FINE with Windows XP - it recognizes the Rio the second you plug it in. Downloads are fast and easy !The headphones do have to be replaced for extended listening. Try finding a decent set that ships with ANY portable out there. All of them need to be replaced.You can't beat the experience for the dollars invested ! Buy one - you'll be glad you did !", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rio is outstanding !", "unixReviewTime": 1023753600, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2002"}
