I wanted to take advantage of Skype calling my family. The mic itself is small, about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who don't know that a horse pill is any big a** pill you try to swallow...LOL I have a little pouch in my purse I keep it in so I don't lose it...because you will lose it. The sound was good when I recorded a voice memo. But you have to remove it to hear anything back. THAT's the kicker!It's a restriction of the device, not the mic. I thought I could use the mic to speak and my Bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time. No such luck. You have to get the iPod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that. So all I can use this for is to record stuff and listen later. But it was cheap, so it's still a cool addition to my toys. Oh, and I also got the iPod headphones with mic... those too live in my little pouch of goodies...LOL", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pretty darn cool mic for iPod 2G", "unixReviewTime": 1316736000, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2011"}
