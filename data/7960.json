If you MUST own a RIO get a 500 atleast you can use smart media cards.  Its bad enough that the 600 uses a RIO only method for expanding storage, but the design of such is bad.  They had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery.  The pins are very easily bent or broken when reloading batteries or upgrading the back panel.  The device is physically larger than it should be, and it is made of the WORST plastic possible.  A soft compound that would not be durable.  OVERALL BAD PRODUCT.  PLEASE SHOP AROUND.  AND CHECK OUT REVIEWS.  DIAMOND gets what they deserve for letting this peice of junk make it all the way to market.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor design. Too big, Too Loose, Too bad...", "unixReviewTime": 977702400, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2000"}
