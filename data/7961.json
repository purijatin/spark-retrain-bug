It's perfect not only for music, but also for any hobby that involves sound! For one great price you can get yourself an easily customizeable, greatly dynamic bird song system / language training system / etc. that doubles as a portable jukebox!I love the Rio 600 - I have 2 of them - and they're super easy to load music on and off of. Just rip your favorite CDs, rearrange them into your own personal play sets, and load them onto the Rio. Want to learn a new language? Load up a set of phrases. Going birdwatching at the beach? Stick 20 beach bird songs on there, and there's plenty of room left for some music too!The Rio has been very sturdy for me - we've dragged them everywhere, dropped them, thrown them, and it keeps on running strong.Highly, highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I have two that I use *constantly*", "unixReviewTime": 1024358400, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2002"}
