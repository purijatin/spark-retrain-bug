Overall, it's a great mp3 player, and one of the cheaper ones out there (too bad it hasn't gone done in price at all it seems :(.It's compact, cool-looking, and durable (I accidentally dropped it over a 3 story balcony and it still works!).  Beyond all the technical expandability stuff, I think the software is pretty good.  It transfers the 32mb within 5 minutes on my computer (AMD-K6 400 with 64mb RAM only ;).  Also, the software converts my cds into a more compact mp3 format than other programs I've used (but I don't really fiddle with the settings in them), and it sounds great.  As a college studend and an athelete, I really appreciate how these mp3 players don't skip a beat (I've taken it on all our trips)!Some cons I've seen... well 32mb stores at most 1 hour of music, which is fine for me since I can listen to my music over and over again, but depends on your tolerance.  I sometimes carry my CD player around just in case I get a craving for something else, but comparatively, the Rio is much easier to have around.  Also, I don't change the music on it much, since I don't have access to my computer much (sometimes I don't go home for days), but again it depends on your situation.  Otherwise, if you have some extra cash and easy access to your computer, I'd highly recommend the Rio 600.  It's worked well for me so far.Oh, one more thing... I find that wrapping the earphone cords with it still attached will eventually expose some wires at connection (strain and stress and all that), so I take out the cord before I wrap it now... no biggy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Haven't had a problem so far :)", "unixReviewTime": 995846400, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2001"}
