It sounds great, the backlighting is cool,  and the USB connection is really fast. (I loaded up about 8 songs at CD  quality in about a minute).BUT, the headphones are INSANE -- small and  irritating to put on, and tinny sounding.  The 32 MB is WAY too small, and  the main play button is really poorly designed -- sometimes I push the  right button, other times I don't -- it's almost arbitrary. Also, the lack  of a belt clip was an extreme oversight -- I don't want to have to hold  this thing while I'm on the treadmill!When the 800 ships with 64 MB, and  you replace the headphones with something normal, I'd recommend this  player. For the Mac, it's about the only option.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Cool but Not Quite There", "unixReviewTime": 968803200, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2000"}
