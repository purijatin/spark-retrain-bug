Jarvi \"pj6000\"", "helpful": [9, 10], "reviewtext": "I read a lot of other reviews before deciding to ask for the rio 600 for christmas. This is the first portable mp3 player I've gotten and I honestly love it. The 32 megs it comes with may not seem like much, but by recording music in the windows WMA file format I've been able to fit over 16 3-5 minute songs in it, and the reason for getting something like the rio instead of a cd/mp3 player is so that you don't have to worry about scratched discs &amp; skipping.  This is definitely the best player for it's price range.Just to inform you of the facts about some things other reviewers have said:1.)The software upgrade purchase simply gives you the ability to burn cd's with the Real Audio Manager program, but if you have a cd burner then chances are you already have cd-burning software, so you don't need to get the upgrade.2.)The problems many people have had with the software not finding the Rio is simply a matter of 1 setting in the options menu. By default it is set to autodetect what player is connected to your pc, that setting doesn't work, so all you do is set it to look specificaly for the Rio 600 instead of autodetect and it will work just fine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Love It!", "unixReviewTime": 977788800, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2000"}
