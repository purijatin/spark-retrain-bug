Mok", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewtext": "Just bought this little player from Amazon.com in an unbeatable price...I like its good workmanship, stylish and most important...high  qualily sound! The case fit nice and tight with a belt clip on the back. It is cushioned to protect it from dropping accidentally.Installing the software is easy and when you register it online you can upgrade to a new BASIC version for FREE.The only thing I don't like is it uses it's own back pack memory.... that means high price tag. It would be perfect if it takes smartmedia card.One more thing I don't like is the ear phone. My ears hurt after wearing them for awhile.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty, sexy and stylish MP3 player", "unixReviewTime": 1019260800, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2002"}
