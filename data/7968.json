I was not looking for a place to store my complete music collection, just something to use while waiting at the barber shop, doctor, oil change etc.  This works perfectly.If you upgrade to the latest version of Windows Media Player you can interface directly with this unit and not have to be bothered with additional software.  Using the WMA format it sounds just fine.It is not easily expanded, but if that is what you are after get a mini-disc so that expansion is as simple as buying additional, low cost, discs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "You get what you get and you dont throw a fit.", "unixReviewTime": 1043280000, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2003"}
