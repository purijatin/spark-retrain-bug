I use it for my Bug Zapper, it lays nice and flat and disappears into the grass, so it can be walked over and not a trip hazard.  Even has survived a few dog bits from my 2 puppies.  And it didn't pierce all the way through, so it's still good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Wire", "unixReviewTime": 1316217600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2011"}
