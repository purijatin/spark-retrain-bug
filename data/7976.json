The green color blended in better but the new cord is very stiff and won't lie flat on the ground, at least not in the cold temperatures we have in winter here. So now the cord is more visible than the orange one since it loops up a few inches above the ground.  We got 3 inches of snow, which would have completely covered the orange cord but not the green one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good heavy duty outdoor extension cord.", "unixReviewTime": 1388534400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014"}
