Trust me there are a lot of posers with high ticket prices out on the store shelves. These low grade cords pop up on the radar especially during the holidays. For me, these Coleman Cable 40 foot 16/3 extension cords has proven to be a winner. I especially like the heavy duty molding on both the plugs and connectors. After over twelve months continuous duty in both our front and back yards, the vinyl covering has maintained its color very well. Unlike the light weights out there, I've found absolutely no peeling or breeches in the seal. That says it all for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Durable", "unixReviewTime": 1350432000, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2012"}
