This one is still longer than I wanted, but cheaper ones were more expensive.  This is your basic outdoor 16 Gauge, 3 conductor extension cord, but what more do you need?  This will not handle outdoor equipment like mowers or weed whackers, but it is perfect for holiday decorations (and being white, it will hide in the snow... that could be good or bad).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple cheap extension cord", "unixReviewTime": 1319155200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2011"}
