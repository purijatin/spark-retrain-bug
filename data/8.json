This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A nice easy to use accessory.", "unixReviewTime": 1405036800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014"}
