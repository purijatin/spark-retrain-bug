I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Identical to RapCap", "unixReviewTime": 1270684800, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2010"}
