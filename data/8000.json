The white jacket on this cord is thick enough not to show the cable braid through it and yet is still very flexible.Many of the 35 foot or so long $15 or so versions of this cord found in many department stores by comparison have a jacket thin enough you can see the edges of the wire braid underneath.  One is not necessarily any better than the other, however, I prefer the look of the thicker jacket.SUGGESTIONS:--------------If you are looking to hook up a high amperage device like a dehumidifier or other equipment that usually have big surges upon starting up or at the start of operation cycles, you might consider heavier gauge wire like 14 or 12.  For example, a dehumidifier rated at 7A that averages 5A load may generate a brief 25A load at start-up and each time it comes back on to keep humidity level.If you are looking for WHITE OUTDOOR HEAVY GAUGE extension cord, here's one I found:Milspec Direct 15-Foot 12-Gauge SJTW Hospitality & Special Events Extension Cord, White.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Thick jacket but still flexible", "unixReviewTime": 1361145600, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2013"}
