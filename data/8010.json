I was expecting the cord to heat up & short out. It has not done that. I live in a really old house & the circuit breakers kept flipping off when I was using this heater in my room.The plus ins are far & few between & almost all the circuits are on the same breaker. I placed this cord across my room out the door & plugged it into a completely different circuit. It has been working great for me.I like the white cause I can see if there is any electrical shorts if they occur in the cord. It is nice & thick & has been holding up just great.The price was really good for my budget. Great buy !", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great buy.", "unixReviewTime": 1364688000, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2013"}
