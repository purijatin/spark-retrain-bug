The last cord I have had for some years and do not know the manufacturer, but it was orange, and stayed very pliable - the same as room temp - in any ambient temps.  This coleman cable does serve it's purpose - it works as an extension cord - but when I had it running across the driveway for a few days last week in cold winter temps (10-15F), I was unable to coil it very easily, it was pretty much frozen stiff.  Hope that info helps someone, other than the cold stiffness issue, it's a perfectly good cord.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent cord for the price...but gets stiff in cold weather", "unixReviewTime": 1360800000, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2013"}
