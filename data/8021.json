Rael", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I of course would not recommend my situation if you were attaching a lot of devices to the APC Power outlet strip, but since I have so few devices, I am not worried about using essentially a 15 amp to 20 amp adapter plug.  I checked my local home improvement store before purchasing this but was not able to find it.  I went back to my home improvement store and found one later, but I believe it might have been priced a little more at my local home improvement store.The quality of the cable is very good, so if you need something to adapt the 20 amp only plug to a 15 amp only receptacle, I highly recommend this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for connecting my APC Power outlet strip (20 amp plugs) to my 15 amp wall socket", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2013"}
