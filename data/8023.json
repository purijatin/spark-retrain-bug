They can make a 'cheap' DVD recorder, so why can't they make a 'cheap' AND good CD Recorder?  I'm still waiting.COOLING ISSUE: Anyhow, what I did to my unit work better was to take off the cover, drill enough holes in the cover to make it look like Swiss cheese, then add a small computer fan inside the case to blow towards the CDR inside.  I run the fan off of a small 'wall wart' AC adapter.  It has worked okay since then, UNITL the time that I didn't plug-in my (noisy) internal fan, and sure enough, it locked-up.  So, I'm ASSUMING that there is a heating / lack of COOLING issue with these units, unless somebody can tell me something else.  Obviously, unplug the unit from the AC mains before you take the cover off, make sure all metal burrs are cleaned from the cover, and securely mount the little cooling fan inside.  Make sure you have a rubber grommet or electrical tape to protect the DC wire from the AC adapter to prevent a short where it passes into the case.  Put it back together and see if it works.  Please report back here if you try adding a fan to yours, and how it worked for you.  No warranty expressed or implied, and your mileage may vary.  No responsbile for 'boat anchors' if you break something while putting in your little fan/cooling units.I have noticed no difference between the 74 and 80 minute disks.  Good luck; I sure wish Philips would make a new and improved working unit like this, with proper cooling hardware!!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "COOLING PROBLEMS - How to fix it?; plus, It's Nice When It Works", "unixReviewTime": 1187136000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2007"}
