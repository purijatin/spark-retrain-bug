The CDR775BK is a good unit. Unfortunately, you have to use 74-minute CD-R discs. 80-minute CD-R discs generally will not work. Once you read the manual and do some experimenting most of the other misconceptions about this exceptional unit should be cleared up. The unit has dual record and play trays so it is quite simple to make CD copies. It is important to note that if you wish to make copies from vinyl recordings your turntable must have a built-in pre-amplifier and you must patch this into the analog inputs otherwise, you will get very little signal strength and it will be virtually inaudible. My friend had that problem very problem. I had him use the phono-input (phono-inputs pre-amplify the signal from the turntable) to his receiver and then send the signal from the record-out on the back of the receiver into the analog inputs of the CDR775BK. That worked. You can also get a phono pre-amplifer and accomplish the same end. All in all this is a very good unit but you really have to read the manual.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Read, Experiment, Learn", "unixReviewTime": 1025049600, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2002"}
