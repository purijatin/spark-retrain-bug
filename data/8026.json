I love the ability to  record CDs, but I think maybe I should have shopped around for a better  product.My biggest complaint with Philips is that their support is  awful.  They have idoits with no training answering the phones.  You can  actually hear them reading through the same notes you can find on the web.  Call with a complex problem and they ask dumb questions like &quot;are your  cables plugged in?&quot;My second complaint is that with fast dubbing,  the deck adds a half second of blank time between tracks.  Therefore, don't  bother copying a continuous play CD.  They sound really bad.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Fun Product:  Just Pray It Doesn't Break", "unixReviewTime": 965347200, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2000"}
