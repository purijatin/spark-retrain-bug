After reading many of the comments of the people on here, I am amazed that CD recorders are so popular.  Aside from the complaints about the many things that go wrong with this model, I'm surprised about the comments that show up about how CD recording works even if it works right.  For example, one person said, \"I hit the finalize button.  It normally takes a little over two minutes to complete this function.\"  Amazing! (Negatively so.)  Or another, \"There are a few steps that if you mess up on any one of them, you accidentally record on the wrong tracks.\"  I recommend to those of you who like to make mixes of your favorite songs off of CD, record, and/or tape, to get a Minidisc recorder!  I have one by Sony--Amazon.com sells the [price] model (MDSJE-440); I have a similar model.  I LOVE THIS THING! Recording is a piece of cake.  And screw-ups are no problem.  Tracks can be moved, divided, combined, and erased...at ANY time!  During your recording session, days or weeks later, and all with great ease.  And it's digital quality recording (direct digital from CDs).  So don't mess with wasted CD-Rs that one mistake and they're toast, or even the inconveniences of CD-RW recording; for only [price] you can get a quality Sony Minidisc recorder, and Minidiscs are pretty cheap too. PLUS you can record up to FIVE HOURS on a Minidisc--try doing that on a CD-R!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "I suggest you try Minidisc!", "unixReviewTime": 1025222400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2002"}
