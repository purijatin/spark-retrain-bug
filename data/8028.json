LPs to cd and this recorder is perfect for the job. It's reasonably easy to use and I was recording from an external source (a turntable) within a half hour of setup. Although I hear some inevitable noise between tracks on the vinyl, that's inevitable due to the age of the originals; the fidelity of the sound tracks themselves is wonderful and sometimes it seems even better than the original.It's also easy to copy directly from other CDs and can fast copy a complete CD, for archival purposes of course, in double time.For the discerning audiophile, this is a worthwhile purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent reproduction at an affordable price", "unixReviewTime": 1018569600, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2002"}
