The microphone that we received is actually white but that is not an issue for us. We put it on our 5-6 year old I-pod touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games.  Despite reviews that stated it didn't work because the I-pod thinks there are headphones in, we have not had that issue with any of our talking games  with the exception of the talking Angela game.  I put the mic in and rebooted the I-pod and it worked perfectly.  I thought perhaps I would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either.  I was actually ready to take my I-pod to the Apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this $3.00 dollar microphone was the answer for us.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Updated our older I-pod touch", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013"}
