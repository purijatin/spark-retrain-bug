I purchased mine in 2000 as a factory refurbished unit, and have burned 10`s of mix cd`s on Sony, Maxell, Fugi, and other brands with no problems whatsoever.  Use ONLY \"music\" or \"audio\" cd`s for recording. You`ll be surprised how many people try using standard CD-R, or CD-RW to save a few pennies, and then condemn the unit when it doesn`t work!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Never a single problem", "unixReviewTime": 1149120000, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2006"}
