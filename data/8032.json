I went through 3 different units and they all had the same problems!  Read some of the other reviews for the list of problems; I've encountered most of them.  I can't stress how bad their burners are!  What a headache having to send it out just to come back with the same problems...on 3 different units none the less!  I finally demanded my money back from Circuit City (who I wouldn't recommend either) and went with the Pioneer 839 from Tweeter (who are light years better than CC) and have been very happy with it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Nothing but problems", "unixReviewTime": 1086912000, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2004"}
