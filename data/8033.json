I had mine for only a few months before it simply stopped recording on CDR's I'd been using all along.  So it had to be shipped back to the factory (where it stayed for 5 weeks!), so they could \"look at it.\" Over a month later, I got a call from them saying that \"Philips CD recorders are only designed to work with Philips exclusive CDR blank media.\"  My first problem with this is that apparently nobody who sells Philips recorders knows this--or they just don't tell you-- and Philips consumer electronics, themselves, don't tell you in the instructions, on the box, or even at their helpline 1-800 number.  Secondly, good luck trying to find any Philips brand CDR blank media out there, much less at a reasonable price.  And even when the unit is functioning the way it should, the record times are sporadic and the computer inside the unit is fickle at best.  Please use my unfortunate experiences with these CD recorders to your own benefit.  Do not spend your hard-earned money on this product.  I'm sure there are other quality CD recorders out there, but I just blew my money on the wrong one.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't waste your money on this.", "unixReviewTime": 1011744000, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2002"}
