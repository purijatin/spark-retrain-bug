I still consider the camera as a good buy for the money. The resolution is quite enough for me. (Actually, I can't understand the present race for megapixels. In my opinion, unless you are a professional photographer, you never need more than 1600x1200.) However, the picture quality is not adequate. It would be enough for 640x480, but for higher resolution you see a lack of contrast, sharpness and saturation even for good light conditions. I guess that the optic is just poor. Anyway, if you need a camera not only for publishing pictures online or emailing them to friends and relatives, you'd better spend more money and buy something better.Also the battery life is too short. You should always switch off the batteries if not using the camera a day or more (instead of removing them I insert an old Post-It plastic flag under the lid to open the circuit.)The provided software is really ridiculous. Fortunately, all you actually need is just a TWAIN driver to transfer images from the camera to your favourite software. You can specify this during installation.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "picture quality is not adequate", "unixReviewTime": 991785600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2001"}
