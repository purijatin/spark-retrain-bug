Good pictures.  Works well in low light without a flash - much better than my Cannon Elph APS camera.  I used the AC adapter only to learn the features.  After that, I put in rechargeable NiMH 1600mAh batteries.  I took about 20 pictures so far (all using LCD) and used the batteries while trasfering pictures to the PC, and so far the battery indicator shows half strength.I have Win 98 and USB.  Instead of software that comes with the camera, I am using Windows Imaging and Adobe PhotoDeluxe with updated drivers for PDC-1300 from ..., which claims to work with Win 98, 2000 and XP Home Edititon.  So, those having problems with 2000 and XP should check it out.  The drivers are very good, and transfer goes very fast.I really liked the video-out feature.  This alows you to view your pictures on TV using TV's video-in jack.  If you put the camera in the recording mode while connected to the TV, it works like a video monitor.  Hypothetically, one could get a very long cable (or wireless signal transmitter/receiver) and use the camera as a video monitor, say, in baby room.Finally, unlike many other cameras with video-out feature, PDC-1100 can be switched from NTSC video signal (used in U.S. TV sets) to PAL video signal (used, for example, in many European TV sets).  You can view your pictures on your hotel TV during your next \"European Vacation.\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good camera", "unixReviewTime": 1010188800, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2002"}
