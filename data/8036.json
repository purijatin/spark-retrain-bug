Overjoyed indeed. Thought I'd get the Olympus 360L, but glad I  didn't.I use an iMac and bought a Lexar 32mb Compact Flash card and  enclosed reader. No problems! Additionally, Virtual PC v3 also loads  Windows 98 PDC programs and I can download and photo-edit with W-98  software also. Friends with higher-end cameras are amazed.I have  absolutely NO complaints at all, and am totally satisfied. (Sounds as tho I  work for Polaroid, but I'm retired from a different field).  Just a GREAT  product and I'm puzzled as to why the camera hasn't received more media  acclaim/notice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SUPER!!!
