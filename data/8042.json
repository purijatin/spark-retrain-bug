I take one with me when I go to raves,  'cause I don't want to lose my more expensive camera.  Photo quality is  quite reasonable.  The camera is loaded with fast film, so it works in all  light conditions with help from the flash.  Might as well activate the  flash for every picture, since it makes outdoor pictures look better, too.  Plus, when you consider you're throwing away the camera, there's no point  in trying to save battery power.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for raves, parties, camping", "unixReviewTime": 965952000, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2000"}
