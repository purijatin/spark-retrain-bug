Tough luck. But there's a place selling Kodak disposable cameras right around the corner. You wonder to yourself if it's worth it to pick one up.For only $8 or so, this is a good pickup. While this isn't a 5.1 megapixel digital camera, it will still take good photos. Having a flash is an added bonus. It's also compact enough to fit in most pairs of pants. There's nothing special about these cameras--no zoom or panoramic prints--but they are easy to use.While it's still cheaper to use your own camera, the convenience is worth it in many cases.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Even in today's digital world, there's still a niche", "unixReviewTime": 1114905600, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2005"}
