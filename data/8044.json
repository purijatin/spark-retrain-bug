Just plug them into the back of your PC.I've had the same speakers for at least ten years. I used them with the first MYST game, so figure how long ago that was. Every time I get a new PC these speakers get used and the new speakers go into the closet. The Labtec's are dented and banged up, scratched and dinged, but I won't trade them for anything. They've got the best sound around. I don't have to crank the volume button to its highest setting just to hear something.They do take up some space on my PC desk, but it's worth it. The wider apart you place them, the greater the stereo sound.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THE BEST", "unixReviewTime": 1223596800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2008"}
