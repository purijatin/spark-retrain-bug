They are not to large, but provide excellent sound. The AC adapter block is considerably small, a surprise for multimedia speakers. Headphone jack is convenient too. Bass, mid-range, and highs are all good. Don't be fooled by the 2 watt rating - they sound like 10 watts or more! They are definitely worth it for any user who needs a simple two-speaker system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sound like much more expensive speakers!", "unixReviewTime": 992217600, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2001"}
