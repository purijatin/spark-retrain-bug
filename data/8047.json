They don't give any nasty, cheap vibrating sound that other low-priced speakers give. The speakers are also not ugly as other inexpensive ones are. The color of these speakers match most keyboards (a perfect match with microsoft keyboards and very close to logitech) as well as monitors. They possess a very simple volume and power control and you can plug in an earphone/headset directly into them. If you could dish out some extra cash and need a lot more power, I would recommend the cambridge pc works speakers. However, I listen to music on these all the time and these labtec speakers still sound great. I hope you find your perfect speakers!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Speakers for Price Range", "unixReviewTime": 1014854400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2002"}
