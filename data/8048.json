I don't listen to much music on my speakers, only system sounds and my computer games mostly, and they perfectly suit my needs.The speakers are weak (not clearly audible) in the extended upper and lower regions.  They're pretty powerful for their size, and I've been happy with their range of sound for most of my needs.  If I were going to listen to CDs on my computer a lot, I'd pay the little extra for the next series up by Labtec.The plugs for headphones and microphone at the front of the left speaker have come in handy for me.  It's a nice bonus.If you're looking for inexpensive powered speakers, these are a great buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 997747200, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2001"}
