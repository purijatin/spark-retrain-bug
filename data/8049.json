For the size and the age, they've got surprisingly good sound. They're a good,inexpensive upgrade from non-powered to powered speakers, but they won't substitute for a good sound system to music and movie connoisseurs. For the price and durability you can't beat them. Great for a kid's room or for that secondary PC you don't use that often. Or, buy them to get you through until you can get a good sound system... you may find yourself using them a lot longer than you had anticipated.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Surprisingly good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1239926400, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2009"}
