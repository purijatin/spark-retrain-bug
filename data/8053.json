It is great technology.  Here's what I like best:  1. a 340Mb card INCLUDED - this is good for about 250 pictures, equivalent to over 10 rolls of film!  2. Picture quality is superb.  3. It has the most powerful flash for an automatic camera that I have ever seen.  Also, the red eye reduction mode really works.  4. It has 5 or 6 different automatic settings that work extremely well (portrait, landscape, panorama, night, etc.).  The night mode work surprisingly well.  5.  The 30 second video (quicktime format) is great.  There is no sound but for capturing a quick movie it comes in handy.  6.  The camera is very easy to use.  Simple menu system.  I read the manual and tested for about 20 minutes.  That was it.The industry pubs loved it.  The only knock on it was the battery life.  It takes 4 AA batteries and sucks the life out of them rather quickly (30 to 40 pictures).  However, they should have used the Olympus rechargeable AA batteries.  They are awesome.  They lasted 3 days and well over 120 shots and many movie shots in Disney.  This included replaying it all from the camera on the TV each night.  If I didn't do that, they would last the full hard drive on a single charge.  I recommend those batteries.  I carry an extra set of regular AA's just in case.  The fact that you can buy AA's anywhere if you should run out of life is another plus.Overall, I love this camera.  Its a little large (can't fit in your shirt pocket), but light.  Make sure you get the AC adapter.  Incredibly, its not included.  I still have to get one.  Its good to use when connected to a TV or downloading to your computer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Look no further", "unixReviewTime": 978480000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2001"}
