There's little to complain about in this camera and much to love. I love:* The stunning image quality.*  The IBM MicroDrive. I didn't want to have to worry about downloading images  while on a trip, and with its 245-picture storage (at the highest  resolution), the Casio solves this for me. Given the MicroDrive's hefty  price tag, its inclusion makes the camera very good value. It even slips  into my Win CE handheld computer and does double duty there.* The choice  between full automatic and manual control.* The panorama and movie  modes.* The look and the feel. It's not an ultra-light, but it's no  heavyweight and it looks handsome. The design is somewhat right-handed, but  even as a leftie I found it comfortable to use, holding it in my right hand  while adjusting menu controls with my left. Now, I'd just like to know how  you avoid smudging the display screen when using the viewfinder! (A problem  I'm sure many digicams share.)* The good documentation. It'd be nice if  it had an index, but it's well written.What I don't like:* The lack  of inclusion of an AC adapter. Save yourself time and order one when you  order your camera. I've found battery life not too bad using NiMH  rechargeables, but the AC adapter makes all the difference when downloading  images and when you're just playing about learning how to use the  camera.* The off-centre tripod mount.* The lack of an 800x600  resolution mode.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 956188800, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2000"}
