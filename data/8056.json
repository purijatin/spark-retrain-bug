Newman", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I bought this camera, and had troubles like everyone else in getting it to work with Windows 2000 via usb.  I also have a RC1 of Windows XP and good news for all.  You don't even need to install the Casio USB driver.  Windows XP will detect the camera and download the pictures for you.  One caveat however, is that the way that casio stores your pictures (the origional picture, plus a low-res copy for the preview screen), will cause windows XP to download both of these images giving you a high-res version of your picture and a low-res version.  But you can also choose to just open the folder that holds the pictures on the camera itself and get the good pics that way.All in all, great camera compared to most others.  My main problem with most other cameras is the storage, and the casio is one of the best priced cameras to overcome this with the IBM 340 drive.  It holds a to (~200) of absaloutly beautiful and HUGE pics.I would recommend this camera to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works well with Windows XP", "unixReviewTime": 996105600, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2001"}
