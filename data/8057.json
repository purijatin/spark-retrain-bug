The Microdrive saves you from ever having a problem with disk space (250 high res pics). So you can take pictures non-stop and not worry. It was easy to  load the pics to my PC with the USB adapter and the software was pretty  easy to use. Also, it includes a video adapter so you can play the pictures  in a slideshow on a TV one minute after taking your picture(s). There are  internet services for printing your pictures (mailed to you on high quality  paper) and I could e-mail and post the pics to a free web site...so it was  easy for us to share our news the same day.The other great thing about  digital cameras is that you can preview the pic right away, so you know if  you need to retake the picture...really important on my daughters first day  of life.The only downside is that this  camera , like all digital cameras, eats up batteries at a ridiculous pace.  I went through 20 AA batteries in a week! I recommend buying 8 rechargeable  AA batteries...the camera only needs 4,but an extra 4 keeps you going.  (Good luck trying to buy the AC Adapter anywhere). 8 rechrgeable batts will  run you about $40 with the charger, but you'll spend more than that on  batteries anyway...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for new parents!", "unixReviewTime": 964828800, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2000"}
