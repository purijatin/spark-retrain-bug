The detail of sound and clarity you get is unmatched, Sennheiser is a great brand and as with everything if you take care of them they will be with you for quite some time. Really happy with this purchase", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1393891200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014"}
