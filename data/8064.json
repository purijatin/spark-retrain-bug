I saw so many positive reviews of theses headphones and got such a sweet deal on Amazon that I just had to try them. They are comfortable in the extreme. And the sound is rich and very satisfying for hours on end. For the first time, I find that I am satisfied to listen to headphones instead of my speakers.  They are open backed, so when my wife is clunking around in the kitchen I have to switch to my closed backed Beyerdynamics. Otherwise, these get the nod.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best set of 'phones I've ever owned.", "unixReviewTime": 1387411200, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2013"}
