I wanted a good headphone to go with my Rotel RX-1050 receiver/amplifier because it reproduces sound so beautifully. In the Sennheiser 600s I got what I wanted and then some. They are a sheer listening pleasure. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do not work well with a portable CD player and would need an amp to perform properly. They are execellent with a good home stereo but they do let you hear exactly what is on your source, so with lower quality equipment, they will sound only as good as your stuff (garbage in, garbage out -- don't blame the 600s). These earphones are the best I have ever listened to. They are a joy to use. They fit reasonably comfortably but could get warm with prolonged use. Overall they are an excellent addition to any audiophile's equipment.  My only (minor) gripe is the rather flimsy cable that comes standard.  I am thinking of purchasing the Equinox cable (which has gotten excellent reviews) or making my own custom cable to further enchance the sound of these wonderful cans.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A quantum leap in listening pleasure", "unixReviewTime": 1035072000, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2002"}
