They sound great even on the basic output of my Sony SCD-555ES SACD changer.  But they really come alive with the Little Dot Mk III tube amp. The highs are so clean and the mids are liquid.  Bass is deep and proper but not exaggerated like on some of the Bose and other products.  Don't expect a lot of volume out of your Ipod or computer.  You need a headphone amp or at least a real headphone jack like on a receiver or preamp.  Sometimes I hear words sung by inarticulate singers that I realize I had previously misunderstood.  Certainly if you have a song where you can't tell what is being sung these headphones can help with that.  I've had these since either 2002 or 2003.  Nothing else I've heard compares.  But in context, I've not heard the newer 650, 700, or 800.  They sound so good that I'm not looking.  They are comfortable to wear for at least an hour.  I never listen longer than that to protect my hearing.
