I had heard many wonderful things about these headphones over the years and was eager to try them. I was using Audio-Technica ATH-A900 for 7 years before I bought the HD 600. I haven't used the A900 a single time since I received the Sennheisers. The first thing I noticed was how huge they sounded compared to my old headphones. There were times I would say, &#34;What the heck was that?&#34; turning my head thinking something on the other end of the room was making noise, but it was just part of the music coming from the speaker an inch away from my ear. Everything I've played through them has sounded wonderful. I have used them daily for over two years, and there is barely any sign of wear. They are pretty comfortable. I have no issues wearing them for eight or more hours a day. I sometimes forget they are even on. Very happy with them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sennheiser HD 600", "unixReviewTime": 1388275200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2013"}
