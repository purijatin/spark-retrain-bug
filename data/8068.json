Not only are they built to last, but if something does break, you can replace it.  For example, my devil-cat bit through the cord a few weeks ago, so I ordered a replacement cord(Silver Dragon) that can be installed by anyone in a few minutes.  Needless to say, the sound is incredible, and the pads are so soft that I can wear them for hours at a time.  There are many replacement accessories for audiophiles, so the sky's the limit.  The marble-swirl finish on the outside is also a nice touch.  If you wear headphones a lot, you really owe it to yourself to get the best!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worth every penny", "unixReviewTime": 1108080000, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2005"}
