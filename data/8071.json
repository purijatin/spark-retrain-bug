After \"repair,\" the phones exhibit the same problem.  I will contact Sennheiser again because I think it's unacceptable for $400 headphones to have this problem.UPDATE:  I decided that the creaking was intolerable.  I tried to make a return through Amazon, but that window had closed.  So now I have initiated a repair at Sennheiser, as I think there is a manufacturing defect.  Very disappointing.When I looked more closely at the problem, I saw that most of the noise comes from the two joints where the earpads meet the headband.  Those joints are designed to rotate slightly.  The rotation should be smooth (as it is on my HD580s), but in this case there are about 12 little hiccups in the rotation on each side.  The joints are grinding, and each stutter in the rotation translates as a creak.INITIAL REVIEW:  I have been using the HD600 for a few weeks, and am disappointed to find them more than a little annoying, unlike my HD580 pair.  First, they seem too tight & press too hard around my ears.  I have tried bending them wide open (carefully), but that hasn't improved how they feel.  Second, there is a lot of structural noise conveyed into my head through my bones -- noise from the ear pads and from the headband.  If I yawn with them on, there's a little cascade of noise. If I move my head at all, there is noise.  The tight fit may be exacerbating this.  I am wondering if different ear pads would improve the situation.  Maybe memory foam?  I don't recall that other people reported this problem, so I'm surprised by it.  It is really distracting, and it's not what I expect from a $400 set of headphones.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Lots of creaking noise (& the fit is a bit uncomfortable)", "unixReviewTime": 1379721600, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2013"}
