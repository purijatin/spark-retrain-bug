The construction is very important. Why?  Because you inevitably throw them around in various ways.  You cannot be careful all the time.  And you may not be the only one who uses the headphone.  They inevitably fall down, or the cleaning lady does something.  This headphone has one of the most fragile holder pieces for the earpieces that I have seen.  Look closely at the construction, and notice the plastic U shaped holder that actually holds the ear piece.  It is very fragile.  If you break the holder, you can try super glue to repair, but that tends to be temporary.  Other fine headphones use metal, or Grado has an alternative design.  When my holder piece broke, the company charged me $150 to repair this vital item, which is so fragile and which does not lend itself to easy repair.  That is why I rate the headphone down.  The basic design has not changed in many years, and it surely needs to be upgraded.  Perhaps with a poor review the company will get the message.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor Construction mars very good headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1366588800, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2013"}
