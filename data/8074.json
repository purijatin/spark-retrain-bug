Lauterbach \"chadl2\"", "helpful": [158, 174], "reviewtext": "This is the best dynamic headphone in the world, and is rivalved only by the Grado RS-1 headphone.  Many studio engineers and audiophile's use these as their REFERENCE headphone...they are a steal for such a high quality headphone.  The Grado RS-1 [costs more], and is definately less comfortable than the Sennheisers.  These headphones have an extremely detailed, open, airy sound, that nears electrostatic sound.  They are also unique in that they suit all types of music very well, they have great punch for rock music, but can perform clasical pieces with all the fullness and detail they were designed.It should be noted these headphone have an impedance of 300 ohms.  Most headphone are 16-32 ohms.  What this means is to get the full potential out of them you will need some type of amplifier.  Headphone.com offers a couple inexpensive sollutions to this problem, as does audioadvisor.com.  Althought they are not true audiophile components, they will greatly enhance your experience with these headphones.  If you are planning on travelling with them, you can almost bet you won't be content with their sound when powered only by a portable CD player.  I use a Audio Valve RKV Mark II Headphone Amplifier at home, and the headphone.com Airhead on the road.  Buy these headphones if you are looking for true audiophile sound, or just the best dynamic headphone, but be aware of their limitations without am amplifier.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Dynamic Headphone in the World", "unixReviewTime": 970704000, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2000"}
