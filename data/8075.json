Hinton", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I have had these for 7 months and have used them a lot.I am pretty critical when expensive and much hyped products fail to deliver but I have nothing but praise for these headphones and the hype is well deserved.Music is mostly Apple lossless or 320k MP3.The Alan Parson's Project, Supertramp, ELO, The Eagles, Pink Floyd, Stevie Nicks, Blondie, Bon Jovie, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Joni Mitchell, Abba, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, 10000 Maniacs....... many more artists.I mostly use the headphones with an iPod Classic 160Gb, a Pioneer VSX-23TXH AVR, and sometimes with an old Dell laptop, all of these sources provide marvelous sound quality.Many reviewers have stated the 'need' for an amplifier, and this almost scared me off these but I have not found that to be the case at all.There is a difference between great sound quality and extremely loud volume levels, and only those people that want very loud volume levels will need an amplifier in addition to their portable player.The sound quality is excellent with everything I have plugged these into and in my opinion most adults will be more than satisfied with the volume level an iPod, laptop, or other portable player will produce.Other info, my Galaxy S3 phone sounds fine but it gets hot if I use the headphones with it and it does not get hot using the earbuds that came with the iPod. The iPod does not get hot with the headphones. The AVR will get these loud enough it could cause hearing damage. I would buy these again.These headphones have a fairly flat frequency response that I appreciate, for bass lovers simply adjust the EQ a little bit in the player, saame for those that like the highs to sizzle, the frequency response of the headphones is not a defect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Take the leap, they really are worth it...", "unixReviewTime": 1373155200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2013"}
