Scott \"retired slacker\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I've always thought people bought expensive audio equipment because the price made them feel like it was better but these headphones give the most genuine audio experience I've ever had. Even when listening to Pandora radio's 192kbps audio streams I can hear things in songs that I didn't know existed before. All my previous headphones had a sharp drop-off in performance in the high frequency end of the spectrum where some artists apparently like to put subtle atmospheric sounds like wind or even violin playing in. Thanks to these headphones I can now both hear and enjoy these subtle additions to the songs.The one thing that i find a bit lacking with these headphones is bass. They are accurate with regards to bass but I'm so used to my super bassy earbuds that I find the bass produced by these headphones lacking.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2013"}
