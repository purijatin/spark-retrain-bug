Having tried them out for the past year I was convinced that they lacked the low end range needed to represent the music stage.  They are good for vocals and single instruments i.e. harpsichord, violin, guitar but again to restate, the sound stage is lacking.Now, having read multiple reviews of the Sens 600, I recently bought them especially for the reason above - I wanted to feel imersed in the music, both wanting to hear the instruments and the deep lows making the stage.  These headphones give me all that.  The individual instruments are heard as well as the AKGs but now the deeper cello and base are heard and felt.  The drums come alive.  I feel the soundstage as I could not with the AKGs.My setup is somewhat portable.  I use a phillips portable CD player connected to a total airhead amp.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones I have owned", "unixReviewTime": 1012953600, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2002"}
