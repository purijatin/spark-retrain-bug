They have a different sound signature than my first pair I got in the HE-400 as these have a bit warmer over all tone with less bright highs yet the treble is still very detailed as is the rest of the frequencies.  The HD600 has a very balanced neutral sound that works well with every type of music I've listened to on them and the main type of music I listen to is EDM and these sound great with that.  Some people might say that they don't have enough bass and that's because these are reference headphones so they don't have a boosted bass like a lot of other headphones like the consumer oriented Beats and the like.  Mids are lush, smooth and quite detailed as well as the treble as I said before.  These being an open-back headphones gives them a great soundstage and the imaging and instrument separation is also very nice.I really enjoy this headphone as its very comfortable and the sound signature is balanced, smooth and easy to listen to for long sessions.  At around $300 to $400 depending were you get them (Accessoryjack.com has them new for $310) I feel they're well worth it and the sound better than my $400 pair of Earsonic SM3's and the $300 Heir Audio 3.Ai IEM's I had.  Anyone that's not a basshead I feel would really enjoy the HD600 and if you have the cash I would recommend you buy a pair.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pure Class", "unixReviewTime": 1365984000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2013"}
