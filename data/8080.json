The design is fantastic, though some have pointed out it could be made of hardier material. Very true, but they're definitely sturdy enough for home use. Sound is brilliant and balanced. Bass is plentiful, though maybe not as deep as DT880/600. I feel like the DT880 sounds more distant though, or perhaps it's a volume discrepancy (switching between headphones of different efficiencies will do that). I upgraded to the HD650 cable which is beefier and more reliable. My second pair I bought for $120 with a Bithead amp, there was no way I could pass that up. No complaints at all about the HD600, only the weak stock cable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So good, I got a second pair!", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}
