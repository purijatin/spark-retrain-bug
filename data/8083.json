Lowenbach \"Photographer\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I have been buying headphones for years now, looking for just the right one. It has been a long journey, but I am finally here. The last pair I owned was a pair of Stax electrostatics that was so uncomfortable I could only wear them for half an hour at a time. (It doesn't matter how good headphones sound if they hurt you.) The HD 600 is the last headphone I'll buy. It does exactly what I want with precision, grace and charm, and I can comfortably wear them all day long. Anything above this gets so far past the point of diminishing returns that it would become embarrassing and financially foolish for me to go there.I am running these with a classic Pioneer Elite integrated amp that has a very nice headphone section. The first sign for me of a good set of cans is when I keep taking them off to check if my main speakers are playing. These are like that... I'm listening late at night and I think I must be disturbing people because the soundstage is expansive and the sound so sweet and full on these things.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "End of the Journey", "unixReviewTime": 1357948800, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2013"}
