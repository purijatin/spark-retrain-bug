Bought them on sale and because of the superior feedback. They absolutley need a break in period. The soundstage was very tight, now with many hours on them they are opening up and begining to open up and sound relaxed. At first I did not have an Headphone amp and drove them only with and Ipod and the 600's sounded flat/dull. Thought i wasted my money!After many, many hours of research I settled on the Firestone Audio Fubar 3 MkII USB DAC/Headphone Amp. Oh boy what a difference! IMO you absolutley need an amp to drive these high impedence headphones properly. Bless you if your happy with the sound without an ampifier is all i can say, but you are missing out big time without one.On a down side tho, I do not hear the mystical soundstage yet. I it probably my sound source at fault, well hopefully it is. I do have an MP3 collection recorded at highest quality, maybe the headphones need more time and breakin? Overall they are pretty awesome, especially gotten at half price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphone and only getting better", "unixReviewTime": 1321920000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2011"}
