I needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd Generation iPod Touch.  I can report that this mic works perfectly.If you need fancy cut offs, filters, or you expect concert quality results, please go elsewhere.  If you want something that works well for much less than $10, get this mic or get a couple of them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than expected", "unixReviewTime": 1362182400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2013"}
