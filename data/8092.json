They are comfortable and velvet ear cups prevent sweating. Can be listened to without headamp but will lack bass on Ipod and portable compact disc players.This is all the headphone you will ever need. I paid $275 on Amazon for these phones and was not willing to buy the NEW 650 hd ones for around $60 more at J&R; Music world. I have heard they have a hyped up bass response and are not as balanced as the 600 HD.If you don't want to spend this type of money, buy the 595 hd or 555 hd, they will be vey pleasing & comfortable to your ears @ MUCH MORE REASONABLE PRICES!UPDATE 2/6/2011: Still have these phones and they still sound great. Upgraded cord to 650 heavier stock cord about 2 years ago and they sounded even better. No need to buy anything more than the 600s! I see now that these phones go for $399. This is a lot more than I paid for them.  They are classic but probably not worth $400 bucks. I don't think any phones are worth that much. The search for the perfect phones does not exist. After a certain balanced sound is achieved, and wearing comfort is found, it becomes more about a matter of \"personal taste\" of how good they sound rather than an \"absolute\" better sound! So buy what is comfortable and sounds good to you after trying different types of phones, open air, closed, portables, etc. These 600s worked for me as my main home listening phones for about 30 minutes but then I switch to my portable phones like the Sennheiser PX100, Koss Porta-Pro and Koss KDE/250.  I find them less bulky and more enjoyable for longer listening.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THE BEST @ A SOMEWHAT REASONABLE COST", "unixReviewTime": 1189296000, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2007"}
