Nothing in my extensive experience with high fidelity sound had prepared me for what awaited my senses after I put on my brand new HD 600's and a CD I thought I knew well after literally 100's of listens.  The bottom line is this:  The Sennheiser HD 600's will most likely give you the best and most satisfying listening experience of your life.  Period!  Build quality is very strong and perhaps due to the fact that these phones are not made in China, but in Ireland of all places.  (no offense to Chinese manufacturing)  Do your homework and research the 600's online.  Every good thing you read about them is TRUE!  No kidding!  Yes, Sennheiser does make the 650's and yes, they are supposedly a slight improvement over the 600's, but unless you are going to be using an esoteric CD transport and specialized headphone amp, chances are you would never notice the difference.  The only other Sennheiser model that can really outdo these phones cost in the neighborhood of 12 thousand dollars..  So for under $300 , you just can not go wrong.  Do they really sound that much better than Bose Tri-ports or 99 dollar Sony's ?  The answer is, YES YES YES !  I have wasted many years listening with inferior headphones and now look forward to many years of superior music reproduction and many happy hours of pure sonic bliss (yes , I actually said that) listening to my newest most prized possession, the Sennheiser HD 600's....  As another reviewer stated, it's like getting a completely new CD collection.  You think you know your favorite music?  Try these and be amazed!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These phones have totally blown me away!", "unixReviewTime": 1185494400, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2007"}
