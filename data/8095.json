I have a set of HiFiMan HE-400s that I was enjoying until they were dethroned by a set of Audeze LCD-2.  I absolutely love the Audeze, and find them to be extremely neutral (do we really know what neutral is, though?) with my HiFiMan EF-5 amp, with a seductive midrange.But this review is about the HD-600.  A friend lent me his extremely tweaked Bottlehead Crack AND his HD-600s, since the Crack will not drive my planars well.  My god, I really love the HD-600 on that amp!  After doing some comparisons and finding that it is very true that the Crack will not drive low-impedance cans well, I pulled out my little Schiit Magni to do more listening.  The Senns sound fabulous on that amp, too (and so do the LCD-2, and in my opinion best the Senns just by a bit).So, that's a lot of typing to give some background.  I just wanted to say that it would be highly unlikely for anyone to be disappointed by these headphones.  I found them to be really great sounding, even in the company of my Audeze cans, so I might just have to have a set, if only to be able to enjoy, say, OTL headphone amps.I think these should be on your short list if you want some accurate headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I don't own these, but I might soon&#8230;", "unixReviewTime": 1403395200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2014"}
