I seem to have found it with these.  I can finally crank up the volume on my video games without worrying about what my neighbors are thinking of me.  It's really made me very happy.  They are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for 5 hour stretches with no fatigue.  I'm very happy with my decision.  I also can't believe the bass coming from these headphones, I never head such a range of sound before.My only suggestion to Sennheiser would be to instead of packing these in a ridiculously HUGE box that I threw away immediately (it also stank), to please include the little headphone hanger/clip thingie that my cheaper HD 485's came with.  I'm using that instead of the box daily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Fantastic Sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1233360000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2009"}
