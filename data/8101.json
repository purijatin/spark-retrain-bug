Build quality wise, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. Doesn't exactly feel too sturdy but it should be ok as long as you keep it at home. Definitely not as rugged as my HD380 or my Audio Technica ATH-M50. Now for the Sound Quality. Wow! Fantastic detail and clarity. Good sound-stage(not great but good). The mids are excellent. The highs are also excellent and I don't feel that the sound is veiled or that the treble is rolled off (as I read in some other reviews). The overall sound is very natural and the instruments sound realistic. Vocals are silky smooth. The low end is good and doesn't step over any of the frequencies. Since nothing is perfect, if I really must find something to criticize, it would have to be the lowest bass. Not as powerful or as deep as my HD380's(but then again those are closed). I usually end up eq'ing the bass just a notch but that's a matter of personal preference. Obviously these do need to be amped. They will probably get even better after break-in but right out of the box, I highly recommend them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Steal at this Price", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}
