It's almost too nice to through away!The headphones are comfortable, completely surround the ear, and have aweseome sound.  I'm ordering a mid range amplifier to give it more pep as my walkman doesn't have enough power to really drive these.  They are by far the best headphones I've ever owned.  You can't go wrong with the price - go for it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Headphones - At Any Price", "unixReviewTime": 1055203200, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2003"}
