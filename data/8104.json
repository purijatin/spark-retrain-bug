If you try using these nice cans to directly plug into your macbook pro or ipod, you're really wasting your money. I also have Etymotic ER-4P's and they sound nearly identical without microphone amp. With an amp, it really sets it apart, especially if you're going to pay almost $400.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones, need amp or else don't get it!", "unixReviewTime": 1297296000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2011"}
