They are a bit more neutral and more extended, with tighter, stronger bass as well as better defined highs.But I'm not sure they were worth the money, given that I already had a pretty good set of cans in the HD 595.They are discernably better (even w/o burn-in) but the comparative listening I've done indicates that the 595s are well within the \"same league.\"  Had I had the good sense to test both before buying either one, I would have spent the extra $$ on these.  The imaging (location of instruments and voices) is notably better (though the 595 is very good), and the dynamic range seems to be modestly better (tighter and stronger bass).  But since I already own the 595s, I'm not quite sure about whether to indulge myself by keeping these headphones or sending them back.I'm darned sure that, if I didn't already own the 595s, I'd be keeping them happily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "FANTASTIC, but not \"way better\" than HD 595s", "unixReviewTime": 1235606400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2009"}
