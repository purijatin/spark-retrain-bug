I was torn between these headphones and a pair of Shure 1440's. I feel Shure makes better microphones but you can't compare headphones and mics.So when I got them, I opened up the over-sized box and tried to plug them into my ipod to try them out. Oops. I need a one-eight inch adapter. You would think, for the money, it would come with that.So I got my adapter, plugged them into my ipod and.... oops. These headphones are not very loud.So I went into the settings on my ipod and turned the sound up all the way, turned the volume up all the way and .... oops. Why aren't these expensive headphones blasting my ears out?I guess you have to sacrifice volume to get quality.They sound crisp and clear.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best headphones I've ever owned.", "unixReviewTime": 1360281600, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2013"}
