The microphone was readily accepted by my iPod touch 3G and allows me to make Voice Memos.  I also tried it for a Skype call and it works!  Note other reviewers have noted you can't both have it in the iPod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers - this is a limitation of the iPod touch, and I refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the iPod touch like so many others have.  You CAN use it to make a Skype call, and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to \"speaker,\" either when making or receiving a call.  It's about the size of a very large pill.  I'm very pleased with the seller and the item.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works with iPod Touch 3G for Voice Memos, Skype Calls", "unixReviewTime": 1280707200, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2010"}
