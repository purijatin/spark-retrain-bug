I listen to mostly classical music - lots of solo piano and guitar - and the sound is spactacular compared to the Bose speakers I was using.  I do not use the \"loudness\" setting on my receiver anymore.  Sound is great at all volume levels.  Clarity of sound is remarkable and the bass is more than adequate.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What a value!", "unixReviewTime": 1016582400, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2002"}
