For a small speaker, they're pretty good, BUT I like chamber music and in particular string quartets.  I find the close-miked string reproduction generally boxy, and have to play them at background levels, otherwise I find the sound annoying.  Piano reproduces well, as do vocals.  I found they were very susceptible to sympathetic vibration when I placed them on bookshelves or small tables, and ended up buying a pair of Sanus speaker stands (see my review), which has improved the sound considerably.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "OK for a small speaker", "unixReviewTime": 1076716800, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2004"}
