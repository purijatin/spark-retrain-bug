I'd been thinking of buiding a surround system... and when these were offered to me - I figured I'd dish out the cash for these and a recevier /amplifier, use these as my main speakers for a while, then buy tower speakers.  This idea worked out amazingly well.  I was quite suprised by how small these speakers were when I unpacked them.  Sure, they're much larger than standard rear speakers - but they *aren't* meant to be rear speakers.  I was worried, however, that they wouldn't put out enough sound to be used as my main speakers for very long.  Boy was I wrong!  These little speakers don't only sound amazing, they can handle loads of power.  This is one product where the marketing hype is really backed up by the real-world performance.  I've now added the tower speakers, and made these little guys my rear spearks, for which they seem to be well suited.  Either way you choose to use them, I'm sure you'll be suitably impressed!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little speakers", "unixReviewTime": 1037836800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2002"}
