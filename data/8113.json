Wharfedale instructions are true - if you place them about two feet from the wall (back surface) the bass is incredible. So, in a sense, while they'll fit on a &quot;bookshelf&quot;, they don't perform their best on a shelf. I adjusted placement and am very pleased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "skeptical before - now very pleased", "unixReviewTime": 1043452800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2003"}
