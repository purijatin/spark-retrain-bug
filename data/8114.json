I had the powerful Infinity subwoofer to thump the neighbors right off their sofa.But what to buy to replace those ancient rear speakers I'd gotten for free with a so-so stereo so many years ago?I didn't want to spend much money for mere rear channel sound, but I didn't want to compromise much quality, either. Frankly, it seemed a waste to spend any money at all back there.Then I heard Wharfedale's Diamond Anniversery Bookshelf Speakers.They look great, they sound great. And Amazon has a price you just can't beat.Not only do my DTS and Dolby 5.1 movies sound better than ever, but my neighbors find me just a little bit more bothersome.UPDATE:  We've moved into a bigger house, and are now using these as our main speakers in upstairs living room.  They sound so delicious, I realize they were wasted as mere rear-channel speakers back at the old condo.  There's no better deal in bookshelf speakers today.  Buy these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tough to Beat at Any Price", "unixReviewTime": 1029715200, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2002"}
