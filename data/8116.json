They have very good optical properties, the occular adjustment was able to adjust between both my eye's. (I have seen some binoculars that did not have enough range in the occular to adjust between the difference in my eye's) and the brightness of the image was very good for such a small diameter lense. IMHO this is a superior product to Bushnell and Tasco products of similar design and you can't beat the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Price, Great Binoculars!", "unixReviewTime": 1002240000, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2001"}
