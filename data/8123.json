Images are crystal clear so is the color and sound. Unlike ( JVC ) which I had 2 new  tapes that would not work when put into the VCR the wheels holding the tape would not turn wound up throwing them away after I took one out the tape snapped in half I'll never buy JVC againTop VHS tape brands I use are1 Maxell. 2 Sony. 3 Fuji. 4 Scotch. 5 TDK.  They wear like iron along with new ones I also have some that I have been using for 3 years now some longer. I do try to get the high grade ones when I can they are somewhat more durable, but the standard are great to so I am content with thatRecording and time limitsT200 records up to 10 hours..T190 9 hrs....T160 8 hrs..T120 6 hrs", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Tapes Get The Job Done", "unixReviewTime": 1385683200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2013"}
