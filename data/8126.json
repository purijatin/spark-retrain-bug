Dizon", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have had this unit (DI-701) for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted here.I upgraded to the newest firmware 4.10 because I needed the IPSec protocol that the 4.06 didnt have and it seems to work fine until I tried to access Netflix.com. The unit totally halts. All lights stay on and the unit cannot be found through its configurator. I have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running again.I called tech support and they told me to call Netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests. I told him that Netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware. And it shouldn't be the case since I was able to access Netflix with the 4.06 firmware. Who knows what other site it cannot access. So to the recycling bin it goes!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Dont bother if you need IPSec, security or Netflix  0-star", "unixReviewTime": 1051747200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2003"}
