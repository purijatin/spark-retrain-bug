The DHCP function worked fine, and it seemed relatively reliable.But my primary need was for the firewall function.  I wanted to protect an HTTP server, so I set up the DI-701 to pass port 80 requests to my web server.That worked fine, too, until I realized that the DI-701's settings are easily hacked from outside the firewall.  That's because the DI-701 may be configured via telnet from outside the firewall, and its password is inherently insecure.  Get this: The password is limited to six characters, it's transmitted in the clear, and the DI-701 allows unlimited attempts with the wrong password, without even a delay between attempts.That means the most simple-minded script kiddie can just run through hundreds of thousands of passwords until he gets in, and then he can give himself (and the rest of the world) unlimited access to your LAN.A secondary concern is that computers inside the firewall can't connect to computers outside the firewall via Microsoft's &quot;VPN&quot; (PPTP) protocol.  I need that, too.  Purportedly the competing Linksys device works with PPTP, and it's only a bit more expensive.The DI-701 is cheap.  If you don't need its firewall features or PPTP, go for it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "&quot;Firewall&quot; Feature Crippled by Bad Design", "unixReviewTime": 978048000, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2000"}
