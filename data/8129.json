These are &quot;rookie mistakes&quot; and disqualify D-Link from serious consideration as a network vendor. The stuff is just too complicated to trust someone who doesn't really know what they're doing.I ended up sending the thing back (not to Amazon, another vendor) and buying the Linksys Etherfast unit, which costs a bit more but is rock solid (and includes a couple of switched Ethernet ports, to boot).  Several of my friends use that with success.  Save yourself some time, and buy the right thing in the first place.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Zero Stars -- Buy Linksys Instead", "unixReviewTime": 995673600, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2001"}
