I am a PC/Network tech and I use this card on new & old Win PCs as well as RedHat, Mandrake & SUSE Linux.  The Nix distros all recognize it without any additional drivers.  If you want to compile it into the kernel, get the driver form Dlink and have at it, but it is not necessary.This NIC performs great on each OS I've used it on.  It is a great card for ADSL and works perfectly with SpeadStream DSL modems.  The 3Com cards may have more bells & whistles, but for this price you can't go wrong - and a lifetime warranty at that.  The retail for this card is somewhere around 35 or 40.  Overall, unless you have a specific need for a specialty NIC, try this one!...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Greeeaaat!", "unixReviewTime": 1037836800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2002"}
