I found the install easy and trouble free- but the quality isn't what I'd expected.  The RJ45 connection is poor (cable doesn't lock in) and I've lost my  connection several times, having to remove the card to get a proper  connection.  This may well be a faulty card, but I can only speak from my  experience with the one, which thus far has not been great.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Easy install, questionable quality", "unixReviewTime": 961200000, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2000"}
