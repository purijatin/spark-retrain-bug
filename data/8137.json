I ordered this card to enable me to use the MB with Windows Server 2008 R2.  It works perfectly.  Card is recognized on install and driver loaded automatically.  Later, I upgraded to Windows Server 2012 and the card works perfectly with that version of the server product also.  Easy to install, and didn't have to bother with the install CD.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works perfectly with my setup", "unixReviewTime": 1353369600, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2012"}
