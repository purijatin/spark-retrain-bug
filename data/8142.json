I am still using this over my onboard NIC now and it seems to work great so far and have not had any problems with it at all.The drivers install quickly and was very easy,even grabbed the latest ones online that I could find and those work well also.The only weird part with this NIC card that I have never seen was this card would get no link light on my cable modem when plugged directly into it,even the link light on the back of the nic card would not turn green. So in turn it would never get an IP and was not able to get on the internet.As soon as I would plug it into my router I would get a link light on both the router and the nic card and it would grab a IP from the router instantly and I was all set to go. Now this isn't a big deal for me but there is still quite a bit of ppl out there that just hook directly up to their cable modems and this could cause problems unless it's some sort of defect with mine.I gave it 4 stars because of this. This doesn't matter much for me or most people with a router,but can cause some problems like I had when I was trouble shooting my connection and was trying to rule out any problems with my router and could not directly connect to my modem with this card.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Seems to work well.", "unixReviewTime": 1302048000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2011"}
