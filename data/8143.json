I have yet had to have one fail.  Install is easy and straight forward (Shut the PC down, install/swap NIC, turn on computer, insert CD and let Windows do the rest).  I can replace the old card and have the user back online in around 5 minutes.  You can't go wrong with this as a basic network card.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Been Buying These For Years.
