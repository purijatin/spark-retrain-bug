Within 2 days I had my product. I installed the drivers, powered off, then installed the card and connected my line. Simple, and it solved my issue. Luckily I backed up my computers to a backup drive before, so I have all my files intact pre-virus. I use this at home, so for a business I cannot rate it, but I am happy with the speed and simplicity! For uner $10.00 plus shipping I couldn't have gotten a better deal. I do have a D-Link card for wireless connection from before, so hmmmm. I will have to see what I can do with that.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy!", "unixReviewTime": 1307491200, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2011"}
