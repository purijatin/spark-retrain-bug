It asked for the location and that was easy to figure out. After that, I got on the Internet and the speed was just as advertised. My at home online speed is 1.5MB and that's what I get with the card. I highly recommend this card.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Card! 5 Stars!", "unixReviewTime": 1248912000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2009"}
