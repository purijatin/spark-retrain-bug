Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the \"minimum requirement\" was OS 10.2.They lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won't work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn't.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.It's my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn't seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.This is the second D-Link product I've used (the first was a cable modem) and I've been disappointed both times.  I can't speak for Windows users, but this company doesn't deserve Mac business.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Mac users: D-Link's claims about compatibility are false.
