This card is a breeze to install.  First install the software, then install the card, turn your computer back on, and your ready for the internet or to connect to a network!  I have installed at least five of these cards into computers over the past year, and have not gotten one call that they are not working!  This is a great price point, and great product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price", "unixReviewTime": 1143590400, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2006"}
