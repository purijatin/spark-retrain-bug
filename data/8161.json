Boy, was I wrong or what?  The installation is so easy, it took 2 minutes and 40 seconds, including opening and closing the computer cover, and software driver.  The card's performance is second to none, far exceeds my Linksys and Netgear, even Intel cards.  Ever since, I've buying this particular card for my home and professional networking use, and it never failed me.I know some people gets uncomfortable when they see a &quot;ancient floppy disk&quot; for storing driver.  But darn it, it works great.  And what's amazing about D-Link, is that they always seem to include the latest driver in their packaging.  I have bought over 60 of these cards, and the driver date is just barely 2 - 3 months old on every purchase.  Consider Linksys, their drivers are at least 1 year old.  To top it off, Windows 2000 and ME has build-in drivers for this card, and the floppy isn't even needed.Overall, this is a good performing card at a wonderful price.  They use the SAME chipset (stamped with their own name) that other competitors use as well, but they did it much less expensive... Definitely +++!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Looks cheap, but works amazingly well!!", "unixReviewTime": 984873600, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2001"}
