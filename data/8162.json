It works well with D-link DI7-04 router and D-Link DSS-5+ switch. I use these products to build a home network (PC/laptop/servers/PowerMac) with internet sharing on one cable modem.  If you just want to use this NIC with internet-sharing router by using DHCP as the default, the configuration is fairly easy.  If you want to use this NIC with a swicth to build a home network, it take a little more understanding of TCP-IP network to get it done right.  Nevertheless, it is a good combination with D-link DI704 router and D-Link DSS-5+ switch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good companion with D-Link router and switch", "unixReviewTime": 989884800, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2001"}
