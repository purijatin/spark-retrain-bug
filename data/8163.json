Komanetsky", "helpful": [7, 26], "reviewtext": "If your a Palm user, don't bother spending the money on a Windows CD device.How tough is it? The E-115 has a great display (the only reason this review has 1 star), but the battery, CF and Synch doors are so thin  and fragile, you'll be calling Casio up within a week to get replacements.  The whole unit seems so fragile, that I'm afraid to stand up from my chair  while holding it.PC Synchronization: The unit also syncs very slowly  with your PC compared to Palm devices.  It can take a long as a half hour  to sync the E-115 even with all serial ports setup for their fastest  speeds! The PC Synchronization application (ActiveSync) routinely locks up  in Windows 2000.  You have to open Task manager and close 2 processes to  bring it up again.  Very Very bad.Features: There is nothing additional  that the E-115 provides (except for the great color screen) that Palm  devices do not provide at 1/2 the cost and reliability.  Why I ever thought  this was an upgrade was beyond me.Support: There is no documentation  (physical) that comes with the unit.  Just a quick-start guide which is  more quick than start.  Microsofts site for supporting PocketPC is either  not there or so bad that it cannot be found.  Support from Casio is the  same if not worse.Applications: Application installation is tedious and  difficult.  You need to go to multiple locations to install a single  application which makes this device much harder than any of the Palm  devices.  Also, there is really nothing available on the E-115 that isn't  available (cheaper) on Palm devices.I was very excited to get my E-115.  Now I'm very excited to get my money back.  Sorry.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't bother spending the money", "unixReviewTime": 963532800, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2000"}
