You can read ebooks and listen to audiobooks from audio.com, both from within MS Reader.My only  complaint is that the device seems to slow down after opening more than 4  or 5 programs.  Also, I have needed to &quot;reboot&quot; the machine more  than with my E-11, but it has not been troublesome for me.Overall, great  product and great performance.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best of the Pocket PC's", "unixReviewTime": 963360000, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2000"}
