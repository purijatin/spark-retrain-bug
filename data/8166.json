This is my first PDA experience, and everything is very useful. This is much more than a PDA - so stop comparing it to a Palm. This truly is a  productivity machine. For me it replaces the need for a laptop, especially  with the nice Transcribe (handwriting recognition) capability and a 56K  modem (additional). The Casio active display is the best on the market -  much nicer than the Jornada's passive display - with beatiful color. You  really can't say enough about the display quality. It's bulkier than the HP  Jornada 545, but the display and additional RAM make up for it. It's not a  shirt pocket machine (size-yes, weight-no), but it works nicely in a  portfolio cover or attached to a belt.On the wish-list side: 1)a task  list to kill active programs easier, 2)a more useful battery life meter,  3)a way to disable the front panel buttons - they are easy to accidentally  press while writing, but it's like that on all the PocetPC devices out  there (but the HP does offer a disable function), 4)a longer life  battery.All in all, a great value as a laptop/mobile replacement. But if  you only need a contact/addressbook PDA, this is overkill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost perfect", "unixReviewTime": 956620800, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2000"}
