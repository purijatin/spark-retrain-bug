It has a sufficient  amount of built-in storage; it records voice at the touch of a button; it  plays voice and MP3s through a built-in speaker, which does not sound bad  (or you can use headphones); it syncs with your Outlook and other Office  documents; and it also includes IE and MS Reader.The screen is VERY easy  to read and the color very good (although 12 bit not 16 bit). Word  documents look great, even tables are readable (although large tables are  tough because of the small screen size). Same goes for Web pages, save  pages for offline viewing and you can read them on the iPaq (screen size  annoyance depends on the particular Web page design).The only bad things  I can say is that the auto-light sensor does not work well for me. It  usually picks a setting too dark for my tastes. Syncing Outlook Tasks is a  bit annoying as it sticks them all as documents in your sync folder.  Syncing on my Win98SE system with USB is erratic but works flawlessly on  Windows 2000 Pro. Closing porgrams is annoying, even with the Compaq  button. Why they left out the close button on each app is beyond  me.Overall this is the best PDA yet. All the advantages of a Palm plus  it works with your regular Office documents and has a useful Web browser.  Getting used to it takes about an hour. It suffers from the obvious limits  of its size but this is its advantage as well. The screen makes reading  easy and I've read 40 page Word documents on it with ease.With some more  memory, a modem card, and perhaps a travel keyboard like they have for the  Palm, you really can leave your laptop at home.Now if only the  expansions would get off backorder so I could get some more memory...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best PDA so far", "unixReviewTime": 968198400, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2000"}
