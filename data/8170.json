This is the best Windows CE Pocket PC on the market. Itis fast (due to the speedy Intel processor) and the display iswonderful.  The Microsoft reader is a real delight! Although it tookme a long time to get one... it was worth it. I was more than happy toretire my old Casiopeia E-11.  I have seen the HP and the newCasiopeia but I was swayed by the faster processor and the displaythat was almost as good as the new Casiopeia (in fact I prefer theIpaq just a little). The ability to open both the Word and Excelattachements leave my friends with their Palm Pilot's green withenvy. Did I mention that I really like this little jewel?
