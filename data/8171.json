I have been waiting on mail-order lists  for over 3 months.This unit replaces my Casio E-100.  This unit does  not compare.  It consistantly outdoes my E-100.  The screen is truly  viewable in all light situations.  I took the unit out in full direct  sunlight.  I was able to clearly see the screen and use it.  This is not  possible with the E-100.  I am also impressed with the speed.  Push a  button or icon and the application is instantly loaded.  206 Mhz does make  a drastic difference in speed.  The USB connection allows me to synchronize  in seconds.  It takes minutes using the serial port on the E-100.  The  power meter shows actual battery life left, as opposed to other units that  indicate simply low and high.  My unit is too new to comment on the battery  life.  So far it appears to be very good.I have absolutely no buyers  remorse on this one.  It is a productive tool for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really Great Product!", "unixReviewTime": 965520000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2000"}
