So I feel my opinion comes from experience and I can happily say, \"My iPAQ with a 1-gig IBM micro-hard drive and 56K modem replaced my laptop, Palm Pilot, MP3 player and portable DVD player\".  And I'm looking forward to it replacing my cell phone.  I keep seeing people write the Palm Pilot is better/easier to use for scheduling, contacts and email.  I'm not sure what PDAs they were using, but unless you're buying on price alone, there is NO comparison.  The iPAQ looks up schedules, contacts and email faster, has better text input, has a MUCH easier to read screen and does many little things like auto formatting phone numbers, word (and area code) completion to save you time writing and supports all of the fields of information from Outlook.  Bottom line... I bet you're not driving a Hugo, so why carry the equivalent in a PDA.  The iPAQ is sexy, fast and simple to use and with accessories, cost 30% of the items it replaced for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My iPAQ replaced my laptop, Palm, MP3 player and DVD player", "unixReviewTime": 970444800, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2000"}
