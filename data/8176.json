Here the reasons why I chose this over Palms or other Pocket PCs.Pocket PC beat PalmVx for its color support and the kind of applications it supports and for its ability to upgrade.So, it came down to Pocket PCs.The best Casio is too crooked looking and heavy! The latest was OK but the style was missing compared with the iPAQ. HP lost with iPAQ in the color brightness category. HP not only looks too simple compared with silvery look of iPAQ, it [costs] more for nearly the same features. Of course, HP has a built in slot for compact flashcard which is a big plus for it. I almost got it before I decided if I will use the built in slot a lot! It was a close one between these two and I choose iPAQ mainly for the looks, and the color depth it gives over HPs and the ratings it got over other pocket PCs and most of all it almost looks as cool as PalmVx in looks!PalmVx is way overvalued for what it can be done with it compared with Pocket PCs but I agree it has the coolest looking hardware.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Couldn't find a better one than this!", "unixReviewTime": 971395200, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2000"}
