However, there is one problem with it, which is that the sylus sometimes gets stuck and you can't release it with the button anymore. Somebody else here complained about that and said he had to return his and get it replaced.I have the same problem with mine, but there is a fix for it. This started happening after a couple of weeks and has happened at least 10 times so far, since I use mine a lot, but using this trick I have always been able to get it out again.  Just turn the iPAQ upside down and tap on the side near the stylus hole, and also try hitting the butten a few times while you're at it. This has always worked and gotten it un-stuck. After that, the button will work again and release the stylus--until the next time it gets stuck.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stylus Fix", "unixReviewTime": 970704000, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2000"}
