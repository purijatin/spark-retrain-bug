That unit was a replacement for my Palm IIIXE.  Each time I have changed my Handheld, it has been a step up.  Now, going to the 3650 has been a giant step forward.The color screen is great.  It is well lit, easy to read.  The programs that come with the unit halp me keep myself organized at home or on the road.  I already used Microsoft Outlook to organize everything while at my desk.  The Activesync software that comes with the Ipaq automatically found all my appointment, calendars, and contacts and put them into my Ipaq for me.Sure, it only has 32mb of storage.  But I have hundreds of contacts, 40-60 eamails per day, and I subscribe to Avantgo for offline web broiwsing and I never get near the maximum.If I want to store some music files, I just add a 64mb Compact Flash card and I have plenty of space.  That 64mb card can store about 2 and a half albums when compressed into WMA format.  I use my Ipaq on planes as a music player similar to an MP3 player (Can't call it an MP3 player if I use WMA files, can I?)  All I do is hook up my headphones, turn on the media player (Included with PocketPC software), and put the player in my breast pocket.The only thing I would like to see is longer battery life.  I regularly travel and after 8-10 hours of continuous use, I have to recharge it.One accessory I would recommend....I picked up a USB Sync cable that also recharges the battery from your USB port.  It's great when on the road...one cable both charges and syncs up the Ipaq...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Close to perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1024790400, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2002"}
