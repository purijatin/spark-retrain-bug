A bit bulky with the dual expansion sleeve, but fast and functional.I am using a DLink wireless card with a wireless 802.11b access point both at home and work.  I can now quickly and easily check email or look up a website and carry it around.  It did take a bit of research getting thw wireless to work though.The ipaq is also pretty pricey once you get the jacket, the network card and expansion memory or an ibm microdrive.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wireless Wonder", "unixReviewTime": 994550400, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2001"}
