It is just like Windows and has everything Windows has to offer in a little tiny version.  I am a programmer, and love the ability to connect to databases with this productMP3.  What else do I need to say about that??  Wonderful!Document Library: A specially designated place tos tore eBooks was a wonderful idea!Screen: Crisp and clean.  Perfect clarity, much better than the Sony's.Con's:Battery Life: Very short.  I need to recharge fully every night and do a restore as the battery dies throughout the day.Size: Very bulky.  In today's marketplace I find it hard to believe this model cannot be more compact.  Warning: This BARELY fits in the Coach mini-office.Lack of accessories: Try to find a hardcase for this model.  Yikes!  Without it, your iPaq will turn on on its own, draining the battery even more.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love the concept and loved the product", "unixReviewTime": 1025222400, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2002"}
