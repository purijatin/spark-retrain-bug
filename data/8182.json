I couldn't ask for anything else.EDIT: I noticed they recently bumped the price up to $20. I would recommend you buy the Sony instead since it is still marked at $10. I have used it as well and it is the same quality as this radio with a slightly different layout for the tuning. Buy that instead and save 10 bucks.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheap, Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1357862400, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2013"}
