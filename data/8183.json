Nothing fancy, just an on-off wheel incorporating volume, another thumbwheel for tuning, a switch to go from AM to FM, and an earphone jack.But this unit isn't some clone from the 1960s.  It's much lighter and thinner than the brittle-shelled transistor radios of that era, and it tunes well. I was especially impressed by the fact that the little red tuning signal light below the speaker (indicating how well you've hit a station) works for the AM band as well as the FM.  The sound was something of a revelation to me -- it must help that the speaker is practically the width of the radio itself!Selectivity on FM seems very good, with the usual allowances for \"ghosts\" that allow extra-strong stations to come in at two or three different places.  Reception is stronger and clearer than I had expected.  Since this is not an all-digital unit, we are mercifully spared the \"birdies\" that sometimes trouble FM digital reception. I found AM clear and easily negotiable, too, especially using the red signal light mentioned above.Naturally, this kind of very basic model can be distinguished by what it doesn't have -- NOAA bands, crank dynamo charger and the ability to accept stereo earphones among the missing.  The unit will accept a mono earphone, which you must supply yourself.  But really, what do you expect for this kind of money?  Also, please note that the collapsible FM antenna swings out from the side of the unit, not up-and-down. I barely needed it for close-to-home stations, anyway.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice little AM-FM radio", "unixReviewTime": 1220572800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2008"}
