AM reception is worst of all my recent purchase - Sony, Sharp, Kaito, Sangean - all are miles better. While FM is ok, AM is sub standard - and having a mono headphone jack (one ear reception) is not making it better. Recommended only of you are living in an area where your favorite stations are very strong. I give it 2.5*.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "How can you rate this with 5 stars?", "unixReviewTime": 1342051200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2012"}
