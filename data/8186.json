Panasonic has done a marvelous job in recreating the classic \"transistor radio\" which fits perfectly in your hand.  It's controlled by the three standard radio controls: (1) an off/volume wheel, (2) a tuning wheel, and (3) an AM/FM band slider.  There's also a headphone jack, a telescoping antenna and a carrying strap.  The sound from the tiny speaker is surprisingly good, and it can be heard from the next room at half volume.I bought one of these rather than paying money to MLB to hear baseball on the web.  The reception is just fine in my basement apartment, which is more than I can say for my cellphone. And unlike the transistor radios of yore, it runs on two AA batteries.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Classic \"Transistor Radio\" with Three Controls", "unixReviewTime": 1004227200, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2001"}
