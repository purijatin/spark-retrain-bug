The batteries last forever.  The reception is excellent, except when close to a plasma TV set, then you get a lot of buzz.  No problem, though, since if you're listening to the radio, you probably don't need to be watching your HD TV.  Another thing I like a LOT about this radio is that it easily sets down on a countertop or a dresser, or whatever.  It's bottom is substantially wide and flat, making it very solid and stable on a firm surface.  Why don't phones come with AM radio?  I love my cheap Nokia cell phone and use it for FM all the time, but no AM.  Why????  Thus, I use this Panasonic.  It is WAY better than anything you'd find at RS, and it's MUCH better than any Sony I've had.  This one rocks.  Available with free super shipping for only $10!  I'm buying another one or two...one for the bathroom, one for the basement, etc... Love it.  I've had it for 9 months and it is still perfect...which beats most other junky pocket radios out there already, and I expect it to last a few more years.  I have accidentally dropped it a few times (ugh) but it has held up extremely well and has not had any problems.  It is very solidly built.  Panasonic is pure quality, imo.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great AM/FM Pocket Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1273708800, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2010"}
