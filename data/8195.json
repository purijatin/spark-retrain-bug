It's for sitting on the counter when the power is out, taking it out back by the pool to listen to the ballgame, and so on.  For those tasks, it's great.Much better volume control than the competing Sony.  Sure, it has an analog slide tuner.  Welcome to the 1960s.  It works.  It gets decent reception.  It only costs $10.What more can you ask for at that price?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for what it is", "unixReviewTime": 1366848000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2013"}
