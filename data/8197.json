The highest volume is fairly low but I really don't have a problem with that as some might.  My only real problem with the radio is that the tuning wheel is very small and touchy.  I have problems finding the station I want to listen to because it is so close to others.  My old hands have trouble making such fine tuning.  But, for the price, it's hard to beat.  Quality is not a problem even at this price (less than $10 at the time I bought it).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Value, discrimination poor", "unixReviewTime": 1372204800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2013"}
