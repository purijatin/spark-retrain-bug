I bought it along with the comparable sony model ICF-S10MK2.  I do a lot of construction and this is the perfect portable radio in that it is small, picks up tons of stations clearly, batteries last for a very long time, and it is loud for its size.  I pretty much only listen to talk radio on AM stations and this picks them up great.  I think the sound on the Panasonic is a little more clear compared to the sony model, but both are great, and for the price how could one really complain.  I would highly recommend it if you want a small portable pocket radio.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect Portable Radio", "unixReviewTime": 1207699200, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2008"}
