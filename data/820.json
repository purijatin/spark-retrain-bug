Plugged it in and thought that I should have read the reviews first. But there were also alot of good reviews.  So, I tried to think what was going on, plugging it in first it said \"no microphone\" when I went to my recording app.  I don't know if it did not go in all the way with the case on my Ipod, but I had to charge it and when I tried again with the case off, it did work.  IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE RECORDED, YOU HAVE TO DISCONNECT THE MICROPHONE. Made sure it was pushed in all the way when I put the case back on.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "THOUGHT I WAS RIPPED OFF TOO!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1302912000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2011"}
