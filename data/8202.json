I wanted something simple and easy and small so that I could listen at bedtime. I am an AM Radio fan. It really is perfect. If you choose to buy headphones or ear phones for this radio, buy a simple one because I purchased a Panasonic earphone set for IPod and the sound comes out of one ear speaker using this radio. That does not happen using it with any other music source. I know it's the radio. Simple radio, needs a simple ear phone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very cool little classic radio", "unixReviewTime": 1356825600, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2012"}
