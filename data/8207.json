This leaves me standing around with nothing to do; so, I thought I'd get a portable radio to listen to.  The RF-P50 by Panasonic works very well picking up the NPR station on FM and the local News-Talk AM stations that are each about 20 miles distant.  It also picks up more distant stations, some 100 miles away, with varying degrees of static.  The nearly identical Sony ICF-S10MkII portable that I bought at the same time works just as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Panasonic RF-P50 Great portable radio.", "unixReviewTime": 1327536000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2012"}
