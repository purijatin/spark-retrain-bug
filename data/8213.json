At night, I can tune it real low for some distant AM station without disturbing my spouse .I just had it for over two weeks but I already gave the Ipods to my kids since this Panny  does have a speaker and an AM/FM tuner.Best 10 bucks I've spent this year !", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect little radio for the beach !", "unixReviewTime": 1266624000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2010"}
