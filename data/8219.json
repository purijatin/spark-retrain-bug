I listen to the radio a lot, often news and sports and hate having ear buds in my ears 24-7.While I like the design of the Panasonic alot better, it's smaller and looks more modern, this radio does not have the reception that the Sony ICF-S10MK2 does.  In fact, stations I get with ease on the other radio were difficult to find on this one.  Also, the a.m. sound  quality is very muffled. The little wheel that pulls in the stations is difficult to turn.If there weren't a better alternative, I imagine that this would be a good enough cheap little radio.  If you are trying to decide between the two, go for the Sony.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "So-so little radio at great price", "unixReviewTime": 1326585600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2012"}
