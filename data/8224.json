Tuning is very difficult because the turns ratio between the thumb wheel and tuning capacitor is too course. Just a small rotation of the thumb wheel causes too much change of the tuning capacitor making it hard to hit the center point of a signal. Since AM tuning is non-linear, the effect is more pronounced at the high end of the AM band. Also, a typical pair of headphones with a stereo plug will not fit the radio's earphone jack. This is because both the radio and headphone jack are mono, not stereo. Sadly, for just a few cents more per unit, this could have been a very enjoyable stereo radio that works with existing stereo headphones. As it is, it's little more than a child's toy. On a positive note, the use of two AA cells rather than the typical 9 volt battery indicates a well designed and efficient circuit. This should enhance battery life as well as replacement cost efficiency. Summary: Impossible to use with stereo headphones. Ok for use as a cheap emergency radio to be kept with emergency supplies, etc. But, I would not recommend for every day use.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Built to look nice", "unixReviewTime": 1283472000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2010"}
