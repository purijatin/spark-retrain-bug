I store it in an end table so that it is convenient if needed.  It is light weight, but great for occasional use.  It works well and I feel comfortable knowing that I am not incommuncado with the rest of the world.  I would not recommend it for constant use, but it is a great backup that is both economical and functional.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "transistor radio", "unixReviewTime": 1352419200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2012"}
