Stewart", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I thought I could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse.  When doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was 5-6 times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic.  About the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch away.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Only an improvement over no microphone at all", "unixReviewTime": 1309824000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2011"}
