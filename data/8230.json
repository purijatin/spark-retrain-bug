It is an good size to hold grasp in the palm of my hand.  The sound quality is good for its size.  And, the radio is simple to use: one dial for to click on and adjust volume, and another dial to tune in your favorite station.  Seems to work for many hours on one pair of AA batteries.  I highly recommend!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent pocket radio", "unixReviewTime": 1147478400, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2006"}
