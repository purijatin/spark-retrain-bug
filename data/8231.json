Now, a Japanese brand transistor radio is made in China and costs more than 10 hours of their wages to buy. Yet, this is a good radio. It's fairly inexpensive, gets pretty good reception, and the speaker is surprisingly good for the cost. The slide tuner is a little inaccurate and frequencies close together are tedious to tune, but I just use an indelible Sharpie to mark the spots for the few stations I listen to and align the bar with the marks. Because so many people who write books tell us that consequences of a nation's successful development can be an inability to compete effectively in the manufacture of goods, balance of trade deficits, and, finally, economic collapse, this is a nice radio to get soon.  If you think you'll need a little radio like this, I'd advise getting it now before it once again costs many hours of wages  -- ours.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Radio Days", "unixReviewTime": 1159401600, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2006"}
