The plastic case looks good compared to most low-rent transistor radios these days. Be warned however that there is a red diode that lights up, to tell you when you've locked on to the full strength signal of a station.This radio is almost impossible to tune; unless you put fresh batteries in it mo more than 3-4 days ago. After that, it begins to drain the batteries very quickly. One assumes this is because a red diode indicator begins draining the batteries as soon as you put them in. The diode is redundant/pointless; you don't need it because when a station is tuned correctly, the proof is in the audio, not some useless light. Frequently the red glow is good and strong when the station is not tuned right, and a program is flooded with static. And the diode is off completely when you find the stronger signal.Once the batteries start draining (one week?) tou get two results with this radio. 1) static, or, 2) pulsing static which makes listening pretty aggravating.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The worst radio I've ever owned", "unixReviewTime": 1330992000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2012"}
