Amazing that it's still being sold. Rather a simple product, sucks up a butload of power, mono sound, the sound is kind of weird sounding on music, but its probably the sheer age of the thing. If it's lasted 20 years with little care given to it, i think it's a good buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good..for a 20 year old product...", "unixReviewTime": 1242691200, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2009"}
