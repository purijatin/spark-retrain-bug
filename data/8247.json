Using 4 D cells or AC, this is a heavy unit by today's standards. Features old fashion slide in or out plastic carrying handle. If you need a rugged unit that will be used on a table and need to do a lot of recording or playback this would be a better choice than Panasonic's mini cassette recorder such as the RQ-L31 which is also an excellent cassette recorder. Unlike the mini cassette recorders this model will fast forward and rewind faster. The buttons feel solid so when you push you get a good response. Has an excellent pause control by releasing the capstan and pinch roller from the cassette removing that awful low whine found in mini cassette recorders. Has que, review and tape counter and can use external microphone or earphones. Larger speaker provide better and fuller sound. This is the last and best of Panasonic's shoe  box style units so if you like this 1970's style recorder get this and you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality Old School Cassette Recorder", "unixReviewTime": 1258502400, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2009"}
