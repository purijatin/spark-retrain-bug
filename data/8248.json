The case seems to be made of cheap plastic and the raised lettering on the front of the machine have sharp edges which reinforces my view that this is not a high quality recorder. Ignoring the quality of the casing, the machine is still rated a good buy based on its solid performance.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cheaply Made But Works Well", "unixReviewTime": 1395100800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2014"}
