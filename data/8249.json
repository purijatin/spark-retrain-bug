If used properly, this recorder is quite durable, although it's not as portable as pocket recorders.  The sound quality is good.  I only use it for lectures and not for music.  I'm happy that it's still available.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very good quality cassette recorder!", "unixReviewTime": 1404864000, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2014"}
