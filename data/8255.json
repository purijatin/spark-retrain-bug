IT'S NOT AROUND THE SAME SIZE AS TWO CASSETTES. IT DOES WORK VERY GOOD. DOES NOT EAT UP THE CASSETTES. IT'S A TRUSTED COMPANY. THERE IS NO LED LIGHT, FOR WHEN THE BATTERY GETS LOW. THE A/C OUTLET IS VERY HANDY, LESS TROUBLE THAN A LARGE BULKY ADAPTER. THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD. RECORDS WELL AND WHEN IN THE FF OR REWIND MODES, ALSO PLAY MODE THE CASSETTE SHUTS OFF. THIS COMES IN VERY HANDY.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "GOOD CASSETTE RECORDER FOR THE PRICE.", "unixReviewTime": 1209686400, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2008"}
