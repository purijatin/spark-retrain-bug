They sat in a box for roughly 20 years until I decided to go ahead and get it over with: time to digitize them. This device was perfect for the project: easy to use, high quality, and priced fairly. I only used its speaker a little in the beginning, but it sounded fine. There's a counter some folks may find useful, and I guess it works... I didn't really pay attention. The device can also record, but I never tested that functionality either. For me, what really mattered was the Line Out / Headphone, which sounded great. Anyway, this was exactly what I needed, and now I've got all those tapes stored safely as audio files.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just what I needed and expected", "unixReviewTime": 1397260800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2014"}
