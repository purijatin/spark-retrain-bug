I have a lot of older recordings, mostly lecture tapes which I tried to convert to MP3 (what a hassle). I found this beautiful cassette player that fit the bill perfectly,  It reminds me of some of the early players that were the first to appear on the market.  Although plastic, it has a very heavy duty feel, all the buttons have that very solid touch to them. I'm not sure how it would sound with music recordings, probably not a good quality for music.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Panasonic Cassette Player", "unixReviewTime": 1380844800, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2013"}
