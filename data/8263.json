I had bought for converting my cassettes to MP3 format and for that it simply isn't up to the task. It only has a single output instead of separate channel RCA jacks for left and right making anything I try and convert go from stereo to monotone. Other than my haste in purchasing, it is a solid unit for the price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Wish I had looked more carefully...", "unixReviewTime": 1353628800, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2012"}
