There is a noticeable difference between AC and DC bias recorders, with AC sounding much clearer.This recorder also cuts off all &#34;bass&#34; sounds completely, and turns up the treble. You'll be able to hear vocals very well but not the drums or bass guitar.I would say this recorder is ideal for voice recordings only.If you're looking for a cassette recorder to copy music from your computer, I would recommend the radio shack desktop cassette recorder, which records with an AC bias, and doesn't completely cut out the bass of songs. It is a bit more expensive though.Amazon was extremely helpful with my return of this item and I promptly got a full refund.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not Suitable For Music Recording", "unixReviewTime": 1382486400, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2013"}
