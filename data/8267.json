I am resigned to perhaps check if I can erase via the other recorders enough so that this one can then re-record on some of those tapes later ...Another flaw is the buttons are very quirky or flimsy -- they tend to look like they are sticking in the down position.I am glad that it does NOT auto-reverse, because that on other recorders has destroyed some tapes by accident .The low cost meant to me that it wasn't worth the hassle to return it even if I didn't want it. And since I need this noise-less feature so much, I am putting up with it.I am currently running it off A/C. I haven't tried off of batteries yet, although that is allowable supposedly.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Did not have an erase head -- so adds parts over instead of replacing them.", "unixReviewTime": 1287187200, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2010"}
