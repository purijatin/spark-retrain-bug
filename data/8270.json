Ashley", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have had two Radio Shack players--which didn't  hold up, unfortunately, so I thought the Panasonic would be better and I expected the same features, i.e.  one called &#34;aux&#34; which I use to connect my radio with a cable to the tape recorder and can tape off programs.  It did not come with that feature so it is not useful for my main purpose. It has a spot for a microphone, but that was not provided.  I didn't care about that anyway.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Doesn't  have features I want/need", "unixReviewTime": 1372464000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2013"}
