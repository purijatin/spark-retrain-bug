It really looks like a shoe box but it does perform extremely well.  It is well worth the money.  I have used it extensively now for 6 months, and it still works well.  It seems to be very durable, it is not fancy but I really don't care I just want it to work.  I was planning another one by now, thinking it would have died by now, but this is not the case.  I think I will go to a coffee shop and buy that Latte I have always wanted with the money I was saving for my new 'shoebox' cassette recorder.  This is a great recorder, very durable.  I give this a 5 star rating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best little recorder I have ever bought", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}
