After having it for a year in which I used it, but not a lot, it now makes a clicking sound when it plays. I'm sure it won't last much longer. I would rather pay more and have an item work. I can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Problems after a year", "unixReviewTime": 1207267200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2008"}
