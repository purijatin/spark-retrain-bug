However if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isn't loud enough. I have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic. And then if you have skype in, forget it because you will never hear the thing ring. But the mic works and it is little money.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Works for recording just fine but not for skype", "unixReviewTime": 1278892800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2010"}
