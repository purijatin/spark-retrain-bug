The unit came with the modem, phone cable, and a small instruction manual.I followed the instruction manual to configure my dial-up connection and email settings.  Everything worked great.  It was also nice to see a chart at the back of the book noting DNS settings for the larger ISP's.I have been using the modem for a little over a week now.  I have had no problems and am very satisfied.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 969580800, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2000"}
