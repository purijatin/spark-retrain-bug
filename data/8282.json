On the TRGPro, you may run into some battery problems, it seems to drain them rather quickly, so be sure to have spares on hand, and don't stay online too long. The increased battery life on the HandEra deals nicely with this problem.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not just for Pocket PCs!", "unixReviewTime": 989366400, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2001"}
