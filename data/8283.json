There's no flashing LEDs, no driver discs; the box contains nothing but the  tiny modem, a phone cord and a brief instruction manual. (There's not even  an AOL disc. They must be slipping.)I was able to get connected in less  than ten minutes, without touching the instruction manual.  Just slip the  modem into the slot, plug in the phone cord, set up a few basic connection  settings, and you're off and running.  If your ISP supports WIndows dialup  networking, it will very probably support this.The manual is the weak  spot; the installation settings it describes on page 7 and 8 may well not  match up with those needed.  Since the dialogs used to configure the Pocket  PC are quite similar to the dialogs used to set up Windows dial-up  networking, you'll want to have your ISP's setup instructions  available.In conclusion, this product is certainly more than worthwhile;  it gives you full-featured dialup capabilities in only a few cubic inches  of space.One final caveat:  This product is also known as the  &quot;Pocket PC Email Expansion Pack&quot;.  If you've just purchased a  Pocket PC, you may find that there's a special offer included for this  expansion pack, and you'll want to check out that offer's pricing and terms  before deciding where to buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It works!
