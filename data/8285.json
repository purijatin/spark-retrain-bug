It plugged right in and i dialed up my earthlink account with no problem. I dont think it could have been easier. The only thing is, i have only used it 3 or 4 times. Whats the point? Pocket IE works well but the view is way to small. Its cool to be able to pull up web pages on your Pocket PC but it looses its coolness pretty quick. Now a wireless modem would be useful but they are a lot more expensive and have additional monthly fees.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works very well but do youreally need it?", "unixReviewTime": 999734400, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2001"}
