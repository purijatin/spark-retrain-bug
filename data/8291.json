Bodao", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I Bought one set to check them out and found they also fit both my four and 10 year old kids. Then I bought 2 more sets just for them as an alternative to the in the ear phones that,(for them,) can be uncomfortable. They reproduce sound well, fit comfortably and have held up well from constant use.  The cord is long if thats important to you, the headband not too tight and is adjustable, and the felt covers on the earpieces are thin but comfortable.And also, Thank you Amazon.com. The convenience of ordering 2 more sets was but a couple of mouseclicks and the earphones were at my door in 2 days.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Safer for my 4 year old", "unixReviewTime": 1318118400, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2011"}
