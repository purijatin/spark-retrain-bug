I can only compare them to my Fata1ity USB PC Headset and my Sony MDR-V6 cans which both produce much better sound but cost way more money.Comfort: Comfortable, I might just be forever sold on over-the-ear vs in-ear headphones because of these. They are light and I forget that i'm wearing them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good, cheap, headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1310342400, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2011"}
