But I mean, even though they sound better than any other headphones under $10, the sound still isn't good enough for serious music listeners.  I'm using them with TeamSpeak3 to communicate with my project team in my project management class for college, and they are so comfortable to use for sometimes 4 hours on end, so I recommend them.  No problems whatsoever.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones at that price", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}
