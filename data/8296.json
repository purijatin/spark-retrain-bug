You know that, that's why you are here.But wow, they do have a really solid sound!My other headphones:Bose QC15Bose In-Ear headphonesAudio-Technica (ATH-M30) [now the wife's]Sony In-EarSony On Ear (Sony MDR-ZX100 ZX)Both Bose and the Audio-Technica are much better headphones...and they should be for the cost. But the sound quality per cost puts the Panasonic way up there. There are plenty of times I don't want my QC15's on...they can be a bit much if I don't really need the noise-cancellation. Same for the Audio-Technica...great, but man are they big/bulky.The in-ear bose produce an amazing sound for an in-ear headphone. But your ears can get a bit tired or sore. That definitely goes for the in-ear Sony's.The Sony OnEar have good sound, but fit funny and aren't comfortable.The Panasonic's fit great, are very comfortable and I can wear them for a while. Additionally, the sound quality is very good. Seriously, I was quite surprised at how good the sound was. I went back and forth between these and the Bose....was impressed. If you aren't an audiophile, these are great! Even if you are (and why are you here reading these reviews)...these are more than acceptable.The only caveat is that in a loud environment, the sound quality fades a bit. Not bad, but if it is loud where you are, you'll want headphones that cover over your ears. If you don't mind the bulk, the Audio-Technica are great for the price.If you have the $$, the QC15's are fantastic. Best noise cancelling headphone I found.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound for such a reasonable price.", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"}
