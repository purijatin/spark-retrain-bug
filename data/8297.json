The headphones themselves are amazing! The bass is really good with songs. BUT, unlike someone else's comment (which swayed my decision to purchase a little), it is not a good size for even kids. I have a really small head and these do not fit me. Plus, I have TMJ and somehow, it squeezes my jaw and it hurts after a few minutes. Ouch. So be aware when buying these that you are sure about the size. They extend quite a bit. So, I think the issue is having a really small head. Although, I am not sure about the other extreme (having a really big head). Ha. I guess the same issue would arise. I have no idea. I wish my head were bigger and my jaw was not so messed up... These are really great headphones otherwise. But, from my experience alone, I have to give a lower rating... Booo.
