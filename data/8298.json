I did not expect this pair of headphones to sound great.  However, when I tried it out with my iPods, the sound quality was amazingly good.  I could hear more sounds clearly than with the earphones from Apple.  The bass response was good: I didn't even need to adjust the equalizer on the iPod to get good bass response.  Even with the iPod's equalizer turned off, the sound was clear and pleasing.  So far, this pair of headphones beats my other headphones in sound quality.The construction of this product does leave much to be desired.  It seems to be on the fragile side.  However, we must remember that this is an inexpensive pair of headphones.Overall, the product is worth more than its price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Sound Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1277424000, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2010"}
