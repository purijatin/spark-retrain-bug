I have a couple of these and then bought some for my mother who asked me to buy another one.  It seems like some stores just do not carry many OR any of these type of headphones and push the ear bud type of headphones.  I don't like the ear buds as they seem to hurt my ears and are always falling out.These are the better working ones in this price range ($4.50-$10) and free shipping.The sound is decent and I don't need state of the art headphones just to listen to some music.  These headphones provide that with minimal cost.  Of course you are NOT going to get excellent high quality sounding headphones when you pay $4.56 and try finding these type of headphones.  Seen similar pairs for $10 -/+.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent headphones for a Decent Price", "unixReviewTime": 1333497600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2012"}
