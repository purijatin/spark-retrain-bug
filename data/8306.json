I already have the Sennheiser PC 31-II which I use daily for Skype & GoToMeeting.First thing that turned me off about the Panny is it just doesn't feel right on my head.  I even tried wearing it backward just to make sure, but of course that didn't work.  I could have kept it even though its sound is a little weak compared to the JVC, but the fit just completely turned me off.The JVC is much louder (like twice as loud), and offer a much better fit, even though the cups are a little small.I ended up returning the Panasonic as it just doesn't feel right on my head.  And will keep the JVC for my DJ purpose, since it fits easily in my 2U rack drawer and its loudness.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a comfortable fit at all.  Sound is clear, but quite weak compared to the JVC HAS160", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}
