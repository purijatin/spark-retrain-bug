Well, I used them myself for the first time this afternoon to listen to some Youtube links and WOW! I was VERY impressed at the high quality sound coming out of such a tiny and (yeah, I'll say it) cheap pair of headphones!With some name brands you can always expect quality and Panasonic is no exception to the rule. The most shocking thing about these great little lightweight headphones is their pricetag!If you're reading this review, don't hesitate and miss out before they wise up and triple the price - grab them NOW! In fact, order 2 so you'll have an extra set around the house. I'm going to do so right now. ;)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wish I'd found these sooner!", "unixReviewTime": 1355529600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2012"}
