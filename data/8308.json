You can still hear traffic coming with them on.  The music sounds fabulous, good bass response and clear highs.  The headphones aren't too tight or too loose. They dry quickly when sweaty. The cord is long and thicker than most cheap headphone cords.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These are great for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1399248000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014"}
