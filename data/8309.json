I purchased 4 new here on Amazon (based on customer reviews and reasonable pricing), because I was looking for that \"just right\" pair to replace them. Love these headphones. This is my favorite of the 4 purchased. Sound is very good, cord length is longer than the others, adjusts nicely to fit your head. Feels decently built, not real cheap.Sound gets 4 1/2 stars. Quality gets 4 stars. Overall I give them a 5 star rating, because the price of under $5 is amazing !!!! Keep in mind these aren't high end $200 head phones, but for $5 it's worth the price. I only had 1 issue, but it seemed to go away. When I first plugged the headphones into my new Sony Xperia Ion they weren't getting a good connection. I had to turn the jack and find the \"sweet spot\" so the sound came through. I unplugged it, plugged it back in and same problem. Bummed, I set them aside. After trying the other 3 headsets, I plugged these in again to check them out once more and the problem was gone. I guess the third time really is the charm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sound !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1346284800, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2012"}
