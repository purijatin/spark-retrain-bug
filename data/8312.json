They are not hugely fantastic and amazing quality. However, they are good enough. You do not want these for moving around a lot with. They ARE good enough for use with laptops, in the car, or laying down. The sound quality surprised me, but I also didn't expect much. It actually sounds decent and the bass is good.Overall:Good for the price of it. If you want a pair that can be a little beat up or chewed on without crying over it, these are it.Not recommended for the gym, jogging, or anything high movement.Good for just about anything else.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not bad.", "unixReviewTime": 1309910400, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2011"}
