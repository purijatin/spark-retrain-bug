This is a very good headphone for the money. If you have Amazon Prime, the shipping is free and it is delivered to you in two days.It is usable even if your iPod Touch (2G and 3G) has a protective case on it.I like the 90-degree headphone plug that makes it less likely to break.The headband is adjustable, and its bass performance is quite good, considering its price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Value and Good Performance", "unixReviewTime": 1314144000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2011"}
