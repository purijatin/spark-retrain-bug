It does record sound, and that can be very handy for an iDevice, but at the cost of the external speakers (if it has one) being shut off. The original reason I bought this was for the use of Skype, but I can't due to the speakers getting shut off. Also, the size can be helpful (not a obstruction), but it is also easily losable.PROS-Records sounds-Compact**CONS-No speaker when in use-CompactIn the end, buy this if you need it for the voice memos, shazam, an certain voice apps, but with other applications, such as Skype,this won't do very well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for what it is", "unixReviewTime": 1315699200, "reviewTime": "09 11, 2011"}
