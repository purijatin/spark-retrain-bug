I'm bought this 7 months ago and they've lasted me without any problems on daily use. I'm buying these again when/if they break. I've seen similar Coby branded ones but they feel so cheap compared to these. Very well worth every penny.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Headphones for Under 20 Dollars", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012"}
