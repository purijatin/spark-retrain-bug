These are not top of the line, noise canceling cover your full ear with padded foam type of ear phones. They are exactly as pictured. They are simple headphones that go over your head, have a little bit of padding and that is about as fancy as they get.However, they seem to do a fine job. They don't seem to distort the sound, they have held up well to lots of use by my children and myself and they are easy to use. They are some of the better head phones of this type available.I would buy them again.Well worth the money.Enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does what I Expected", "unixReviewTime": 1360886400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2013"}
