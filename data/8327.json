He's one of those people who doesn't desire top quality tech, he just wants things to work, so I was looking for something that was cheap but functional for him.As far as the product goes, if you are someone looking for a plain old pair of normal headphones, I see no reason to not buy these Panasonic's.Pros:-They are very lightweight-They are comfortable-Over the ear headphones, so you do not have to worry about them falling out of your ear like a pair of in-ear ones would at this price point.-Sound: for 5 bucks, I was highly impressed. They are not your Bose headphoes, but they work.Cons:-The actual headphone was tad bit smaller then expected.So once again, if you are in the market for a normal pair of headphones that just work, you can NOT go wrong with these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 bucks?!?! Great Value for what I was looking for!", "unixReviewTime": 1329782400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012"}
