The bass is exaggerated a bit to overcome the open design. Due to this the midrange suffers a bit, but you can hardly fault these headphones for this at this price. These are made for on the go listening and that they do superbly. You can easily hear your music as well as the environment around you. It would be difficult to fault these at four times the price. Buy and enjoy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Cans For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 1362009600, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2013"}
