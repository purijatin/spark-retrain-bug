Stanton", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "My RP-HT21 headphones came in today's mail and I've been listening to it for the past hour with a smile on my face.  Is it possible that such low-cost headphones can produce such a full, realistic sound?  The answer is YES!  I've been looking for some new headphones to replace the stock earbuds on my SanDisk Clip Zip, not because the earbuds sound bad - they produce a very good sound - but because I found them to be uncomfortable.  I was told that a certain brand of earbuds were comfortable and sounded very good, so I bought them and was very disappointed in the sound, especially the booming bass.  As I mainly listen to classical music I wanted something well balanced, not bass heavy.  I noticed that over 430 people reviewed the RP-HT21 headphones and gave it a great overall rating.  I decided to take a chance on it and I'm very glad I did.  Not only does it sound terrific on soft and loud passages (and I like my classical music loud) but it's very comfortable as well.  I'm sure there are lightweight headphones available that have better sound quality, but not at anywhere near the price of the RP-HT21's.  This is an incredible buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Sound, Great Bargain", "unixReviewTime": 1319587200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2011"}
