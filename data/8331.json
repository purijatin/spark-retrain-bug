I have tried headphones costing 5 to 10 times more and you are not going to get any better sound quality. Probably have to get into the well over $50 range to get any noticable improvement. Everything sounds rich, there is even adequate bass.What I don't personally like about them is the shape of the headphones. They are a little too thick and a little too narrow for my preferences. However after now having used the headphones for the past 4 months, the feel is fine. It take some getting use to though. And unlike other headphones I have bought, these are still going strong and possibly even sounding better.Great choice to take to work, exercise, or even around the house. They are not noise cancelling per se which I like since at work I like to hear everything around me also. But even though they do not cancel noise, make no mistake they don't take much to drive them so you can get good volume from them with a phone/MP3 player. Really good value for the money but also just good sounding headphones no matter what you spent on them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Astounding sound quality for the price but not great comfort", "unixReviewTime": 1291939200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2010"}
