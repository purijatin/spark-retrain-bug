I am not an audiophile by any means but my husband, who is more conscious of sound quality, was also impressed with them and so I ordered a second pair for him.  I'm happy to add a five star review to this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprisingly good", "unixReviewTime": 1305936000, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2011"}
