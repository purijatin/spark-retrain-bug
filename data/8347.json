I have tried several types of ear buds and they always end up hurting my ears.  I tried other small headphones but the all sounded like crap until I found these.  To me they sound like $50 headphones for less than $5.  I ordered 2 extra pairs just in case I lose or break one of the pairs I ordered the first time.  You simply can't go wrong with these.  And no I do NOT work for panasonic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1258588800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2009"}
