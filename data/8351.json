They're lightweight and the sound they put out is quite substantial.  Not super-high end audio-snob substantial, but good enough to watch an action movie or edit some footage without costing an arm and a leg. I like the feeling of not having to baby them. So far they've held up, but if I do break them, I'm not too worried. $6.44 and I'm back in business 2 days later.  5/5 would recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "YES!", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}
