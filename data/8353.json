Brown", "helpful": [0, 2], "reviewtext": "I tried two pairs of these headphones from Amazon and had to return both as \"defective.\"It sounded like there may have been a short in each pair of these headphones. When plugged into my iphone or ipad, the volume was horrible, as if at the end of a long tunnel, and when twisting the plug, tons of static blasted in my ears at full volume, with an occasional clip of music also at full volume. I could never get the plug in a place where the music came through at full volume.I have to believe this is the headphones as the stock microphone/headphones that came with the iphone work fine as well as a pair of v-mode earbuds. They work fine with no static no matter how much I twist the plug.Considering all the positive reviews for these, I have to wonder if they recently underwent a design change and/or I got headphones from a defective batch. Either way, I'm giving up on them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Unusable on iPhone or iPad", "unixReviewTime": 1381536000, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2013"}
