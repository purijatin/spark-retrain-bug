I did not need anything super-expensive or top-rate audiophile quality because I thought they might get overly-harsh wear, being under my head while I lie down. For the price they deliver decent sound. I'm not extremely picky about excellent sound quality, but I am a video technician and know good sound from bad. If you position these on your head properly so the phones are directly over your ear wells, the sound is quite good. This for not a lot of money. I bought these at the same time as some other purchases to take advantage of Super Saver shipping, so shipping cost was free.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1339632000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2012"}
