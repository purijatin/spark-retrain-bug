And these are only around 5 bucks and sound like 20 dollar headphones.And the speaker shape is not round like regular 5 dollar headphones, it is long to naturally fit your ear.If you want headphones that have deep base like this, and a very low price, then you should buy this product.And I like gambling with 5 dollars and have it not work in 6 months for example, than pay 20 or 30 bucks andhave it not work in 6 months.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Deep base, sounds like 20 dollar headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1323388800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2011"}
