I wanted something light weight and comfortable, and these fit the bill.  I have a high quality Heil microphone/headphones headset that I use for voice work which are comfortable for the most part, but the Panasonic product is better for listening only.  Sure, the audio quality is not as good, but they make up for it in being lighter in weight and they work just fine to help me here the code signals through the airwaves noise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very comfortable for extended wear", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}
