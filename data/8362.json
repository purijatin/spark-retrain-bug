My ears are pretty delicate and I had a slight irritation for a day or two and then nothing -- totally comfortable. They're so light and comfortable you can forget you're wearing them. Unfortunately, the sound is not like $80 headphones, at least the ones I have. But, for the price, they are unbeatable.As others have mentioned, if you're using these at a desktop computer, you might need one of those mini-plug extender cables (female on one end, male on the other), because the cable is only of the MP3 player type size. The package says \"Comfort fit, confortable.\" LOL. Maybe that typo is why they are so cheap?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love 'em, but sonically not great, except for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1343520000, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2012"}
