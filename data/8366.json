My plan for these headphones was for using while outside working in the lawn with mowers and other machinery running.  I realized that they wouldn't silence other sounds in the way that the much heavier, fully padded/insulated headphones do...but I had expectations of them being able to deaden outside noises as much or more than regular ear buds.  I was reluctant to wear the heavier headphones that completely surround your ears while outside working since I didn't want to completely tune out what was happening around me.It didn't take long to come to the conclusion that they offer nothing at all in the way of outside sound reduction.  The in-your-ear buds cover outside noise better than these do.  So, I thought...oh well, I'll just use them for regular indoor listening.  They're certainly comfortable enough.  But, they don't stay on...or at least they don't stay on me.  I have to remain perfectly motionless or else they slide off my ears.The sound clarity is decent for the price.  The cable is plenty long at about 4.5.'  The XBS port is supposed to offer increased bass response.  I maybe noticed a bit of difference there; but it's of little help when the headphones won't stay in place on my ears.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "They didn't work well for me...good thing they were cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1381276800, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2013"}
