Mantis \"Exposed\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have been using earbuds for some time on my walks and it has bothered me that whatever earbuds I use seem to produce a high pitched sound from my walking movement. I suspect it is the rubber material rubbing against my eardrum. Whatever that is it bothers me. So, I thought for a change I would try a headphone set as I don't have any extra noises affecting my computer headphone set when I move around.This set is very inexpensive and I was concerned the quality would be low at best. To my surprise I find these headphones excellent with one caveat. I wish they could be a bit louder - maybe 20% or so. Could be the function of my Sansa but the earbuds get plenty loud.Otherwise I'm pleased as punch and enjoy my walks ever so much more with great sounds without squeeking noises thrown in.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressed with this Inexpensive Headphone set.", "unixReviewTime": 1348099200, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2012"}
