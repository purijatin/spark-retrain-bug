Ferrer", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I would have given this pair of headphones five stars, if it were not for the fact that, five stars is hard to give for an audio product that costs less (in some cases) than a value meal!That said, This is definitely the best cheap pair of headphones I have ever owned! The sound is great, given the price point. We'll see about the &#34;last-ability&#34;, but this is a great little product, and if you're looking for an everyday, portable, decent sound quality pair of phones - look no further. These are it. Buy them. They really do sound very good for what they are.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If not for the obvious...", "unixReviewTime": 1390780800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2014"}
