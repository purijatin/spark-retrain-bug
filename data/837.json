It's been trouble-free up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files (~29GB) from my HP laptop to my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  I've also purchased compatible SD micro cards for my Samsung Galaxy III cell phones which have worked out better than the Kingston cards that I had originally purchased.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SanDisk Outstanding Performance", "unixReviewTime": 1401148800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014"}
