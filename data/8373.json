I listen to music and TV for hours.But considering the name Panasonic and reputation of the company, I read the reviews and was impressed by the general agreementamong Amazon buyers that these are really great head phones. So I bought a pair for myself, and I must say that I am impressed. Not onlydo they pick up stereo, but they pick up such options as smart sound on digital play back on your computer DVD player. And the add onprice when you buy $25 worth of merchandise is outstanding. My wife tried these and loves them too. I just bought another set for her and am expecting delivery today. Packaging and service from the seller are excellent too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Light and easy on your ears with dynamite sound", "unixReviewTime": 1354579200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2012"}
