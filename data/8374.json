However, with all but dollar store quality headphones, I can get all the noise I need. These don't produce sufficient volume pushing them close to the sound level of $1 items. When I do jack up the MP3 player to near its limits, draining the battery, these produce a respectful, smooth sound way beyond their price. If you don't mind upping the volume by about 50%, these are a solid deal. For me, these won't replace any earbuds or headphones that I already had.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not very loud", "unixReviewTime": 1347408000, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2012"}
