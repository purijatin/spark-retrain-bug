They break expensive and cheap things equally so I didn't want to spend even $30 on a set of headphones.  These aren't just cheap, they work fairly well too.  Certainly much better than $5 headphones should work.  Great shipping fast delivery as always.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the money, hard to beat", "unixReviewTime": 1339718400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2012"}
