I start looking around for some that I could get for a throwaway price and I come across these. I look at the description and I think it's too good to be true. But, it's less than five dollars (at least when I bought it) so I buy it. The first time I put them on, i don't believe what I'm hearing. I have never heard sound that good coming out of something this small and this cheap. Even my dad was impressed by it, and he's a professional mixer. If the price stays this good, I may get more of these the next time I need to replace my headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A steal", "unixReviewTime": 1251676800, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2009"}
