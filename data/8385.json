They sound ok and make a good lightweight bedtime headphone.  They are so lightweight they slip off my head if I try to wear them during normal daytime activity.  The XBS Port is very useful as an extra XBS Port.  My XBS  really needed an extra Port. Now I can XBS Wherever I want.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port", "unixReviewTime": 1365811200, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2013"}
