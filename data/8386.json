I go through at least 10 pairs of headphones a year, they never leave my neck. I listen to music at all times, accept in school of course. I prefer headphones that increase the bass and cancel sound around you (noise-canceling). These headphones are PERFECT, meaning that you can really hear the bass and not much else around you. The vocals are really good, and the sound comes through very clearly. I have had them for a month so far and they haven't disappointed me. The only thing is that they are made pretty big, and even the lowest setting is really long. I would not recommend them for running, I've tried and they have fallen off. I would stick to earbuds. But for dancing around the house, working, or on a long car ride, these headphones are definitely worth more then the price they are asking for. I am very impressed with the price (it was great to find a good pair of headphones under $15) and the sound quality overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Bass Okay Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1348358400, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2012"}
