I never listen to rock, hip-hop, rap, or the sounds of train wrecks. Bass to me means tight, deep, sonorous, well-intonated double bass (i.e., contrabass, upright acoustic bass), not the moo-moo-burp-moo boomy, muddy bass that generally comes out of rock bass guitars. These cheap little headphones deliver the kind of bass I want to hear. The mid and treble instruments sound great, too. And they're comfortable; I could wear them for hours at a time. I personally prefer a one-sided cord, but that's not likely to be found in a cheap headphone. In any case, I would gladly give that up for phones of this quality at this price.I've been using Sennheiser PX 100 phones with iTunes on my computer for years, and these Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones compare very favorably at a fraction of the price. You need to adjust the volume up somewhat compared to the PX 100s, which is easy enough to do, and after I do that I'm not sure I could tell them apart. The RP-HT21s don't fold up, but I use them at several locations around my home so that doesn't matter.These headphones are a steal at the price. Get 'em before they disappear. I and others will be ordering backups.PS: I'm not hard on my headphones. If these don't hold up over time, I'll adjust my rating downward, but how much time do to want for this tiny price?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good, tight, intonated bass--not boomy mud.", "unixReviewTime": 1342656000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2012"}
