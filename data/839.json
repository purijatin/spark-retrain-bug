Suddenly even thought the Storage in settings showed the card with used and free space, no app could find any files on it. Had to dismount, remove it and reinsert it for it to work, BUT it is erratic! While in the middle of playing mp3s on it, all the files disappeared.. This is happening over and over. Very disappointing!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worked for about 50 days.", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}
