For the record, though, these RP-HT21s are slightly below par compared to the similar headphones that came with my 2003 Panasonic SL-SX420 MP3 CD player, sounding a bit less strong and detailed. Also, the foam padding flaked off quicker, and I find the earbuds to be angled inward a few degrees too far, falling short of a perfect fit.So yes, there is some degree of variance in basic headphones, even of the same size and brand.  Undemanding ears should find them perfectly fine, though, and if they fit you better than me, it's easy to call them a good deal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "OK for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1258848000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2009"}
