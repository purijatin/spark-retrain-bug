I like to save any applications I can to it to save room on my device.  Worked great for a couple of months after that.  Then since yesterday, it just stopped reading and started saying damaged card and try to format.  I formatted it, and it still wont read the sd card.  This was a horrible waste of my money.  I am very upset.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Very dissapointed", "unixReviewTime": 1398643200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2014"}
