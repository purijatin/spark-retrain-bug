Unfortunately I was disappointed by sound reproduction of theses headphones. The sound is very weak compared to quite a few other equally priced headphones. If I press them on my ears, then I get a mediocre sound. It lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly. I got what I paid for.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Sound quality matches the price", "unixReviewTime": 1319673600, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2011"}
