I bought these for our girls K and 2nd grade supply lists because of the great price an reviews. Unbelievably, these headphones made it through an entire year of school and have followed our girls into 1st and 3rd grade! If somehow they make it another year I will update this review but we are blown away by how durable these phones are.Pros+ Unbelievably durable, it they can survive a year with a kindergartener they can survive anything+ Sound is great for the price. Of course there are far better sounding headphones, but at less than $5 the sound is a real achievement+ Crazy good value+ Good surface area on top of band perfect for a name labelCons?- If the price climbs to $10 then I will try to come up with a con, but at this price, I can't fault these phones at allThese are great phones for the price and perfect for kids, I highly recommend them as do hundreds of other satisfied reviewers", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for back-to-school lists", "unixReviewTime": 1346025600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2012"}
