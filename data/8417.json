He's only nine years old so they didn't have to be Sennheiser's. At nine years old he's not very discerning about sound quality. But I still wanted to get him something fairly decent and not some total junk. I read the reviews on these Panasonics and they seemed to be just what I was looking for. When I received them I was surprised how nice the packaging was. They looked like they would cost a lot more than four bucks. After he got them on Christmas morning I wanted to see what they sounded like so I pulled some music up on his new tablet. I was blown away at how good they sounded for a four dollar pair of headphones. I doubt there's any other 'phones in this price range that could compare with these Panasonics. Once in a while you find something that's really worth more than it's price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lowest Priced Decent Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1360281600, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2013"}
