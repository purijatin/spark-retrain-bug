Unfortunately, the connection to my Sansa Clip+ isn't great.  It's the only set that has an L Shaped plug and I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but if I move around at all there is static or loss of volume or both.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Touchy!", "unixReviewTime": 1304899200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2011"}
