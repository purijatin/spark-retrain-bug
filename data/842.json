I used this adapter to power my HP laptop and I used it's built-in USB port to charge my Blackberry Bold, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch with no problems at all. The built-in lights are really handy. The power light lets you know it's plugged into a working AC wall plug. I found that not all plugs in the Chicago and Houston airports are working, so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet. The second, USB, light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the USB device. For example; when my Blackberry was plugged in and recharging, the light glowed somewhat dimmly, but when I made a call, the light glowed more brightly. So you can tell when you have a good connection to your USB device.Overall, it's well built and easy to operate. I'll be keeping this in my travel bag.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worked great", "unixReviewTime": 1269129600, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2010"}
