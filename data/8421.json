I've been using them as gifts for birthdays, Christmas, etc.  I know people think I shelled out more than that.  When listening to music and especially Celtic Woman videos the sound comes across so clear, vibrant and full I am awestruck.  I've owned more expensive headphones.  My current &#34;good&#34; set cost 20X that on sale and they are better in every way than these.  Except in weight.  My &#34;good&#34; set has very linear response that is awesome too and the HT-21 is base heavy.  That's not always a bad thing.  I can hear the drums and the base line without blowing my eardrums out with the rest of it.  I like that.  The cord is also nicely long, substantial and has an angle plug.  It just doesn't get any better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Sound and Fantastic Price", "unixReviewTime": 1365811200, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2013"}
