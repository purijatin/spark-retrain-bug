Was sick of the Sony headphones everywhere all the time due to the mediocre audio and bass of their consumer lines. When I saw these branded Panasonic it felt like the key to potential jackpot due to the price and brand. And lo and behold what powerful sound from such light weight low budget priced head phones. Definitely fatter/deeper bass than many big headphones 10x the price.Please forget scullcandy, beats by Dr Dre and other recent frauds. This is Panasonic and the sound of these highly affordable headphones show why it's such killer brand.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "it's panasonic", "unixReviewTime": 1346630400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2012"}
