And the price kept going up and up, $8, $12, $15, $19.  Finally I started buying replacement pads at a wholesale telecom headset supplier online for $0.75 per pad, i could refurbish those headphones.  But now, the sliding portions of the headbands are breaking.After reading the reviews, I decided to buy 3x sets, one for a car DVD player, one for my backpack (use it with laptop, occasionally), and one for a spare.  They just arrived this morning and I could not be more delighted.These produce excellent bass and excellent high-frequency sound.  If there is any error in the frequency response, the midrange might be low by 1 dB or something, but that's just my first impression.  They are comfortable to wear and I am still trying them out, I can't believe my great luck.  For only $12, I got not just one headphone this time, but 3x headphones, with free shipping (I ordered other goods at the same time.)  I couldn't be happier for these headphones, at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beats anything else under $20.00", "unixReviewTime": 1271808000, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2010"}
