I bought these because I'd heard rumors that Panasonic makes good, and CHEAP, headphones. If these cans are any indication those rumors are true. Their sound, especially considering the price, while not perfect by any means is quite good. And the comfort factor is also good, at least for my head. The ear pads appear to be easy to replace, but the cord is not. But who cares, because for the money a new pair of headphones can be bought. So if your pet lynx chews the cord off, or you neighbor's anteater eats the ear pads you can just buy a new pair of these headphones instead of fiddling around replacing parts. So, the little Panasonics get five stars from me because their price to performance ratio is spot-on, unlike some very expensive, and underwhelming headphones which I've run into.Would I buy the headphones again? You bet you anteater I would.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not bad, not great....but...not bad sound, fit, but a bang-on price.", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}
