The sound quality and fit around the ear are both nothing special as sound leaks out through them as they don't have a tight fit [as designed].However, they get the job done as a cheap set of 'extra' headphones just to have lying around the house.  I'm impressed with the durability given the price.Overall quality for the money is outstanding, but overall quality is only so-so.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "very nice for cheap headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1292371200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2010"}
