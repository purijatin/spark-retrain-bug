I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well, the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly. Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer's power cord plug into the AC receptacle. Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it.  Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. However, the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged. Also, another switch was shown in the instruction diagram (I don't remember what it was supposed to be for) that wasn't on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices. Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts, great product and VERY cost effective.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good item", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}
