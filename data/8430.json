These headphones are stunning. I've owned several pairs of \"lightweight\" phones over the years, -but these are exceptional -especially as open-air designs.  I've now purchased several for friends.  I'm also a Sony MDR-V6 enthusiast (& that should tell you about my taste for exceptional phones).  I'm generally not easily impressed. These Panasonic phones were a pleasing exception!  If Panasonic marketing is reading; --They'd be well advised to make these phones into a similar model with a boom-microphone for skype-type communications.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stunning sound for this price!", "unixReviewTime": 1338768000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2012"}
