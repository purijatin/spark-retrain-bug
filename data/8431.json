It's light and sounds great. I have noise-cancelling headphones but you begin to feel them on your hair and pressing against your ears after an hour or so, I've since switched back to these and they feel awesome for my purposes (smooth jazz, no bass). I was going to purchase some Audio Technica's for 100 but I'll stick with these free ones. And for the price, that's a no-brainer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Only better option would be to get them for free", "unixReviewTime": 1345593600, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2012"}
