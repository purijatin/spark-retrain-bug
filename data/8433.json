Works with my computer, my cd players, even works with my cell phone except it does not have an answer button.  The sound is very good considering the price you pay, and they are lightweight and comfortable.  Even gave one to my husband to use with his portable ham radio.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best cheap headphones you can buy", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013"}
