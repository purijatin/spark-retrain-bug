For what these cost you absolutely cannot go wrong , and they are better than many that cost a lot more.  The sound is clear, good bass response,  and they're very lightweight and comfortable.  Very highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}
