Violette", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Just received these and trying them with Poweramp on my droid phone, they're a great set of headphones for the price.  Placido never sounded so good.  Very light weight, comfortable fit; won't fly off with a head shake.  Volume's nearly twice what it was with the cheapo airline set I was using 'til these arrived.  Glad I bought two sets.  Five stars for these more-than-adequate, bargain-priced headphones.  If they last me a year or two, I'll be happy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sweet Set", "unixReviewTime": 1330041600, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2012"}
