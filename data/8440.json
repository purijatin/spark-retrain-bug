This Panasonic is by far the best set of phones I have ever had. The highs and lows sound great.  The bass is perfect with no distortion. Even the wire seems to be a better gauge. Has a very good feel around my head. Nice and snug on the ears. Most of the other phones I have are Sony. They are good too, but not as good as this Panasonic. I think I will need to buy a few more as back up just in case I loose one.UPDATE 8/05/10 --- Still using the same headphones & they still sound as good as the day I first got them.  I bought an extra back-up pair just in case I break this pair.UPDATE 3/30/11 --- It's hard to believe but I'm still using the same headphones & they still sound as good as the day I first got them. I bought 2 back up pairs just in case amazon stops selling these. My Dad took one pair but I still have the other. I use these almost daily, except weekends. I have dropped them many times and have accidently yanked on wires going into the ear pieces. Still works great. I don't know how anyone could give these a 1 star!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound", "unixReviewTime": 1234915200, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2009"}
