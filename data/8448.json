Good sound, throwaround headphones. They break, you won't be too worried, but the price is so low you won't be looking to return for a refund.They are very comfortable, the headband is done well, and is comfy for being plastic. They are adjustable, and should fit most of everyone.There is bass present, pretty strong, but not overpowering and muddy like Beats by dre. An equalizer might help.For the price.. I can't recommend anything else.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little budget headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1326758400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2012"}
