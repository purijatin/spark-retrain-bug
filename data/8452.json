For the price you pay, the product is great. The sound quality is good, and its no big deal if you break it because its so inexpensive. The one thing I don't like about these is that sometimes your hair will get stuck on the frame. When you try to take it off, it will also take a piece of hair with it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good price for replacable headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1280707200, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2010"}
