Are they the best headphones out there?  Absolutely not but they're not advertised as that anyway.  They're not noise cancelling but I've purchased 4 sets so far because they are a great deal.  I use them while at work in an office and I can still hear the firearm and the sound quality is great for use with my smartphone or the work PC.  If you don't want to spend a lot of money you'll be very happy with these headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1395446400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2014"}
