Looking for a replacement I came across the Panasonic RP-HT21 and figured for $5 how can I lose. They're OK - non-flexible headphones sit funny so I had to turn them around to use. Uncomfortable after wearing for more then an hour. Like the title says - spend $5 and you get $5 worth of headphones.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1321574400, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2011"}
