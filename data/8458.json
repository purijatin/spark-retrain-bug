I found the sound quality of these inexpensive headphones surprisingly good, with a lot of warmth and a good amount of bass, although the output power is on the low side, which means lower volume than more expensive headphones. At least this is so with my iPod Classic. All these observations are for EQ being off.This low power is actually perfect for the kids' hearing! Now they can't hurt themselves by cranking up the volume on their Sony walkman players, even with the volume limiter turned off. I just bought another pair for myself to use at bedtime. For outdoors, though, I stick with my Sony earbuds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good sound quality if a bit low in volume, perfect for kids!", "unixReviewTime": 1344211200, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2012"}
