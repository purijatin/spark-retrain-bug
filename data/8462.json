I am very sensitive to bad sound.  I cannot believe how good these headphones are.They are better than headphones I have used costing 10 times as muchnot only soundwise but also comfortwise.  These are amazingly comfortableand very light on my head.  I cannot stand headphones that make me feellike my head is in a vise.  They also allow reasonable outside sounds tocome thru, like when the nurse calls me into the doctor's room. and youcan hear your stop when riding the bus.Pros:  Great bass, highs and a sweet natural sound. What more could you want?  How about picking up sounds you never even heard before on your oldheadphones.  Great comfort.  I'll probably hit the plastic band with a bitof hairdryer to soften and bend the plastic to make them even a wee bit looser on my head (I said I'm very critical).  Don't do this while its attached to your mp3 player.  Price under $5.00 including shipping? They fit perfectly in thelittle camera bag I carry my mp3 player in (the Sandisk Fuze 4gb player).Also, the accessories I got for my Sandisk were amazingly cheap and included shipping.Cons:  NoneBottom line:  Don't hesitate, buy these at once.  You Might even want to order an extra pair at that price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An amazing bargain with superb sound!", "unixReviewTime": 1266278400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2010"}
