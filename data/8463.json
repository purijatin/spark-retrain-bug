You will hear your music and every other noise around you.  That means they're great for outdoor activity awareness but less-than-great if you want to jam out any other time.I make sure I set my ipod equalizer on deep and the headphones just kick.  It's also good to know they have good, heavy drivers  in them that surpass even the $50 sets. (I know, I've got some).The advice I got was get two.  I did.  Your friends will fall in love with them too!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasantly surprised", "unixReviewTime": 1372377600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2013"}
