I am happy with longer cord length.  The cord, frame and phones are sturdy and durable.  The comfort and sound quality are OK, but not as good as my notebook headphone set that is ten times more expensive.  These Panasonic headphones are inexpensive solution and they are worth the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great but Coarse", "unixReviewTime": 1321228800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2011"}
