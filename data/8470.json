The foam padding over the earbuds make a functional cushion for the ear.  When I use these earphones, it is usually to watch hulu.com (TV) from my computer. I have the volume on my computer turned to medium and low. On this setting, other people in the room cannot hear what I am listening to. It serves it's purpose. I recommend the earbuds!
