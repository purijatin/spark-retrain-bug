Denick", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I paid something like $4.50 for these headphones, and that INCLUDED the shipping from the vendor that was selling them through Amazon. To put this in perspective, I would have to pay more than that for ONE BEER at the local pub, and that investment would disappear into my belly in a matter of moments. These headphones, on the other hand, have already provided me with countless hours of entertainment (and they're calorie free)!There is no better deal out there for comfortable, quality headphones. I've used these almost every day for the past couple of months, for any length of time between 2 and 6 hours while at work. I've had the opportunity to borrow high end headphones from friends and coworkers, like Bose and Beats. Are the Beats better than these four dollar headphones? Yes, of course they are. But they are not 40x better (roughly the extra amount of money you would have to pay for them)! I use headphones all the time, I'm hard on them, and they all will eventually break. I would much rather replace these $4 headphones (I already ordered another pair, to have on hand), than ship off my $300 headphones for service.And they're not junk, not by any means. The sound quality is excellent (for the average listener, like me), and the bass is very, very good. Build quality is excellent (especially when you consider the price), with a thick cord and nothing that feels flimsy. Unless if you're a serious audiophile with money to burn, you can't go wrong with these headphones :) Enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheaper than a pint of beer at the pub (and they last longer, too!)", "unixReviewTime": 1340409600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2012"}
