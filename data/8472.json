They are cheap because they are cheaply made.  Too big for any of the 5 of us in my family and the ear pieces are too small to fit over an average adult's ear.  Don't be misled by these other positive reviews, I would be surprised if you were happy with these headphones.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Two Big \"Ears\" Down", "unixReviewTime": 1325894400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2012"}
