I'd been using cheap headphones for years, until about a year ago, when I bought a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-G1 for $30 that sound great, but are too uncomfortable to wear for a 2 hour movie. I'm not sure these headphones sound quite as good as the RP's, but the difference is less dramatic than you'd think, and for $4, you'll never find headphones in the same league. I believe that all but the most discerning audiophiles will find that these headphones are as good as they'll need for just about every imaginable use. Save these in your cart and use as a filler item next time you find something you're ready to buy that just falls short of the $25 free shipping threshold, and you won't be sorry!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Poor man's Sennheisers", "unixReviewTime": 1272931200, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2010"}
