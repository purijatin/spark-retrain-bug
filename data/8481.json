Lack a bit in the highs and lows but thats not what I purchased these for. Have grandkids and great grandkids and inexpensive headphones to keep around the house for their use is tough. These are ideal, they work great for me for my audio book,s and since my hearing isn't as sensitive as it once was, the sound is fine for my music.If one of the youn'uns breaks a set of these, I'm not out of a large amount of cash.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1359849600, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013"}
