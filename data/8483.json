I just watched a movie wearing these headphones and they really brought the audio of the movie to life!  Truly impressive.  The specs say the frequency response of these headphones is 16 Hz - 22 kHz.  That's an audio range that extends both below and above the range of the average human ear!  And they sure seem to live up to these specs.  I found them quite comfortable to wear for the duration of the movie.  I would definitely recommend you give these a try!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}
