They are wonderful for people who don't like ear buds or just people who want a set of decent headphones for a low price.  Nice quality and last forever.  There are no cons to these at all.  You can't get anything better for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great quality, no problems", "unixReviewTime": 1298160000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2011"}
