And for $5?  If these broke, and they were selling them for $25, I'd buy another set.  May pick up a few extra's just in case.  The base is more than adequate, they're snug, but not too tight on my head, and are great for running.  Ear buds don't stay in my ears, at least the 4 different pair I have tried don't, so these are a great solution for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow.  Really impressive.", "unixReviewTime": 1259971200, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2009"}
