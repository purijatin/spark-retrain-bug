I use it to listen to mp3's when I am at work, but I'm surprised at the description and some of the reviews which say this has enhanced bass response. In fact, I found the treble response to be good, and not the bass. I normally have the EQ settings for typical classic rock - a distended V, which should enhance the bass, but I didnt see the enhanced bass.The other shortcoming was the length of the cord. I had to buy an extender so I could comfortably move around on my chair in my cube at work, when connected to the PC.Anyway, I am happy with it, but the cost was doubled when I bought the extender.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Value for money - but increased bass ?", "unixReviewTime": 1248912000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2009"}
