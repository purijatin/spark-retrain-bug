This works well for that. At five samoleans how can you go wrong? And the headband design is easy for him to put on and fits his head okay. But personally as an adult I would not want to use these for music. Overall they sound quite poor, especially on fine acoustic or classical music. Though on lighter fare like pop music, the bass is surprising strong and pleasant. I'm not sure how the bass can be so wonderful, yet the overall fidelity sound like a tinny AM radio. I could probably use these for tasks or as a study aid, like for spoken language lessons, audio books, transcription, listening to lecture recordings - I guess anything but good music.If you need something cheap and easy to take on and off, and fine to throw in your bag and not worry about losing, these are for you. If you want decent sound, not really.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "cheap, excellent bass, but poor sound for music", "unixReviewTime": 1379980800, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2013"}
