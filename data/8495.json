They are comfortable and sound great. I like the right angle jack. I have others including Sennheisers that sit close by, but the Panasonics win the competition for the sound to comfort ratio given that I like to have some ambient noise coming through (my room is quiet, I like to know when someone is at the door). If they died next month I would likely get another pair, it's very tough to beat the $5 price - even though they are now an \"add on\" item and they used to be straight up Prime, the price has only gone up 12 cents - that's life.Your needs and mileage may differ.hth, high", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "19 months and still my favs.", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
