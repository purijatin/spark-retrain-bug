After that, the right channel went dead.This wasn't one week of grueling, sweating, working-out-in-the-gym torture. This was one week of \"old guy sitting very, very still in a chair listening to music.\" And still...PSHHT!!! The darn thing crapped out on me.For the price, there's no point in trying for a return...nor much hope that I can make a repair. So even though they didn't cost much, it hurts to be adding them to the landfill. Other reviews indicate that this has been an ongoing problem with these headphones. I'm really disappointed that Panasonic couldn't add another fraction of a penny's worth of rubber to reinforce the cord and protect the wiring.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Great For the One-Eared.
