For kicks, I tried them on my Macbook playing back lossless audio tracks from iTunes.Turns out these diminutive headphones sound really good, much better than I expected given their price.  Not exactly hi-fi, but nothing's missing, either.  Tight enough lows, no edginess to the highs.  And they weigh almost nothing so they're comfortable for long periods, even over glasses.For the money, it's pretty hard to go wrong with the Panasonics.  Cheap headphones for the kids, an upgrade to the cheesy phones the airlines hand out, or a decent option for iTunes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bought for the kids but now I'm using them", "unixReviewTime": 1370131200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2013"}
