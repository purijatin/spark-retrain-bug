They have sensitivity 97dB, which is not enough, other phones I have with 105dB sensitivity - are OK with mobiles.  Sound quality is OK, but nothing special, but for this price they are great. These phones do not provide good isolation, which is OK for me when I'm on bicycle and need to hear outside sounds, but for public transport, and other noisy places they are useless.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good phones but low ooutput", "unixReviewTime": 1391644800, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2014"}
