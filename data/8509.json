The quality of sound is good and very clear, and the volume of my iPod does not seem to impede the output of sound. Most of the time, I wear the Panasonic lightweight headphones while running/jogging, and it fits snugly on my head, making it perfect for exercising. The cord is quite long, so I usually wrap it around the iPod to make it fit better in my pockets.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1348617600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2012"}
