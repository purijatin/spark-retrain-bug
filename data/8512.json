The kind of sideways plug works quite well with where I have to plug them in to the Kindle. At the bottom, kind of stays out of the way.The price for these headphones is just great for what I wanted them for, and for that I get very good sound. They are also very comfortable. You can hardly tell you are wearing these, they are so comfortable.I highly recommend these headphones for casual use (may not be so great for an audiophile), for the price is so good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Can't Beat These For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 1338595200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2012"}
