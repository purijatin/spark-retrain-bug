I've always liked their full sound, so when I changed over to an mp3 player, it was no surprise that I found them to sound the best for that format too. I am one of those people that can't keep earbuds in my ears, they always fall out and/or don't sit right in my ear and sound \"tinny\". Anyway, as the old ones are beginning to wear out I found these new ones and decided to purchase. They have the same full, rich sound as my old ones and at a price that makes them disposable anymore. My one complaint is they are using thinner foam that decreases their comfort level somewhat. Overall I highly recommend them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Headphones for an MP3 player", "unixReviewTime": 1224028800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2008"}
