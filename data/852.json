Now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage, the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter, and this one fits the bill.  It's very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit - no more lost parts! - and it has the added benefit of a USB port for charging MP3 players & the like.  Add to that a super-reasonable price, and I don't know how you could ask for more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well designed", "unixReviewTime": 1266710400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2010"}
