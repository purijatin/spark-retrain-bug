I didn't expect them to be so nice for the price. The sound quality is incredible. They are very durable and feel great on my head. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I ordered a few more for the kids. I wish that everything this cheap was so well-made.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones for the Money!", "unixReviewTime": 1324857600, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2011"}
