I typically replace them every year or so since the perspiration from my walking tends to cause the foam ear pieces to deteriorate.  This pair was within my budget and I opted to give it a try.  Very comfortable fit since the ear pieces swivel nicely about the head piece.  The sound quality is also excellent...bright treble and midrange and full bass. Great value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very comfortable and good sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1392422400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2014"}
