I'm use to the big, bulky kind and the little ear plugs.  I hate the ear plugs, but traveling on a bus or walking down the street with an MP3 and the big ones isn't exactly any better.  These are.They are lightweight and have an awesome sound quality.  I couldn't believe I could have my volume on the lowest setting (on my laptop) and it still be too loud.  Another reviewer mentioned the bass.  It is astounding.  I was so use to my big and bulky (and old) ones for laptop listening, and with these new ones I'm hearing the music in such a better way.The only (slight) issue I have with them is I find myself fidgeting with their placement on my head.  It's not a big or constant deal, and maybe it will go away the more I wear them.  I've owned them for a month now.  It's as if they feel too light, or they move easier than the big ones do since they don't cup around your ear.All in all, I still highly recommend them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1227571200, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2008"}
