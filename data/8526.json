Some headphones have been a little more durable than others. These seem about average in durability so far, and the sound quality is okay though nothing remarkable. If you're an audiophile, obviously you'd want to look at other options. But for the average listener who wants an inexpensive pair of headphones, these are okay.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Okay headphones: decent sound, okay durability, okay for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1360972800, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2013"}
