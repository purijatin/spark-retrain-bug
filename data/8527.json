The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old.  They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound.  I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Little Headphone for Light Use", "unixReviewTime": 1358121600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2013"}
