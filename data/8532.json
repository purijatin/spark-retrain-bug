I wanted something inexpensive, but not junk. I bought this item based on the reviews and it has exceeded my expectations. I forgot my own headphones in my truck today, so I borrowed these from my daughter and I'm blown away and the difference between these and the ones I use with my iPhone (the white buds that come boxed with the iPhone are what I use). The base is much better and the sound overall just sounds much fuller. Not much else for me to say, but I wanted to write a quick review because I'm so impressed with these headphones; for the price, I think it'd be hard to beat. Can't speak much on durability yet, but will update this post if they don't last or break easily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Affordable, quality headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1294617600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2011"}
