I paired this with my Palm Pixi and bluetooth and the sound is amazing!  Yes, the bass is really good and the highs and mids are a bit above average.  Anyone buying these headphones and complaining are not using common sense.  You don't buy headphones/ear buds under $20 and expect Bose performance.  However, this RP-HT21 at $5 is absolutely the best bang for your buck in the world of headphones.  I recommend them over any headphones/ear buds under $20.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best under $20", "unixReviewTime": 1331510400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2012"}
