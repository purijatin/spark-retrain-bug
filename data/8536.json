Great price for the sound quality.  Ten months later, for no discernible reason, the left earpiece went out.OK, I figured, they were only $4.27 - besides, perhaps I did something to cause it (unlikely, because I'm gentle with my electronics).So, I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $4.80 (tax this time, doncha know).  This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you don't mind replacing these every 6-10 months (that's my experience, anyway), these are a great budget pair of headphones: they sound good, and are comfortable.  I'd prefer to pay double, or even triple, the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way?!  It's bad for the environment, and it's inconvenient for me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Great headphones for the price, while they last...", "unixReviewTime": 1322956800, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2011"}
