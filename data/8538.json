I am using them in my Sangean DT-120 radio.  The cord is about 4 feet long so you can put the radio in your pocket and still havde plenty of length remaining.  The headphones are adjustable to fit various head sizes.  I have worn them over a hat.  The main disappointment is the sound level.  The stereo quality is adequate, but I have to turn up the volume on my radio to almost full to get a suitable listening level when outside to compensate for outside noise (traffic etc.). By comparison, my Sony earbuds give the same sound volume at 1/4 of the sound level on my radio.  These headphone have a high impedence level (24 ohms).  Could this be the cause?  I'm not an electronics expert, but I have not seen this high of an impedence on other headphones.To conclude, the headphones were very cheap. Less than $5.00.  For the money they are a good buy.  If you intend to use them for talk radio or listening to sports, they will done fine.  If you intend to listen to music, then I would invest in better quality.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1308268800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2011"}
