These fit snugly around my head and if I'm walking or running or even relaxing at home, I can hear my music and podcasts with good sound quality.  The plug fits iPhones or iPods or any standard entry port.  A great buy!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good solid (and cheap!) Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1377129600, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2013"}
