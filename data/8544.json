The problem isn't so much with the FIT as it is with the static. Yes, I pushed the plug in ALL THE WAY. It CLICKED. There was no silver showing ANYWHERE. And yet there was still static problems everytime the plug was even SLIGHTLY bumped. I know....you get what you pay for...and to be honest, I didn't expect \"Koss Quality\" out of a pair of Panasonic cheapies...but I expected them to be better than they were. As to how to resolve the plug issue, I have no idea...I just know that the design currently used is NOT a good one. If you buy these, I hope you have a better experience than *I* did.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not GREAT...But they will do in a pinch...", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}
