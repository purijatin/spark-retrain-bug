In the mid-90s nearly all portable music devices came with a pair similar to these, and one of the first and best portable CD players, the Panasonic Mash, had a strikingly similar pair.  These were as close as I could come to getting a pair like that, and I was glad I hunted them down when I heard how good the sound was.  There were countless cheap replacement headphones released by companies like Memorex which seem to have left a lasting impression that headphones of this size and shape didn't sound good.  This pair is a good example of how wrong that idea is.  Headphones today seem to only come in earbud or full sized ear enclosing cups, and that's a shame.  Headphones like these were popular during the era when people would jog with a portable cassette player, and I feel the size helps that application.  Larger cups seem heavier and strain my neck after hours of such use.  These have zero sound isolation, but that was part of the design.  Don't get these for a recording studio.  They're great for listening to an mp3, however.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "and one of the first and best portable CD players", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}
