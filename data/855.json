It includes plugs for UK, US, European, and Australian style plugs. Contrary to what one other reviewer says here, it does really support Australian plugs. To use it on an Australian outlet with the angled slots, just twist the blades of the US plug.The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that it's working, but they are fairly bright, so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping, plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update: I replaced the blown fuse with one of these:QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces, 3AG3A250V, F3AL250V, F3A 250V, F3 L250V, F3A 250V, F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm (1/4 in x 1-1/4 in) , 3A 250V, Fast-blow (Fast Acting). Everything appears to be working fine, and I now have 4 spares to take with me on my next trip.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very clever design", "unixReviewTime": 1383868800, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2013"}
