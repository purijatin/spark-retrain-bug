I put them on and listened to Jango on my Toshiba Thrive.  Sounded like I had cotton in my ears.  Bass is good no mids at all but the highs sound like they are being clipped. Like listening to sound through a fan.  I plugged in my older cheapo buds and the sound was 10 times better.  I bought the Panasonic headphones mainly to Skype.  Haven't tried that yet.  Will update.  But hey, what do you want for five bucks.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor hearing...", "unixReviewTime": 1336608000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2012"}
