These do the job.  They sound excellent for 5 dollars, I was quite impressed.  I was expecting static, no bass, horrible treble, but they really are great for the price.  I went by all the other reviews and they were right.  They are smaller than I thought around the ears, but incredibly comfortable.  These headphones compare to headphones in the 30 dollar price range easily and beat them.  For less than 5 dollars, you just can't go wrong with these.  They sound tons better than iPod headphones and those cheap ones.  I really can't say enough good things so obviously you already know they are good headphones and easily worth 40 dollars.  I highly recommend them for 5 dollars with free shipping you can't go wrong, if you always break or lose headsets.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1284422400, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2010"}
