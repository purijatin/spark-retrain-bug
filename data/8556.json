Well, I was wrong and the RP-HT21's have me sold. While the bass on these headphones is not powerful, as expected, shockingly everything else about the sound quality (to my untrained ears) is more than satisfactory. I remain using my expensive headphones for high quality sound largely for psychological reasons.They have not broken or otherwise failed since I bought them 8 months prior to writing this review. I can hear audio from 40 Hz to 14500 Hz on a frequency spectrum video (http://youtu.be/qNf9nzvnd1k) with no quiet or dead zones. (I can hear from 25 Hz to 17000 Hz from my more expensive ATH-M50's and I am convinced that is my natural hearing range)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very impressive for $5", "unixReviewTime": 1388880000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2014"}
