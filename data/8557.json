I run through a lot of  these headphones and found that I run through them just as fast whether they cost much or not, so have decided to just stock on the cheaper ones. I bought some Sony ones at the same time I got these that were around same price and I think the sound is better on these. My husband advised me to stock up on these since they would probably quit making them as soon as everyone got hooked on them. Sound advice, indeed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Just great!", "unixReviewTime": 1271376000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2010"}
