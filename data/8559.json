If that is what you want, take a look at the price tag and then add them to your cart.I purchased two pair of these phones for my children (5 and 2) knowing full-well that they will be broken, taped, glued, and abused some more.  With the quality and comfort of them and at about $5 per unit, I don't mind if I buy twenty over the next few years.For myself, I purchased RP-HT46-S.  This unit is essentially identical except it folds up and includes an in-line volume adjustment for more than double the price.  Should I need to replace it though, I will do so with RP-HT21.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Received exactly what I wanted", "unixReviewTime": 1264982400, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2010"}
