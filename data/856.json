I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Clunky and broken.", "unixReviewTime": 1327190400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2012"}
