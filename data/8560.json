I've read where a couple of reviewers have called them \"Good for the price\", but in fact, they're a great deal better than a number of different brands of headphones that are considerably higher priced.PROS: These headphones, while certainly not symphony quality, are more than adequate for an evening's work or play on my computer, or with my phone and mp3 players. They're lightweight, they're comfortable in the extreme, and I'm impressed with both their higher and bass ranges, sound-wise. Though they're probably considered \"open air\" phones, they do quite a good job of blocking out outside sounds, since they cover most of the ear. Unless it's awfully hot out, they also breathe pretty well, and so don't overheat my ears, even if I've been wearing them for a couple of hours.CONS: The only real \"con\" I can find with these headphones is that they don't survive ME very well! As I said, this is the second pair of RP-HT21's I've owned, and it's the second pair I've broken an earphone off of! The first pair took it in the neck, so to speak, when I accidentally stepped on them (barefooted, and it wasn't a full-weight crunch, either); the second pair got sat on while on the bed. My fault in both cases, and a bit of tape will hold them together this time. Still, though they still \"wear\" fine, every time I pull them off now, I have to put them back together.Despite this con, these Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones are worth way more than their price; indeed, they'd be more than worth it at TWICE their price. I will definitely be getting another set of them.In fact, I think I'll buy a FEW pairs this time!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love These Earphones--But Wish They Survived ME Better!", "unixReviewTime": 1308787200, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2011"}
