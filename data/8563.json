They like the fit and feel of the headsets on their smaller heads vs. the plug style headphones.  One of the two has broken already after about 90 days.  The issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which, when pulled out from the netbook or DVD player, it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connection.I ordered a replacement because the kids like them.  The kids like them and the price is right.  I have tried to get them to be more careful with the plugs, but I don't think it is their hands pulling on them as much as the design.  They are adequate and serve a good purpose for us.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Adequate Headphones, Get What You Pay For", "unixReviewTime": 1314057600, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2011"}
