The cord length is a bit longer than usual, which is nice.  They could be slightly more comfortable, but they are by no means uncomfortable.  I think the main thing about the fit/comfort is they are a little tight, and the ear pieces are a little narrower front to back than the Panasonic headphones I used for years.  I'm certain they will losen up with use.  They pivot in two directions, so they should fit just about anybody.  You really can't beat these for the price.  I'll probably buy one or two more pairs as spares.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Good For The Money", "unixReviewTime": 1277078400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2010"}
