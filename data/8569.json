These headphones have great sound no matter what I'm listening to, and they're durable.  I stuff them into drawers, bags, under pillows, and they keep working.  One pair usually lasts me from twelve to eighteen months.  Really worth the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones at a good price", "unixReviewTime": 1314057600, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2011"}
