I use it every morning to heat water with a immersion heater I insert in my coffee mug to make coffee each day. At other times I use it to charge my kindle, backup batteries, camera and cellphone.I wish I had purchased 2 so I can use more than one outlet at a time. I did bring along an extension cord, but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate. Using 2 outlets is more efficient. I'm buying an additional one for my next trip.Highly recommend this one, as it is very versatile with the USB port.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exceeded my expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1370390400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2013"}
