My wife has used a set of these for a couple of years and likes them because they are lightweight and feel comfortable to her. She recently broke the headband, which I was able to repair, so I bought another pair as a backup.I used a different set of these same phones myself for several months some time ago. I listen to audio on my iPod while I walk laps on an indoor track, and I found the sound to be very pleasing to me. However, it turned out that the foam cushions on the headphones were slightly rough. These pads irritated the skin on my ears just enough after long, heavy, usage that I gave them away and replaced them with EarPods.I would recommend these headphones to a friend whose ears don't stick out as far as mine do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "These phones are a good value", "unixReviewTime": 1399852800, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2014"}
