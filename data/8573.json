The sound quality is excellent, and it is probably louder than the badly fitting earbuds that came with my MP3 player.The headband when set in its lowest position is still a bit high for my head, as I keep my hair short. Anyone with more depth of hair will have plenty of adjustment. It's not enough to put me off them.I recommend them as great value.  I'm ordering more of them to keep around for when I break them or lose them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound, comfort and value", "unixReviewTime": 1365638400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2013"}
