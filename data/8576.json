Don't get me wrong - they are OK for music but not great and would never be my first choice for Beethoven's 7th Symphony - but considering their price, they're not bad.The voice quality for audiobooks is crisp and clean and you can still hear what's going on around you (very little isolation).  They are also comfortable and I have worn them for over two hours at a time.Did I mention that they are cheap.  I have a pair in the bedroom, one in a travel bag, and a spare for when one of my cats decides to chew on another pair's wires!You will not be disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect for Audiobooks", "unixReviewTime": 1353369600, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2012"}
