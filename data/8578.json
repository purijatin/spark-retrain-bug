Considering how cheap the price is, I ordered him 2 pairs.  That was over a year ago.  He is still using the first pair!  The other pair has yet to be opened.He hates ear buds.  He had a pair of these headphones in the past & loved them.  He wore them until they fell apart.  I am sure that is what will happen with this next pair.He is not a light headphone user.  He will wear these for many many hours every day while working at his job & at home.  He uses them with his ipods (the touch & the older large sized one) as well as using them when he borrows one of my ipods (a tiny ipod shuffle).  These headphones work with all of these devices.  Oh, & I almost forgot to mention that he uses these on the computer sometimes too.For the price these simply cannot be beat!  If you are an ear bud hater like my hubby then these are the way to go!  And heck why not get 2 pairs while your at it?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My Husband Loves These!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2011"}
