In-ear phones were very uncomfortable. And hang-in-ear types like Apple earbuds always fell out (besides having mediocre sound). After reading the reviews here I ordered three pairs. I just finished giving a thorough listening test using a couple iPods and a variety of classical, jazz, big band, and pop music. Just amazing. Big, punchy, crisp, clear, great definition. I'm simply amazed. The headband adjusts for length and there is enough &#34;play&#34; in the band ends that the earpads could adequately tilt, front-to-back, to rest flush with my ears.For critical mixing and recording evaluation I'll continue to use my studio headphones but when exercising, traveling, outside, or just around the house, these are fantastic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply amazing sound and value", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}
