I have to take it off before plugging this headphone in because I guess the jack is too big and the pixel skin only allows for thin jacks which is annoying I guess. I have plenty of other headphones/earbuds and only this pair of headphones seemed to have this issue. In terms of sound, don't get your hopes up in blocking environment noise but the sound quality itself is good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Jack doesn't fit with certain iPhone cases.", "unixReviewTime": 1328227200, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2012"}
