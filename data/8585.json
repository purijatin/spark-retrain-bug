The sound was fine, but I could not get comfortable when I wore them.  Maybe the plastic was deformed?  I don't know.  Maybe I just have a wierd head!  Ha. They would twist on my head and would not lay flat on my ears.  Anyway, I just flat out threw them out.  Couldn't wear them.  Sorry for bad review......but it's the truth!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Maybe I got a bad pair?  Extremely uncomfortable!", "unixReviewTime": 1388102400, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013"}
