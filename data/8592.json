What's the point of buying more expensive ones when they don't last much longer than the cheaper models? For the price I wasn't expecting much but I found them to be pretty comfortable and the volume is pretty good as well. Unlike the Koss headphones the Panasonic ones allow you to turn up the volume quite a bit and the overall sound quality was decent as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Basic headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1308268800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2011"}
