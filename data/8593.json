Frequency response of 16HZ to22KHZ, I believe it (We can only hear 20HZ to 20KHZ).Crisp, no crackle highs, and no distorted lows.With plenty of POWER! I use these for about 6 hours a day, 7 days a week. they are so comfortable that after the first day of use, i forget they are on, and nearly yank my laptop off of the table! Don't let the first fit fool you when you first put them on. They start out snug, but soon you can't feel them. GREAT SOUND low or high volume, and with all styles of music. From Classical, to Hip Hop, to the guitar gods of the classic rock era. (Rest in piece Ronnie Montrose), who passed on last week. I listened to Town Without Pity, and Rock Candy for hours with these. I think the next set will last much longer, because i do a \"headphone check\" before I get up from my computer. This is another marriage saving feature. You can hear your wife talk to you, and answer her intelligently, not like buds. I just ordered 2 more of them, for UNDER $10.00 delivered (2 day shipping for free. I love Amazon Prime)!BUY THESE, AND GET AMAZON PRIME!!! The headphones lasted 6months , until my cat ate the wires. (Oh well, live & learn)...This quality item for under $5.00 each can't be beat...Amazon Prime paid for itself in about 4 months of 2 day shipping.Not to mention that the Prime free video service(Free movie & tv shows streaming when you want them, similar to netflix)!From music to movies, yummy!Liquid Tusk.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best light headphone EVER!", "unixReviewTime": 1331424000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2012"}
