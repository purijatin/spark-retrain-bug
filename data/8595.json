Earbuds hurt my ears, so I wanted a &#34;headband&#34; style pair that sat on the outside of my ears. I chose the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port because of the price (&#60;$5) and because there were so many great reviews. Normally, I shy away from super cheap deals because you usually get what you pay for (i.e., cheap deal = cheap product). Not so with these headphones. They are lightweight with a very decent sound, and are extremely comfortable. I had no problems wearing these on a 4 hour flight. My ears never hurt once, and I hardly noticed the headband. Plus, if I do every lose or break them, I won't be upset because of the price. But they seem very durable, and survived a round trip flight and being shoved in my backpack. They've already been used well more than $5 worth, so I feel like it's money well spent. If you need a great set of headphones at a reasonable price, then definitely get these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Comfortable Headphones, Fantastic Price", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}
