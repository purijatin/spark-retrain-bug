Very durable and works as advertised.It was advertised as fitting 22\"-37\" televisions, but the size of the t.v mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television. I will have to cut the metal plate to get to the P.C connector if i choose to connect a computer.Haven't decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate.Other than that, it's a great product and meets my need for a hanging television.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Durable", "unixReviewTime": 1295654400, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2011"}
