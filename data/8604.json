(wish I could have told you which model but it has worn of)After listening to these on my laptop for a couple of hours I have to say that out of the box, the mid to high frequencies are boosted way too much for my liking (vocals and percussion stand out and overpower the bass). I have used the equalizer in winamp to reduce the harshness of the frequencies a bit and it sounds better.That being said audio source has a big part to play, so i can't say how these will sound on a portable audio device with limited equalizer abilities.Other things to note are that its kinda small(30mm driver), its very light, and cables are kinda thin.Bottom line for 5 bucks....you would be hard pressed to find betterbut if you need better i would advise anything with at least 40mm drivers that cost at least 15 dollars with a single-sided cord.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Price.....Above Average Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1336694400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2012"}
