It's clearly not a 4-star headphone, but for the price, it's definitely worth it.Amazingly, this $5 headphone has better bass than a $40 pair of headphones I got last year sometime.  It's the best bass you'll find in a headphone this cheap, guaranteed.  I defy you to find better!The actual sound quality is 'ok'.  It's very low power.  If you're accustomed to listening to your music on volume 12, let's say, you'll need it on volume 14 or 15 with these headphones.  However, when you do, it gives a nice rich bass sound, a below average mid-range and a below average treble.Like I said, for $5.20 and free shipping (thanks to Amazon Prime) this was a no-brainer, and maybe the best $5 I ever spent on headphones.  This is a spare set, for when I forget my other ones (I have 3 headphones).  I lose headphones and sit on them or break them so often, it's nice to have this one around.But in realistic terms, if you're rating this in terms of sound, regardless of price, I'd give these headphones a 2.5 out of 5.Update: 9/15/10 - After only 2 short months of use, my left speaker rattles, rendering the headphones virtually useless.  I actually only used the headphones maybe 5 or 6 times before they blew.  That's $1 per use!
