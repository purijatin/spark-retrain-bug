They just blow the white, ipod headphones out of the water- no comparison at all. The only con for me is that the sounds from the headphones leak out into the air, meaning these will probably be good in busy settings, but not so good in a library or office setting.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "can't believe they're so cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1274832000, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2010"}
