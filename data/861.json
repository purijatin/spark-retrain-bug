Can't understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months. It should last a lot longer than that. Won't keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station. Switched back to the OEM cable, and what do you know? It's charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 10/1/2013: Nope, the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone, as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaply-made $9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus' OEM charger, it worked just fine. I do believe I'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Worked for awhile...can't understand how it went bad", "unixReviewTime": 1379116800, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2013"}
