The highs are not much better than the ipod earbuds and bass is about the same. They fit comfortably, and i can wear glasses when using them which is a plus (no ear pinching). The price is the only reason to buy these, and I only use them so I don't have to stuff nicer headphones in my backpack or risk breaking nice headphones when biking or snowboarding. They aren't very sensitive (you gotta turn the volume up a lot to get them loud) but they have been durable for some time now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Only ok", "unixReviewTime": 1266710400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2010"}
