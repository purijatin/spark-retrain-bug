I was only a few cents short and I didn't want to have to spend another $3 to $5 in shipping, so I began to look around for little things that I would have considered nice to have just so that I could get another item for that money.  I was very lucky to stumble upon these headphones as they have quickly become my favorite item from that group purchase.  What I thought would have been just a nice, keep to the side just in case item, have become my favorite headset to use on the computer and I use them everyday.These Panasonics were incredibly cheap when I purchased them (around that $3-5 range) but the quality and sound they have are incredible for that price point.  I have not had a problem with discerning any kind of sound from videos, games, sound effects, etc. They are also very comfortable as the ear portions can slide very far to fit a variety of different head sizes.  The cord is also a good length so that you have a decent amount of room to work with in leaning down from the computer jack or using with an iPod.I have had no complaints using these headphones and, to be honest, am very surprised at just how good they are.  You can't go wrong with these headphones and especially at the price, consider them a great bargain instead of cheap knock offs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple Headphones With Great Sound and Price", "unixReviewTime": 1355356800, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2012"}
