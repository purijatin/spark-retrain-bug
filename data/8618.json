Sherwin", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "It's pretty unbelievable at first, but these inexpensive headphones really give you quite a bit of use for your money! They connect easily to MP3 players and similar devices; and the bass is awesome just as everyone says it is. Moreover, at this price you simply can't go wrong.If you listen to a CD or MP3 player daily, I would recommend buying a few sets of these. They do go south eventually and you won't have to worry about waiting for another pair to ship.These are also much, much better than earbud headphones; the earbuds always make my ears hurt! The over the head strap is fairly comfortable and that alone makes this a much better choice than the earbud type of headphones.In addition, use these for young kids who may not be all that gentle with them. That way if they break or get lost you won't be out too much money.I highly recommend these headphones; they may not be the very best out there (after all, they're not Sennheiser, Skull Candy hesh headphones or Skullcrushers) but the sound quality is really quite good and you can't beat the price. You won't be too upset if these break or get lost, either.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "they do a good job for a rock bottom price", "unixReviewTime": 1255564800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2009"}
