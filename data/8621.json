Burdette", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "These are great headphones for daily use for computers, mp3 players, to take in the car for portable DVD players, etc.  We have probably 7-8 pair floating around the house for the kids to use as they please - kids who are currently 13 years old down to 2.  I've replaced all the other cheap headphones that came with mp3 players, etc.  We have never had a pair of these stop working after three years.The one complaint for us is that the cord contains two wires all the way from the plug up to the headset.  The two separate wires are joined together, but our 6 year old enjoyed splitting those two apart.  So we ended up with what seems like a lot of wires all flopping around, getting tangled, etc.  She did that to three pair over the course of several weeks before I realized what she was doing and put a stop to it.  But, even so, none of those pair have stopped working.  Just a bit of a pain to deal with.  But, as I said, this is more about our child than the headphones themselves.  But, if the cord were a single, it couldn't be split.Also, these aren't officially \"kid's headphones\" so they don't adjust down small enough to fit securely on tiny heads. But for less than $5 a pair, I've not minded bending the metal to help them fit better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value, great for daily use for kids", "unixReviewTime": 1305849600, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2011"}
