The 3.5mm stereo headphones has a R and a L on each speaker, so one doesn't put them on backwards, I guess.  The speakers swivel to accommodate your ears, just like in the more expensive headphones.  The length of the cord is about one yard which is the right size for your MP3 player or computer.  It has been over a month now, and it still works great.  I am sure it will last for many years, knock on wood.  I recommend this Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port, it really is lightweight.  The sound quality is awesome, just remember to brush your hair back, so the headphones go on without obstacles, I found that this item works best when my hair doesn't obstruct the headphones from the ears.  I highly recommend these headphones, just put them on and you're set to go.  I rate this a 5 star.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2014"}
