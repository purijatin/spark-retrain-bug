They feel decent to the head and ears, work fine. I own 3 or 4 pairs and has had no trouble with any of them. The round listening parts readily come off and go back on, meaning that if the cords are hopelessly tangled (my kids do that all the time), you can take the listening part off and make the untangling much easier to do.I don't know what they mean by \"XBS Port\" here. These headphones fit in regular headphone slots, like those in computers, radios, iPads, etc.I am ordering another one of these because my kids are always misplacing headphones and fighting for them. These are so inexpensive that I can afford to keep ordering until my kids have two or three each and can stop their fighting!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "all around great", "unixReviewTime": 1358467200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2013"}
