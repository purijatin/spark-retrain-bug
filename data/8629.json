I also know that they become uncomfortable after wearing them for a while.  The RP-H21 are pretty nice for the money I spent.  Great sound - I forgot how nice they can be.  I'm listening to the Holiday CD by Hans Zimmer now using the earphones - awesome.  I am getting older, and have to admit that my hearing isn't what it used to be.  The earphones bring quality to sound that I have not had for quite a while.  Very clear, good right left sound separation (when the source has that), and great low sound range that I really didn't expect.  Yea, they are a little uncomfortable after you wear them for a while, but the beautiful sound outweighs that aspect.  Compared to the older earphones I used to have, the RP-H21s are much lighter and much more comfortable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "nice 4 the price", "unixReviewTime": 1273622400, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2010"}
