But the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough.Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.The cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my PC but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable. Ergo the downgrade in my rating from 4 to 2 stars.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not so good cable, 40\" long - update", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013"}
