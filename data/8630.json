Fitment is great, they're comfortable, they sound good, they're inexpensive, they have a long cord, and an adjustable headband.  What more could you want?  I plugged these into a set of portable headset mounted DVD players during a road trip with my kids and they were flawless the entire time (45 hours of driving).  Perfect for their purpose.  DVD players - check.  Headphones - check.  Sanity - check!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1344384000, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2012"}
