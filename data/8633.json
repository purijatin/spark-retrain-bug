I would go through about 2 of these a year due to the fact that they break too easily, even if you drop it on the carpet.  Plus, if you accidentally snag the wire while wearing it, you're more than likely going to break the part where you adjust them to fit over your head.I have to admit, even though the wire is pretty short (an audio extender did the trick), the bass is incredible.  They're not exactly like the noise cancelling type, but it's very comfortable while wearing them (I use it mainly for my iPod and PC).I have tried other headphones in the past, but since I tend to wear them for several hours a day, they start to hurt my ears after a while.  I've never had a problem with these.I highly recommend this if you're on a limited budget and looking for an inexpensive set of headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Purchased several of these over the years...", "unixReviewTime": 1387929600, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2013"}
