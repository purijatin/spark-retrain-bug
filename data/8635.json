They're very light and produce clear sounds. However as you can probably guess from the size, they won't go as high a volume without distortion or give you much bass. I bought these because during summer wearing my over-the-ear headphones can get a little stuffy on the computer and I wanted light headphones that feel like I'm not wearing them.So far these feel great and light enough that I almost feel like I'm not wearing any headphones. Also, they have not caused any discomfort to my ears after 5 hours of constant use. They stay on the ears very well and will not fall off even when I shake my head hard.I give 4/5 for comfort. I feel the cushion on these headphones should be a little thicker on the edges because the plastic edges can be felt on the ears and is not as comfortable as I'd like it.Also the sound gets 4/5 because it's easily distorted with high volume, volume doesn't go high enough in some applications, and although the bass is present, it's weak.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great buy for the price, don't expect anything amazing.", "unixReviewTime": 1315267200, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2011"}
