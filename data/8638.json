I purchased these to listen to my CD's and movies via my laptop and I am enjoying it.  The sound is very nice the bass has a nice rich tone.  I treasure my headphones and because I don't want to share (not really) but I purchased a less expensive set for my grandchildren to listen to their Leap Frogs games and movies.  It does make a difference with them having their own headphones.  What a difference it makes (I didn't pay an arm or a leg for these, but the quality of sound is really nice).  I would recommend this set to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money for headphones.  The price was right and I am so glad I purchase this set.  As I am writing I am listening to my 101 Strings CD via of my laptop using my headphones.  Beautiful!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "...Just Love My Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1334534400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2012"}
