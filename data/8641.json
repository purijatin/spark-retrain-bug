Those ended up snapping in two, so it became a must to get new headphones.First off, the bass on these headphones is good. I was also surprised at how good the sound quality is on these phones.I've seen some complaints here that these headphones are too small. I've kinda got a big head, so this concerned me. It does feel a bit snug and the speakers are a bit small for my ears, but that really doesn't bug me much. In fact, the snugness lets me hear it better.The cord is also longer than the Maxell, and the band doesn't feel like cheap plastic.Overall, these headphones rock!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1343779200, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2012"}
