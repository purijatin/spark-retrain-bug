Let me explain.I have had many headphones for years, from high-end Grados to mid- and low-end Sennheisers. Full- or compact-size and earbuds, you name it, I have owned them all.This Panasonic RP-HT21 has a similar sound signature to Panasonic RP-HTX-7, a very fashionable pair that cost 6 times more. The sound stage is quite good and its bass response mimic what I hear from my Grados. The mid-range is as smooth, if not smoother, than Sennheiser's PX90/100/200. The one point deduction comes from the high-pitch sound, where it just broke apart. Other than that, it is hard to believe that a five-buck headphone can sound this decent.If radio/TV use is your primary reason when selecting headphones, look no further.If you want a casual music listen experience, this will be a serious content. IMHO, this has all Sennheisers (excluding earbuds) PX and HD series headphones beat (below 60-dollar range).As long as its build quality (all cheap plastic mind you) holds up, this gotta be the king of all budget headphones when cost and sound quality are put into equation.One minor note though, the all plastic headband snatches my hair when adjusting. I rarely get this kind of treatment from other cans.In the end, you cannot lose buying this little guy and you could be pleasantly surprised as I have been.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wonderful surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1323216000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2011"}
