Trust me, your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucks.I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics hurt after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.Of course, your head may be different than mine, but I think most users will find the Koss phones more comfortable.Good luck!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Okay for the money, but spend a little more and get Koss KTXPRO1", "unixReviewTime": 1377820800, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2013"}
