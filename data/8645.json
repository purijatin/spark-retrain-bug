For the last 6 years, I was using Sony MDR710, excellent portable headphones. I ordered Sennheiser PX200 II recently but found it greatly lacked the bass! Returned it and ordered these seeing the great reviews. It's just a few notches down as compared to Sony MDR710/Sennheiser PX 200II. But has good bass as compared to PX 200, which cost ten times more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent! Good lows, mids and bass", "unixReviewTime": 1392163200, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2014"}
