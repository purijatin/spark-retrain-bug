They are NOT as good as the Sennheiser 100's they are replacing, but for a cost that is 10% of those, these are just fine for the gym. They are perfectly acceptable for working out, but a few things I noticed are as folows:1. Not as loud as Senneheiser - these just barely get loud enough on quiet songs for my iPod Nano2. Not as comfortable - these are not uncomfortable (everyones head is different - right?), but feel a little harder on the ears and the head band is scratchy when you put around your neck.3. These are brighter (less warmth and bass response) , but sound is pretty accurate overall and tweaking the EQ helps some.Overall, these are a great deal for active people who need a cheap set of headphones. I would not give it 4 stars if it was more expensive, but value is part of the equation here. I still have my nice headphones for use at home, but I spent less than $5 on these, so very happy overall!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good sound - Great price!", "unixReviewTime": 1360800000, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2013"}
