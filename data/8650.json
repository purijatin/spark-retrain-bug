I just wanted a spare set of headphones to use with my LAPTOP and as another light weight audio option. When I saw the price and the reviews here I had to try them. I am a headphone guy buying Skullcandy, Sony, and two different Panasonics just in the last 3 weeks! I must say that these Panasonic RT-HT21 are really excellent for this price and even at three times the price would be an excellent choice! They are very well built and I think you would really have to abuse them to break them! The base is nice (FULL), mid and highs are very clear as well. Just a perfectly nice balanced sounding pair of headphones is the best way to describe them. I am certain they  would fit even the largest size head when fully extended with no problem easy. This is really a great way to go for a very well made set of headphones especially if you want just the best value for your money. Great job Panasonic and thanks for a really nice product that is truly worth every penny!!!!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Panasonic RP-HT21 great VALUE !!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1327276800, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2012"}
