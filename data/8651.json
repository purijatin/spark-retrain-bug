The first time I plugged it in to my iPhone the sound started strong then slowly faded. I discovered that the plug was not making a good connection to the phone.  After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I got it to consistently work adequately. I was impressed by the fullness of the sound and the bass response. I also like the over the head model of earphones as they don't fall off like the in ear styles do.  For the price, even if they only last a couple months I feel I've gotten my money's worth. I'd reccomend them for someone who isn't an \"audiophile\" and just needs a basic set of over the head earphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works OK, good sound", "unixReviewTime": 1295568000, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2011"}
