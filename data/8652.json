Stevens", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Wow, I was looking for a &#34;normal&#34; pair of headphones which is actually very hard. I didn't want earbuds as they hurt my ears, I didn't want a microphone, I didn't need noise canceling etc. etc. etc... I just wanted something that I could use with my laptop when I'm listening to music and watching a movie. Long story short these are AMAZING! I have a headset that I use for gaming and believe it or not I think the sound quality is better on these &#34;cheap&#34; headphones!Pros:-Comfortable! I can't tell you how much earbuds and other headphones hurt my ears. These are actually comfortable!-Sound quality. OMG! I am listening to music right now with these and I feel like I'm right there at the concert.-Lightweight. They are so light it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my head.-Price. You can't get this great quality for this low of a price from anywhere else.Cons:-NONE. I don't have any cons personally and have thoroughly enjoyed this product so far.I give it 5 out of 5 stars because it's an amazing product that was super cheap and does everything that I want.I recommend these headphones to anyone who's fed up of buying expensive headphones but want good quality. I also recommend this to anyone that has had any neck problems from previous headphones as these are super light and you will forget that they are on your head in you aren't listening to anything. THESE ARE THE HEADPHONES YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow.... better sound quality than my $100 headset!", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}
