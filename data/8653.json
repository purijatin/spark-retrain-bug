Ireland \"Reformed Luddite\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Based on reviews of the great sound quality, I foolishly ordered two pair.  Such a low price, why not?  THIS is why not -- if all you want to hear is bass, these might be ok.  But they have very little range.  The sound was tinny and I regret the purchase.  Unfortunately shipping to return them will cost almost as much as the items, so in the junk drawer they go in case all my other headphones should break.  Lesson learned once again -- you really do get what you pay for!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good if ALL you want to hear is bass", "unixReviewTime": 1317600000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2011"}
