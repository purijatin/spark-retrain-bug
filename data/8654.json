These headphones are awesome!First, I am not a big Panasonic fan, and I normally don't buy this companies products.I found these in my friends closet, and I need a pair so I tried these, I thought they would be junk, THEY ARE AWESOME!The bass is very good, and the sound is clear. Normally with lots of bass, the sound is crap. This is an even level of both. Also, they fit very well on your head, not tight, just snug, seems to even drown some exterior sound out. =DI go to BigLots mostly for my headphones, and I spend $10-$15 for headphones that are crap. This is a good deal, on Amazon.I am buying some now, I can't wait to get them! Very happy with my find.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What A Pleasant Surprise!", "unixReviewTime": 1344988800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2012"}
