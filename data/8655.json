Yatabe \"ymiked59\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewtext": "I did extensive research for the best value over-the-ear headphones to replace some in-ear earbuds (the kind that get all gunky and funky with regular use) and eventually, after reading roughly 32,452 different reviews on Amazon, I determined that these were the ones I'd try.I was not disappointed.If you're hoping for decent sound quality and solid frequency range, then these will work for you.If you're wanting to stand out from the other mass transit commuters or impress classmates with your ultra stylish chrome accented DJ cans designed by Dr. Dre, then I'd still recommend that you get some of these and save towards the purchase of the others.Two things - I've got a larger sized cranium and the plastic 'strap' on these isn't all that accomodating.  If I adjust the fit while I'm wearing these headphones, I'll sometimes lose a few hairs out of the sides of my head.  So if you've got a big head or big hair, you probably want to look elsewhere for your aural excitement.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best $5 headphones I've ever owned", "unixReviewTime": 1282521600, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2010"}
