I am not a fan of most of today's sound. It lacks the depth and bottom end which makes the music for me. these headphones have an interesting range of sound including bottom end. I bought two pairs and plan on buying more. they are like the phones we used to get w/ portable cassette players - not all that sturdy but they are affordable and sound great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent!", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}
