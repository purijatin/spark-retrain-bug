I bought both to have a backup in case one stops working. In the last few years I've bought at least 6 which have all stopped working.The Panasonic RP-HT21 and the Sony MDR-110LP are very similar. Both work well and both are about the same price. Also both can be easily adjusted for different head sizes ranging from a small child to an adult. Just gently pull the band on each side and it will expand.For me both of these headsets work well. However, the sound on the Panasonic may be a bit better. It seems to be a bit clearer like my old headset which cost several dollars more. My old headset stopped working on one side after only a few months of use. Hopefully these will last longer.For my purposes the Panasonic is perfect. I use it at my desktop daily to listen to mp3s, movies, youtube videos and all sounds on my computer (including an occasional popup advertisement). So far this seems to be the best headset you can find in this price range. However, if you're a music fanatic and must have more sound control perhaps you'll need to spend more on an expensive headset. Most people, however, should find the RP-HT21 to be perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "perfect for me", "unixReviewTime": 1328486400, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2012"}
