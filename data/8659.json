Anyway, I listen to music almost all day long (desk job), so i go through headphones quickly. they wear out, get broken, what have you. So i've been through several pairs in the last few years. I picked up a pair of these a few days ago and was absolutely blown away by the sound. None of the cheapies I've bought lately even come close. Buy these, you won't be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the money, these are the best headphones you're going to find.", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"}
