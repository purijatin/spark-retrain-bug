The sound is a nice step up from the stock Apple Earbuds, which sounded muddy and distorted no matter the source or EQ settings.  They were also a pain to keep in my ears.  These are light and comfortable, even moreso with the ear pads taken off which lowers the temps they will reach while on your head plus the sound seems a touch clearer.  I taped off the XBS ports and it seems to give a fuller bass sound with a smoother roll off (kinda reminds me of the sound of bass from a sealed box vs. a ported box).  These aren't audiophile phones but most likely the best you're going to do for under $10 and is a lot better than what they ship with most portable audio devices.  A final note, I see many people saying the Bass is strong.  I disagree but then again I love strong bass.  I'd explain these 'phones as being a fuller bass and treble setup with both somewhat drowning out mids.  However, these respond better to EQ'ing than the Apple 'buds, so some customization is possible.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great budget replacements for stock headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1336867200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2012"}
