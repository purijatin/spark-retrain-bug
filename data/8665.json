Very Surprised as These Don't look or sound Cheap Like Dollar Store headphones.  These made a Huge Difference and Increased the Volume Output from the Cheap DVD Headphones.  I compared these to my $35 German Made AKG Portable headphones and although these Don't Have the same quality Bass they sound Very Crisp and Clear.  I Use these when I don't want to Risk Losing My expensive Pair I Paid almost 10x more for.  Very soft, Comfortable on the ears and I Read they are discontinued by Panasonic so I would Buy them quickly. Excellent Pair of Headphones for well under $10.00.  I've Learned My Portable device is Only as Good as Your Headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1203379200, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2008"}
