The sound is pretty good for a $5 headphone. It's no beats by Dre, but the Bass is decent, and the mid and high levels sound well balanced. They are very light and confortable, and sound better than the in-ear headphones that came with my Iphone. I haven't seen or heard of anything better for $5. I think you would have to buy in the $20-30+ range to beat these. Again just some good cheap headpones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Cheap Headphone", "unixReviewTime": 1322438400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2011"}
