I've noticed no loss of sound quality.The very first time I put these on and watched a demo video, I was shocked at the \"surround sound feel\", so much so, I looked around, thinking someone else was playing a video. The sound is VERY clear, you can hear all instrumentation in the background. On my old cheapy headphones, I had to have the volume at least 10-12 bars high to hear, with these, 3-4 bars will do perfectly. This shows the large range of volume these have.I was pleasantly surprised that the ear \"piece\" actually swivels in and out for a better fit to your head. It took a week to get used to the large, flat cushioned ear piece (it kind of smashed my ear), but I barely notice now.CON:I thought the wide head band would fit better on my head, but for some reason, even sitting still at a desk, these still slide backwards on the smallest setting. The surface is extremely smooth, no grip, which is probably the reason. It's the only annoyance I have with these.JOGGING/EXERCISING:I had some slippage as well while jogging, but again, will have to play with the adjustments. Note: The ear cushions are large and if you sweat a bit, this will make it a bit uncomfortable as they will get wet. (However, it's better then ear buds constantly falling out of your ears)All in all, these are PERFECT for the price of a basic user. I'm VERY happy with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasantly suprised!!", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}
