I chose the over the ear type instead of buds because we were losing buds at the rate of 2 or 3 a week (seriously) between our house and our mini-van A/V setup. I figured over the ear headphones would be harder to lose for the kids and easier for me to find since 1) they were bigger and 2) the kids did not want to be seen outside the house with these :-). Also, losing headphones at this price point versus $20 ear buds is a little more tolerable.Simply stated, for the price point, they cannot be beat.  Build quality was not bad at all and I would classify them as durable.  In fact, on the two sets I purchased, I found it to be better than expected. In terms of design, I think the best word to describe it could be: utilitarian.  The headphones are very light weight. We found the cord more than long enough to plug into the headphone port of our monitors or laptops.  BUT, if you need to run the cord a long length, like to the back to a CPU under the desk, you will need a simple extension such asStereo Headphone Extension 12 feet 3.5mm.  The over the ear padding was more than sufficient for its purpose in my opinion. However, other reviewers have remarked otherwise. The headphones are adjustable enough that they fit a wide range of heads in my house from mine, to both my 6 and 12 year old.Sound quality is OK.  That's about it. However, that was all I was looking for.  For serious sound, my children and I rely on better quality ear buds anywhere from the $8 to $35 range.For the right purpose, you will not be disappointed in these headphones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent for Low Cost Alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1383436800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2013"}
