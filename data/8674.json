I am amazed by thebass tones that come through on lots of music.  I listen to a variety of pop/rock/indie/metal/really heavy metalwith lots of bass/folk,  quite a bit of variety.  These headphones (for the PRICE) give sound quality MUCHbetter than your average $20 to $25 headphone.  I cannot speak for how long these will work.  The wiresare a bit flimsy,  but perhaps that's so they can flex better.  At any rate,  I'm going to orderabout 5 more pair just to have some around.Why order a single pair of $100 headphones?  I'd rather have a bunch of these for my money!Excellent product for the money.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Been using them for about a week", "unixReviewTime": 1271894400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2010"}
