I did not want an expensive set of head phones, (they might \"walk away\"), so this was a good buy. I figured I could go through 10 sets at $5 a set, and it would be worth it, even if each set didn't hold up very long - compared to having a $50 set for 1 week, then they disappear into thin air.I've used the earbuds for awhile, (about 4 yrs) and they're OK, about $8 a set in the grocery store, sound quality decent, but they wear out after a few months (not surprising).  My only real complaint with the earbuds was every time I fixed them comfortably in my ears, someone would come up to me for something, and I'd have to take them out and then spend 5 minutes trying to get them comfortable again!So I looked around for headphones, thinking at least I could just pop them on and off.VERY SURPRISED!!!!!!! and pleased at how 1) comfortable; 2) excellent fit (usually after 3 months the headpiece has stretched out on every pair, cheap or expensive, I have ever owned, and they're too loose;  3) truly great sound quality and 4) durable.  I'm hard on everything.  They're still working fine.Both speakers are working perfectly. True stereo.I have very good hearing - I can hear someone using a stapler 3 work areas away with no trouble - that's why I need the headphones.The sound quality on these little gems is so good, I can actually hear the singer sometimes pause and inhale before starting another line.  NEVER heard that with any headphones before.I'm ordering 3 more sets for our home computers.Can't pass them up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Headphones!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316649600, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2011"}
