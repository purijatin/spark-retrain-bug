For a few bucks, I couldn't care about the sound quality.I just got them today and plugged them into my home computer to test them out.And all I can say is WOW. The bass on these is *incredible*. I'm blown away.These are so good I'm going to keep them at home and buy another pair for the office!Amazing sound, extremely light weight, comfortable, and inexpensive. Can't ask for more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing Sound for the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1259193600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2009"}
