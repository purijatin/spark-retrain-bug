The sound is decent but I keep feeling like they're gonna fall off my head.  So not so good for running for me.  They do do fit into my iPhone and a generic MP3 player. I don't get the sense that they are really sturdy.  I'm gonna buy some over the ear phones as these on the ear earphones are just not working for me.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Panasonic headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1390176000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2014"}
