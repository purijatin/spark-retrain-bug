While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage, I don't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily. I figured five bucks, good reviews, worth a shot.These headphones sound bad. I do know these are quite cheap, but I've still heard better even for this price. The problem is the sound is plain tinny. Even with some equalization in the mix, I couldn't get \"good bass\" or a full sound out of these. Also the midranges, specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced. Another issue is the volume. I have to crank up about 70% of my recievers volume for moderate volume, and the iPod is even worse. Yes, they are cheap and comfy, but they sound as good as they cost. I've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones (MDRA110) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "You Must Be Kidding Me...", "unixReviewTime": 1191369600, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2007"}
