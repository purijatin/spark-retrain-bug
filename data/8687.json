I certainly knew I wasn't getting the best phones on the market at under $5 (!!!) - but I'll tell you what, I got a lot more than $5 worth. My ears aren't built for the ear-bud type phones, I always use over the ear type. As much as I listen to music on my MP3 player, this is a great little set. There's nothing I'm not hearing. I'm currently listening to \"The YES Album\" (still a favorite...you 'old' prog lovers know what I mean!) Their music has quite a range of sounds...and I'm hearing them all nicely...from grinding bass to delicate acoustic guitar...not to mention Jon's incredible voice.If you don't want to spend 25, 50, 75 or 100 bucks for phones for your player, then by all means, pick these up.P J Penrose", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ridiculously Low Price!", "unixReviewTime": 1337126400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2012"}
