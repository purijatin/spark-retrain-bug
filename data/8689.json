The sound is fine to me, but I am not an audiophile, nor I am using these inexpensive (under $5) headphones for any kind of audiophile experience.  I have about a dozen of these headphones that I use for all kinds of things around my homes and offices.  I use them to talk to folks on Skype or Google Voice on my laptop.  I use them for all kinds of other things too.  They are great for the cost.  They are much better than a set of Philips headphones that failed within 30 minutes of use.  Ihave a large head, and these are comfortable and fit well, unlike a set of cheap Sony headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Budget Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1344211200, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2012"}
