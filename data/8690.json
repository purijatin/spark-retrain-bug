But, these work fine.03-10-13These stereo headphones for the price are really great!  I thought they could have been a little louder but this might not be a headphones issue.They are mostly made of plastic (except for the wires and electronics of course) and are adjustable.  I'm not sure how long they will last (I have read about other people having these for many years).They can be used for the personal pocket talkers, however, this wasn't the intended use (other headphones are actually louder).  Just be aware that pocket talkers can be mono so you still only get sound on one side even though the headphones are stereo.  This can be fixed by plugging in a mono to stereo adapter into your pocket talker and then plugging these headphones into the adapter.PROS:  Price, model has been around for many years (something must be going right), lightweight, good bass sound for such a small thing, known brandCONS: Basically none, but they could be a little louder (this could be my device or my ears)OTHER: No volume control on the cord like some other headphones have but I knew this before buying", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Basic Headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1362873600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2013"}
