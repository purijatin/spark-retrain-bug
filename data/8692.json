The headband mechanism is simple and they sit ON the ears instead of cupping them (really bad things happen under heavy earphone cups, and even worse things happen with earbuds). I watch tv at night and don't really use them for music (although considering how much of what I listen to was recorded in the 78 era it might not matter) so I'm not in need of very high fidelity.Besides... How much fidelity do you need when you are hearing \"Matt. Be careful?\"Review by Tony as Plant Lady does not use earphones. Only her name is on our Amazon account, and we now purchase everything on this one account.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1354838400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2012"}
