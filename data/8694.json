While the sound is good, the fit is terrible.  Both failed within four months--likely due to stress on the cords.  They also don't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching, if that's what you had in mind. I believe they are under warranty, but at this price, it's not worth the postage to send them to Sony.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Waste of Money", "unixReviewTime": 1345766400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2012"}
