I like the light weight feeling of something like a headband to keep my bangs out of my face while working out.  I like to slip them off and let them rest around my neck when the flight attendant asks what I'd like to drink.  I keep a pair in each night stand, a pair in the gym bag, a pair at work.  For this price, I can (and DO) afford to buy them in bulk once a year.  Not because they only lasted a year, but rather because I found even more purposes and more places that they have made themselves invaluable.  Not to mention, they make GREAT stocking stuffers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love and lose 'em - buy 'em in bulk!", "unixReviewTime": 1309564800, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2011"}
