The quality of the sound is very good and they are tough enough to put up with less than perfect handling on my part.  I liked these so well I got a pair for my wife and she uses them frequently.  She's just as happy with her's as I am with mine.  Definitely recommend to others.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headset for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}
