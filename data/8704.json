Diamond \"Diamondback662\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewtext": "I recently perused one of the big chain stores for a set of inexpensive headphones. I've bought this type countless times in the past without problem but now it seems some stores are pushing customers to purchase overpriced China Junk at exorbitant prices...seriously? dr dre beats? or your other choice which is generally horrendous Coby brands. It seems the good but inexpensive headsets are dissapearing rather quickly from the shelves and aren't being restocked.These are very good headsets for less than what you'd pay in the store for Cobys.Buy them... Buy Several.Deep rich sound.Comfortable for an adult male that wears a size large hat.Standard RCA Minijack connection so they may not work in all Apple products as Apple alters their headphone jacks now.I'll be ordering a few more of these for spares at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth buying a few at this price.", "unixReviewTime": 1349222400, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2012"}
