Had I known I would like them so well I would have gotten 2 more sets--I've tried expensive wireless noise-cancelling headphones (too much static), ear buds (hurts my ears), other brands of headphones (didn't last long)--and I've got to say  The cord is long enough for my needs.  The earpieces swivel but were not too  \"delicate\" for my use.  I'm tickled to find these headphones!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressed.", "unixReviewTime": 1275696000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2010"}
