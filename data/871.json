So I will update when I get to test it out on the tablet as well. It works great, a bit slow in transfer items from my computer, but that's to be expected on my old laptop, so no problems there either. 16 gb, only 14 can be used on mine, but that is still more than enough space for me, since I only plan on storing apps, and ebooks on it, along with a few movies(maybe). Will look to buy this again if I need more room, or if my mom needs one.Update: Received Tablet today, and popped this in, works great, reads really fast! Great for holding my books, movies, and apps that I don't want taking space on the tablet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Memory for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"}
