I tried them on several products...different mp3 players, laptop computer, desktop computer, and even my GPS unit. The sound was very good in each instance and responsive to equalization changes made on my mp3 players. Decent bass response with clear tones otherwise. I recommend these headphones highly for good sound and over-the-ear comfort.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good deal for decent headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1290297600, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2010"}
