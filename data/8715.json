I am very picky when it comes to sound but these little things sound great. I still can't believe they can sound that good. I use them at least 1 to 3 hours every day checking the web for new music or watching some movies and I don't even know I'm wearing them most of the time. They do have a tendency to slip a little but just tighten the headband and they should be fine. The cord isn't that long so don't expect to get up and walk around while working on your computer. They're made of plastic and aren't meant for little children to play with or use or they'll surely end up broken. The  pros definitely out way the cons on these plus they're only $5 so order them,they're handy to have if you're tired of earaches and still want good sound.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for the Computer", "unixReviewTime": 1290556800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2010"}
