I needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it. I've had this microSD card for a few months now, and it has been great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reliable data storage", "unixReviewTime": 1391472000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2014"}
