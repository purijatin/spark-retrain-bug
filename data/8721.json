I have been using these headphones for more than 4 years. I am currently using my 3rd piece and that's because I sometimes fall asleep while watching movies and end up breaking it!The sound quality is excellent. I have used the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 earphones and the Panasonic quality is light years ahead.. Panasonic headphones are super light and that causes zero irritation to the ears.I have compared sound quality with Sony noise cancellation headphones which cost 80-100$ and believe me, they are worthless. They are heavy, too hard on people with bigger ears and sound quality is no where near the Panasonic.All in all, this product is a clear winner. My last piece was bought 5 months back and they have same quality as before. Put them on and relax to enjoy wonderful sound quality for really low price.Last but not the least - don't  get fooled by the low price, because this product is totally worth much more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headphones - exceeds cost - quality comparison", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2013"}
