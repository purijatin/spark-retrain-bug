And the fact they got to me so quick...very cool. Im sure the Dre. Beats headphones are way better, but i love these for my everyday use headphones. The sound is REALLY crisp and you can feel the bass, good enough. They are very loud too, sometimes almost too loud, if that makes sense. I can never hear someone trying to talk to me. haha. Oh well. Snag these up!:)UPDATE: June, 2012. Since first ordering these, I have ordered 2 more pairs, totaling 3 pairs, My first pair still work great, and ive ordered 1 for my wife a few months back, and just ordered another pair for work. I am still amazed at how well they work for being so affordable. I love em.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great  Headphones!", "unixReviewTime": 1318982400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2011"}
