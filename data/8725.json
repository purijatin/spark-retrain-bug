There's a time and place for most everything including headphones and these Panasonics for under $5 are amazingly effective for what I ask them to do which is, in the main, keep me entertained while going through my daily one hour workouts at the gym, mated to my ipod mini.  I just don't like those ear buds which most people use these days as there's something about sticking them directly into the ear and hearing canal that has never been comfortable for me.  Perhaps you feel the same?  Anyway, back to the review:The sound quality is very good, adjustable features to one's head are excellent and the light weight doesn't interfere with the work at hand.  Plus, unlike other headphones I've tried (and rejected) for my main purpose of these, don't heat my head to the point of gushing out too much perspiration which would interfere with my focus and overall comfort level.I just ordered a second pair to keep in reserve.  At this price for this quality, you can get all you want to hold in reserve or alternate which is what I plan on doing, rotating them to spread out the normal wear and tear.  They feel good, adjust easily, stay in place, look good and sound good.  The best $5 you're likely to spend?  If these headphones aren't it, they're definitely amongst the top candidates.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding VALUE and they get the job done", "unixReviewTime": 1290816000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2010"}
