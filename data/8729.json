It's super-light, decently durable (I threw it into a box of other electronics and put stuff on top of it and it wasn't broken when I fished it out), and a novice won't hear how mediocre the sound quality is. I bought this so I could use the headphone out jack in my mixer to listen for any hissing in the sound and it does just that.tl;dr - THIS is the $5 pair of headphones you've been looking for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's what you're looking for", "unixReviewTime": 1344988800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2012"}
