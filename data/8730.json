They fall out almost as soon as I stand up.  So when running I use these over-the-head headphones.  My old ones broke, so I looked online for a decent pair.  I found these at a dirt-cheap price and was somewhat skeptical.Well, after training for two marathons and running hundreds of miles, these headphones held up very well and I have no complaints.  They stay in position even while I'm running, and the sound is very good.  I don't need any fancy bass or other audio features.  I just want to listen to the music on my phone.Everything worked great!  A very good value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value, good quality product", "unixReviewTime": 1343001600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2012"}
