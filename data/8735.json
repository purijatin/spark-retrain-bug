Alas and alack, it was not meant to be. About 7 months of regular use led to the demise of the headphones, which apparently should be treated with great care and attention. The earpieces came off one at a time, and then the arm broke off.Until this happened, I would have sworn that they were not only a $5 cheap piece of &$&%^ but now, its clear that in this day and age there are no bargains...you just get what you pay for!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Great for the 8 months that they were alive", "unixReviewTime": 1324425600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2011"}
