My kids are not very good about being able to keep ear-bud style headphone on, so I thought it might be better to have some on-the-ear style headphones. The headphones were a bit large for smaller heads, but they were able to sit back on the airplane seats and let the headphones rest on the seat. When they wanted to lean forward, the headphones would balance backwards and stay in position.In general these worked great - reasonable loudness and clarity (for the price), lightweight, durable, and great price. Even the three year old liked them and that made the flight easier. I would note that they do not fold, but since I am giving these to the kids to use, they are more likely to break than get lost so I prefer more durability (non-folding). I would definitely buy them again if the need arises.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Quality, Lightweight, Low Price - Great Choice For Kids", "unixReviewTime": 1386374400, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2013"}
