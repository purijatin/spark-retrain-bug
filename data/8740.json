They're much too large for a child's head, the volume is too low (I didn't mind this for my kids), the sound quality at it's best is still poor, and there is horrible static every time the plug moves in the headphone jack.  They're cheap, but I wouldn't bother with these even if they were free.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Junk", "unixReviewTime": 1399420800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2014"}
