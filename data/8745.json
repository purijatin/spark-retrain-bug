These work just as well for me as $50 headphones.These work great with my iPod.  Won't work with an iPhone (or other cell phone), which uses a different connector (4 connections instead of 3) to support a microphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great quality, comfort and price", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2014"}
