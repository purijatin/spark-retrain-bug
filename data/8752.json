My old headset, which looks very similar, could be worn from the back of the head/neck. This means that when I go out walking or anywhere else where I want to wear a hat, I cannot use this headset.As for the \"increased bass\" -- I did an A-B comparison with my old headset and they sounded very similar in quality overall. If the RP-HT21 has more bass, my impression is that they simply attenuated the high frequencies (making the bass more predominant), as the maximum overall volume from the RP-HT21 is not as high as with my old headset. This means that in a noisy environment, you may not be able to be able to hear it.Bottom line: for indoor use (no hats) in not overly noisy environments, this is a good headset, especially for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1244592000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2009"}
