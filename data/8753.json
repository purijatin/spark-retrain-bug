They reminded me of the ones that came with the old portable CD players.My biggest complaint is that they don't fit snug on my head so the sound volume is very low. The earpiece is made of foam padding. If I press the ear cups to my ear, the sound is ample and very clear. But I wouldn't want to hold my hands in that position for very long.I plan to invest in a good full sized set of headphones to get the fit I want. I am not concerned too much about portability since I usually listen to music in my recliner. If I were into aerobics I would probably stick to ear buds. For my listening pleasure, I would prefer padded ear cups that surround the ear and keep out noise.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lightweight Panasonic headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1317427200, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2011"}
