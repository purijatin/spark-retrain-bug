In the past couple of years I have owned this item, had good service from it, and felt satisfied even when a part broke. This time, it cracked into two pieces within the first hour of ordinary use without any particular strain - it is possible that I received a headset with aged, fragile plastic. Amazon honored my request to return and credit the cost of purchase.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "was good now fragile", "unixReviewTime": 1395100800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2014"}
