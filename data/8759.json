The Panasonic has very good sound, is lightweight and pretty easy to wear.  The cable is long, which works for me since I just don't like the earbud sets that have a very short cord length. For the money, this is a good product that is well made and sturdy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great, inexpensive set of headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1365465600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013"}
