These headphones are terrific. The sound quality is amazing and crystal clear.  The headphones are so comfortable I can wear them for a long period of time without ear pain. I also wear them while using my elyptical machine and they stay in place well being so light. The only thing I have noticed is when I work out with them my ears get a little sweaty but not enough to complain about.  Get them, you won't regret it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If I could give them 10 stars I would", "unixReviewTime": 1350691200, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2012"}
