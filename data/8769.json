Finney", "helpful": [558, 574], "reviewtext": "If you want value for your money, if you lose your headphones too often, if you wear out the cord, or plug on your headphones, these are the ones to get.  I have a couple of MP3 players I use at work daily and with them I wear my headphones constantly.  I either lose or wear them out whether they are more expensive or cheaper.  I was absolutely startled at the bass that came our of these phones.  It is deep, rich and accurate.  Overall sound is better than a pair I once had that cost me about 10 times as much.  Knowing that I would either wear them out or lose them I bought 4 pairs this time.  I will definitely buy more when the need arises.  An excellent deal, I highly recommend these phones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Bang For Your Buck", "unixReviewTime": 1142294400, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2006"}
