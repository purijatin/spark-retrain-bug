As advertised, these headphones produce a lot of bass - almost too much bass.  They're pretty comfortable, with earpieces that swivel slightly, an adjustable headband, and foam earpads.  However, the headband is plastic, and doesn't feel very sturdy.  The sound is great for $5, but sound pretty bad compared to my $50 Sennheisers.  You get what you pay for.Pros: Good sound for $5.  Lots of Bass.  Pretty comfortable.Cons: Bad sound compared to more expensive headphones.  Somewhat flimsy.  Could be too much bass.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Impressive for Price, Better than Stock Earbuds", "unixReviewTime": 1270166400, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2010"}
