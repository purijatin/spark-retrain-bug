These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package.  Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though.  These headphones don't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in-ear (ear buds) do either.  I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head.  The more you sweat and move the more they slip.  It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set.  Bottom line:  If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones...especially for the money - you just can't.  Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating, even yard work, then go with something like the Philips SH390 (inexpinsive around $13.00) that are snug.  Again, you can not beat the Panasoni RP-HT21 for the price - just be worned if you attempt to work out with them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY BUT THEY SLIP OFF OF HEAD", "unixReviewTime": 1306281600, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2011"}
