They have been discontinued, and were one of the absolute best headphones I have ever used, even though they were cheapo $10 ones.  Unfortunately, thesePanasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Portdo not sound anything like the RP-HG10 model, and don't even strike me as being made for music.  They also don't fit flat on the ears.  I think they would be best as computer headphones when watching news videos and such online.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor Panasonics . . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1403913600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2014"}
