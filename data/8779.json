I find ear-buds to be uncomfortable, and the sound to be of poor quality (no bass whatsoever and low quality high notes). The big ear-muff style headphones sound great, but I don't like how they look on me, nor do I like the fact that you can't hear any other noises (like someone trying to get your attention). They are also not really as good for wearing while doing something physical, such as jogging, and they are too big to be able to have them on while your head is sideways on a pillow or a chair, etc.But this style of headphones is a nice compromise right in the middle.In my experience for a couple months of frequent use of these headphones, with all kinds of music and audio, I have found them to sound very decent. Compared to other brands and models of this style of headphones that I have owned, these have a very decent amount of bass in them, significantly more so than my last pair, and the high notes also sound nice and clear. They fit well on my head too. For what they are, they do a very decent job.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Inexpensive, decent sounding headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1397692800, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2014"}
