Probably a good thing for my ears.OK for treadmill, bike, or rower, but impossible for strength training - they slip around if you are not upright.  (Edited to add that today, as I am still waiting for my next try at headphones for the gym to arrive, I discovered that if I push the headband back on my head, as opposed to straight up, they are much more stable.)Headband a bit large for my head, even at smallest extension.  (On edit - barely the right size if I push them back a bit.  Anybody with a smaller head than mine would be out of luck.)If you are going to be upright and not moving vigorously, they should be fine, and they sure are cheap!On edit, raised my rating to four stars - they are quite amazing for the price, and comfortable now that I've discovered how to wear them.  Don't expect high volume, though.On edit, including a link to another headset I ordered.  Am still deciding which one I like best for the gym.Sennheiser  HD 202 Dynamic Headphones", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very nice for the price, but not ideal for gym", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}
