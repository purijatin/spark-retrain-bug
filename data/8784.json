These things can't compete with better quality headphones, such as my old Sony MDR-V150s (which are no longer available at reasonable prices, sadly), but they sound alright, and are comfortable.If you are looking for a cheap pair of headphones that don't go in your ear and you won't feel bad about when you or your kid inevitably breaks them, this is a good buy. If you are looking for audiophile headphones, why are you looking at $5 headphones???", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for - a good thing, for the right price.", "unixReviewTime": 1334793600, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2012"}
