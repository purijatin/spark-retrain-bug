Ballard", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I have not had these very long, but they are doing the job, which was to carry on the plane and do other little listening jobs here and there.. I carry a tablet, and these work very well for that.. I chose them mostly on the price point, not the sound quality.. My earlier model got broken, so I had to replace.. This is what I got.. I say could be better because it would be great if the ear piece would rotate enough to store more in a flat mode.. My earlier model did.. That was great for transporting.. Is this a big issue, no, but is great when I have it... So, for the money, this works.. At this price, it is just something to listen with. I listen to electronic books, so there is no need for high quality to do this.. I would buy these again, if I break these, or I would just buy whatever I found.. Not that big of a deal for what I do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, but could be improved", "unixReviewTime": 1403222400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2014"}
