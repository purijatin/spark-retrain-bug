No headphones that I've ever seen or purchased for that amount of money were good.  But when I plugged them in to my Mp3, I was surprised. They sounded GOOOD!! I couldn't believe it so I had my sister try them out. She loved them too! And she could barely believe how good and bass-ey they sounded...especially after I told her the price! So long story short, get these...you will be pleasantly surprised like I was! Oh! The only reason why I gave them four stars is because they have a hard time staying on my head. They slide off a lot, and I have a pretty good sized head. But other than that, they are very good quality!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Smoothest Bass I've EVER heard from a lightweight headphone!", "unixReviewTime": 1215648000, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2008"}
