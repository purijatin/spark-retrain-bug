I also bought the Sennheiser HD 202 along with them. I returned the Sennheisers within a month because they gave me blisters but I kept these ones. That should vouch for how good these headphones really are.Their sound reproduction is excellent and they are very light-weight and comfortable. My Sansa earphones slip off whenever they get a chance, but these stay on my head. Okay, so I don't jog or run with these on, but a very fast walk does not dislodge them. The bass is excellent, the mid-range is very lively and the high-frequencies are clear. They match the Sennheiser HD 202 in sound quality and are less than 1/4th the price. I feel like these headphones were probably the best value for all the $5s I have ever spent online.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sound as good as Sennheisers with 100x more comfort", "unixReviewTime": 1280707200, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2010"}
