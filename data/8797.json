That was about 1-1/2 weeks ago.and I haveN'T seen them since. (the phones, that is; I always see sons at mealtimes)I should have bought (3) THREE sets 'in self-defense'.Whichever son I find that currently has them, tells me that they will be on my deskwhen they are finished. Seems I just barely miss 'my turn'. (always)My old buds are still OK! ....  BUT .... Will buy MORE ...
