My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good and price worthy", "unixReviewTime": 1368748800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2013"}
