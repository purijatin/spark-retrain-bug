I just don't like how they squeeze my head while the speakers turn toward the back of my head. I want them to fit on my ears, not turn outward toward the back of my head. The back of my head isn't listening to the music, my ears are!! I'll have to look into modding these a bit. Good sound, bad design, NOT comfortable.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sound is nice, but design is poor", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"}
