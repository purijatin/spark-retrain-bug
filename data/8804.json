The overall sound is surprisingly rich for a pair of headphones this price (I paid about $6.50).To put the price/quality in perspective; I feel like the next significant step up from these would be something like the Sony MDR ZX300 headphones, which I purchased for about $25.00 and sound significantly better. But I doubt you can do better than these Panasonics for less than $10.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A suberb pair of headphones considering the price", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2014"}
