It was the best decision of my life (so far). The headphones still work despite the many times I dropped them. They are lightweight as the name states. Also, they don't squeeze my ears like most headphones do. These earphones are very gentle on my ears. They are very light, so the top of my head does not hurt from long hours of usage.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "wonderful! wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"}
