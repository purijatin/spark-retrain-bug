Sound fidelity, noise cancelling, etc, did not matter to them.  Kinivo bluetooth headphones were expensive but uncomfortable behind the head and they did not want the trouble of having to charge the battery.  These headphones are cheap, light, long cord, and pretty good sound as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good value product", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2014"}
