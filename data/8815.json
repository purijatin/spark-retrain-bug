I probably use them 90% of the time because they have some other important attributes to think about.  They fit into a shallow drawer, unlike a lot of full size phones.  You can stuff them into a coat pocket.  I have found them to be very sturdy.  And I find them very comfortable because of their lightness and because the earpiece is small.  Also, I have a big head and have trouble with some good headphones that feel like they are strangling my ears.  These have a big adjustment range.  These are a great buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good budget headphone with specific uses", "unixReviewTime": 1326240000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2012"}
