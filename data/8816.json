I only like traditional headphone. It is used five days in a week for more than 40 minutes during workout. It sometimes get wet with sweat. It works like charm. No issue with loose connection to speaker or pin.I would highly recommend and buy some more as spare. I have tried many others like Coby, Sony but this turned out to be best and cost effective traditional headphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cheap and very good quality", "unixReviewTime": 1348704000, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2012"}
