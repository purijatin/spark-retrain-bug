They aren't the most rugged feeling headphones, but I wasn't expecting them to be.  They sound very good though.  I tried them on my Android phone and my stereo and they really have a good full sound; the mids and highs are clear without being harsh and there is very good bass (I had to turn the lows down on my EQ down because it was a bit boomy).  They actually have decent sound isolation as well for on ear headhones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprisingly good for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1359763200, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2013"}
