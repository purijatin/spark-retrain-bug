Also, in my experience, price has little if anything to do with durability.  I paid under $10 for these, they have put in many many 'miles' and when they stop working I'll buy another pair.  And I'll be damned if something I've paid 30 times the price for has been remotely near even twice the quality.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great value!", "unixReviewTime": 1398816000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2014"}
