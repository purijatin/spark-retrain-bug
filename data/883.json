Bought it to replace a SanDisk 64gb MicroSDHC card that was prone to have problems.After approx 2 months, the card stopped reading in the phone.  I tried other cards and they worked in the phone.  The Kingston MicroSDHC card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer, using different SD card readers.  I can't format it, can't even read it in the Disk Management viewer, and can't do anything with the card now.  Thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesn't make me happy at all.  JUNK card.FYI, I put the 64gb SanDisk card back in and that's been working great ever since.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "After 2 months, the card is DEAD", "unixReviewTime": 1393113600, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2014"}
