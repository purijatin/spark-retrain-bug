These over the ear headphones feel pretty comfortable and have pretty good bass for such a cheap pair of headphones.  I am expecting them to get damaged on the trail so did not want an expensive set.Sure enough.  Headband snapped in half during first hike I took it on.  Ended up removing the ear peices and cables from the plastic headband and seems they would still work ok if I could find a way to mount them properly.  Next headphone set I am trying is even lighter kind of like earbuds but they sit just outside of the ear.  They are even lighter than this set, has pretty good sound, and the headband appears to be made out of a much more flexible material.  SO hopefully I will have better luck with that set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Sound for Price", "unixReviewTime": 1331510400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2012"}
