So my wife gets a new pair of headphones at least once a month.  For under $5, these are great.  The sound quality is actually not bad and sounds better than 2 other pairs of $20+ headphones I have purchased recently.  These are superior to the low end $5 Sony models, much better sound and more comfortable.  Cord length is acceptable for laptop and mp3 use.Honestly, if they made one of these with an inline volume control I would use it for the TV (with an extension cord).  I like them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1315526400, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2011"}
