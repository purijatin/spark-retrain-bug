I had been using a $10 Koss over-the-ear headphone from Walmart.  This one beats it hands down.  I hear sounds that I haven't heard/noticed before on the Koss, my car stereo, my Altec Lansing VS2621 PC speaker, or my Harman Kardon HK395 PC speaker.  I listen to all kinds of music: pop, folk, piano, country, hip pop, soul... this headphone produces wonderful sound for all of them.  Highly recommended as a budget headphone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best budget headphone ever", "unixReviewTime": 1326067200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2012"}
