GeForce2 is a great card but it does not compare to the oomph of Voodoo5. Yes its true that nVidia recently bought over 3Dfx but that only proves that nVidia knows the potential of their patents. The dual VSA100 chips give you a LOT of juice for the programs that actually use the power of Voodoo5.Keep in mind that you will, invariably, notice a fine difference in everything you see, including web sites. The colors are &quot;truer&quot; and more vibrant. But like a new hammer do not try to view everything using the FSAA (Full Scene Anti Aliasing). One the best games I can suggest that will allow you the enjoy the revolutionary architecture of V5 is Diablo2. The game is breathtaking with the FSAA and the T-Buffer renders cinematic interludes so beautifully, you gotta see it to believe.As someone who really does not count himself in either the nVidia or 3dfx camp, take it from me that Voodoo5 is the best card you can buy out there now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clearly the best video card till now", "unixReviewTime": 977356800, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2000"}
