This thing had it all, and probably can still hang with the lower end ones available right now, with 64mb of memory, 350mhz ram dac ect...One of the best graphics cards ever built. Only the 6000 version of this was bigger, but this was a great one, highly recommended to all who need a decent card for an older system. I have owned the voodoo 3 2000 and the Voodoo3 3500tv, all are still working and excellent, this is also amongst the crowd. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the last in a line of legends", "unixReviewTime": 1165795200, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2006"}
