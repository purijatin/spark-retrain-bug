You may find it difficult to get acceptable frame rates with 4x FSAA in some of the most punishing games, but when you can use it the results are mind boggling.  It even lets  you force ANY Glide games to run in 32 bit color.  Anybody up for some  Unreal Tournament in 32 bit color with ultra smooth &quot;Glide&quot;  framerates?  I thought so.  As far as raw speed goes, the Voodoo 5 is  technically just a hair behind the GeForce2 cards, yet does it really  matter?  With the Voodoo 5 you get REAL FSAA and 32 bit Glide support at a  slightly cheaper price.  Finally, the hardware DVD assist does a fine job.  I'm watching movies in 1152x864 with no frame dropping.  Previously I had a  TNT(1) running DVD's at 800x600 and the Software decoder relied entirely on  my P III 450.  It was really sad to see the Matrix with severe frame  dropping.  As a test, I rented it again and it plays perfectly with the  Voodoo 5.  You've seen the benchmarks, you've seen the hype, now see it for  yourself.  You can't go wrong with this card.  Naturally, better cards are  always on the way, but you have to choose to buy sometime or you will be  waiting forever.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Damn fine piece of hardware.", "unixReviewTime": 959472000, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2000"}
