IF you buy this product new it was the best of its time! The only downfall that you MIGHT have are the GPU fans (x2) that come with the card. They can be somewhat unreliable from what I hear BUT I STILL have this card in my legacy rig and the original fans are still running so I wouldn't worry about it so much. Just make sure to keep up with the maintenance and check your fans regularly like you should and you won't have a problem!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Epic for its time!", "unixReviewTime": 1336780800, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2012"}
