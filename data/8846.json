That's right.  Nothing to set, all games work, glide and Direct3D supported.  This 3d card is great.  Just install it in the AGP slot, attach the power source, turn on the computer and you are there.  Software installation is the easiest.How does it work with 3d games?  Read the title! :)  Clockwork.  It is perfect.  No game will give you one single complaint about it.  NFS IV does not list it as supported, but believe me, it works perfectly.  I play NFS with the highest video settings and it runs smooth (have in mind I own an Athlon processor 650 MHz with 128 MB).Despite its incredible and flawless performance, there is a problem:  When I installed it, I had to move one of my hard drives because this card is so big it wouldn't fit with the hard drive in its original position.  Therefore, you might need to upgrade your box before installing, but hey! it is totally worth it.  The best of its kind.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clockwork!", "unixReviewTime": 979862400, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2001"}
