It was fine and I could even play  demanding games today like Unreal Tournament and Half Life with good frame  rates and resolution.  Then I went out and bought a Voodoo5500 AGP with 64  MB of RAM.  I have no idea what  the difference technically compared to a  VooDoo2, except that the VooDoo5500 has 2 chips.  I played my games that I  always play and guess what?  I found no difference at all except that I  could play games in higher resolutions like 1024x768 in 32 bit mode and it  would be smooth.  But, it couldn't handle Ground Control in 32 bit mode on  1024x768.  It was too choppy.  But other then that, all my other games that  I play: rogue spear, half life, deus ex, indiana jones and the infernal  machine, prince of persia 3d, motorcross madness 2, urban chaos, etc etc...  all those games work super smooth in super high resolutions.  But I would  recommend that if you have a voodoo2 or voodoo 3 - you won't need this card  cause the voodoo 2/3 is good enough probably for another year or 2 years.  I had no problem installing this thing and it worked with no problems for  me.
