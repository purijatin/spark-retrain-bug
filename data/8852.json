He wanted to be able to see all of our backyard from the house.  We have a Koi pond and birdfeeders so attract a lot of wildlife.  He is really enjoying these.  No complaints about construction.  He and I recommend for general purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great binoculars for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2014"}
