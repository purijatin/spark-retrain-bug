They are big but that was my mistake. The lenses focus very well and it helps me see animals that are farther away. I felt like I was able to get within feet of elk, moose, big horn sheep, and bears. I'd buy another smaller pair to take with me hiking from the same company.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very good entry level binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1383264000, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2013"}
