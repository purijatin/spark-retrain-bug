These focus easily, have an adequate field of vision for my purposes, and let in good light when games are played after dark, under the stadium lights.  Vision through my old pair noticeably darkened during evening games.  My only complaint is that the focus control has more play in it than I'd like, but it hasn't overly affected my ability to call games.  All-in-all, a good buy for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for My Announcer Duties", "unixReviewTime": 1365638400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2013"}
