They are not for backpacking type hiking any long distance, too bulky for that. I love the instant focus mechanism, very quick and easy to use. I like also the roll down eye-cups, which allow using with eyeglasses left on. The soft sided case is 'OK' and it does come with lens caps for each lens, but they do fall off rather easily, but that is a nit.I could not find these in stores, so on line was the only way. I have a much older pair of Bushnell and these have similar feel to them.The only negative is twice I thought the left and right lens viewed image did not line up, but then I reset the focus all in or out (ie near vs distance) and it was ok again. So, not sure if one side sticks slightly or it was my imagination - I could not get it to do the misalignment when trying, but it did happen twice in about 15 minutes of usage. Not a biggie nor enough to make me want to return them.The magnification and field of view is just right for watching birds, wildlife etc.Net, net - easily worth $30, with a feel like they should last a lifetime with care.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Heavy weight quality feeling binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1386979200, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2013"}
