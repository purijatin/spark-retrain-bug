My wife and I love them!  They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other.  We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene.  They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.I would definitely recommend them to a friend and we might even get a second pair for the travel trailer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big Bang for the Buck", "unixReviewTime": 1318982400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2011"}
