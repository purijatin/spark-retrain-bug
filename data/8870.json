Sharp, easy to focus but, best of all, very bright image. I gambled on the junk Vivitar 7x50s for slightly less and they were a joke--hard to focus, very dark image. So I bought this bushnell for barely a ten spot more money. Wow, very bright image, focus dead on and easy. As others have said, this is all the binocular a casual user will need. My wife's 10x25 Nikon for twice the price (also on Amazon) are very nice and light weight especially if you need more power. But these Bushnell's are the best value for sure. Bright and clear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent and good value too", "unixReviewTime": 1289952000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2010"}
