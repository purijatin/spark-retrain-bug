The are small, but not so small that every movement you make gets transferred to the optics making them very hard to use.  The rocker focus mechanism is super easy to use, and I cannot image using bino's without it anymore.  They have a very large diameter optic, so everything is very bright, clear and sharp.  Very important if you plan on using them indoors, at night or on a cloudy day at the stadium.  It comes with front and back caps, and a nice soft case to protect them.  For $25.00 or so, I don't see how you can beat them.  I highly recommend them.
