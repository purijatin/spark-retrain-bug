In fact, I never was able to get a satisfactory focus with it.- both lenses displayed significant distortion around the outside edges- It was impossible to clearly focus on anything beyond 50 yards- the quick focus mechanism frequently failed to work and took a few tries to adjustUnfortunately I had some similar problems with recently purchased Bushnell 20x50 wide angle binoculars. Bushnell used to be an inexpensive and decent brand.  Not anymore.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor quality control", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}
