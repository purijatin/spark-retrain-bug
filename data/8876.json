But wow do they seem flimsy. The parts that slide in and out to focus are supposed to slide both sides together, right? Well nothing is rigid, so one side can get ahead of the other by quite a bit. Both sides will get pushed in, changing the focus completely, just from holding the binoculars up against your face lightly. The little rocker thing you adjust with your fingers to change focus seems pretty cheapo and fragile. They might be OK for disposable situations, but I would not buy these binoculars again.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Flimsy", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}
