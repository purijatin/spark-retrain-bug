Picture is clear, sharp, and stable.  Lets lots of light in, and the weight of the binoculars helps you hold it steady.  I like the one touch focus much easier to use than dials.  Highly recommended for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1355184000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2012"}
