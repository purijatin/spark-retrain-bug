Cox", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewtext": "I bought the 32 gig. card for just that purpose, My Samsung phone, takes as good pictures as most cameras. In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4. I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory. I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera. I like to take moving photos with my Samsung, and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory, now I don't have to worry and running out of memory", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I take lots of pictures with my Galaxy 4", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014"}
