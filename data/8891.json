They were such a great deal, I figured we should both have one.  We have them on hooks right by the front door.  That way, anytime we see a bird out the window, we can grab the binocs and check it out.  We've also brought them on a couple outings.  They are easy to carry around and are of excellent quality!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for backyard bird watching!", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}
