A good &#34;BIRDING&#34; Binocular, I use the for &#34;BOATING&#34;, they don't take up a lot of room like larger 7 x 50 binoculars do, at 7 x 35 they have the same view as 7 x 50 (you won't be able to tell the DIF bet. 35 and 50 Fld of view). If they go overboard, it's NOT a big loss. excellent gift for a &#34;BOATER&#34; !", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple, clear, crisp image", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2014"}
