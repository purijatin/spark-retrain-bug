Bushnell is a well trusted name and I am glad that I went with this pair of Binoculars. If you are looking for a great pair of binoculars at a GREAT price these are for you. Excellent clarity and I absolutely love the &#34;insta focus&#34; these have. I hike the Adirondacks in NY and can't wait to take these out when I am on the summit of a mountain.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "EXCELLENT!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1369267200, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2013"}
