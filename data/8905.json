I am uninformed about optics or the comparative merits of other brands and sizes of binoculars.  I use this pair to see across a lake, about 2000-3000 feet and I can see the individual leaves on the trees.  The binoculars are easy to adjust and a very nice toy.  Sturdy enough that I let my 8 yr old play with them under supervision.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bushnell Falcon Binoculars", "unixReviewTime": 1369526400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2013"}
