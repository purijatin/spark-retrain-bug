MY DURACELL LASTED 3 DAYS. THE ICONS, BUTTONS AND MENUS DO NOT COME NATURALLY. LEAVE IT TO CANON TO MAKE YOU BUY THE ESSENTIAL RECHARGABLE BATTERY SEPARATELY. FROM NOW ON I STAY WITH SONY. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE AND THE BATTERY LASTS FOREVER.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "NOT SO INTUITIVE CAMERA WITH A BATTERY FETISH", "unixReviewTime": 992995200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2001"}
