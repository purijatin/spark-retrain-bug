The camera takes fantastic pictures that are consistently clear, ungrainy, and in focus, even in odd lighting conditions. The metering system is great, as is the autofocus and the telephoto; all work near-flawlessly.The S20's greatest strengths is its simplicity and its size. Although it does not offer advanced features (such shutter-speed priority, full manual, etc.) that some of the Nikons and more expensive Canons do, even an inexperienced camera user (digital or not) will have no problem taking great photographs. All of the moderately complicated features on the Canon such as macro-mode, toggling the flash, and red-eye reduction are as easy as hitting a clearly labelled, obvious button. Additionally, the S20 is just like a &quot;regular old camera.&quot; There are no bizare swivling things like on the Nikons, and more importantly, the camera is small enough to fit easily in a small bag or large pocket.Please note that in addition to the camera itself, you will have to buy the battery recharger and, unless you want to be limited to a few megs, an extra PC card which will both add some money to your purchase. Still, for the camera you get, the extra purchases are not a big deal.Overall, a fantastic little camera.
