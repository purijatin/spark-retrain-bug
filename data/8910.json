This is simply an incredible deal. I've had years of experience in photography. (...) This little S-20 is so neat. It will fit into your pants pocket. And, in an instant it's ready to shoot a picture. The images it produces are extremely sharp and detailed. It allows manual control of several functions incl.: image size, flash, zoom focus, light balance, and many other items. This thing will take any CompactFlash brand card you shove into it, just hit the format key & it's ready to go. It will take a microdrive, which is something i haven't tried yet, but it sounds very interesting. And, if the rechargeable battery runs out, you can power up with off the shelf disposable batteries. (...)the main reason I like this camera is that it's the toughest little thing around. You can drop it on the ground, pick it up & it will still work.  I've already dropped my S-20 several times without any negative results. Well, enough already. If you want a tough little camera, that fits in a shirtpocket & takes extremely sharp pictures, then this one is a no - brainer. I guess the only reason they're selling this for so lttle is that it's going to be discontinued. If that's the case, then get it. It's a classic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing deal", "unixReviewTime": 1008547200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2001"}
