Shortly after I upgraded to a Palm III, then moved to the Visor Deluxe in March, 2000.  I really enjoyed the flexibility of the Visor add-ons, but felt limited on the software side.  The Jornada has been wonderful!  Syncing capabilities are right there with the Visor, though the option settings aren't as clearly defined as they could be.  Writing recognition is head &amp; shoulders above the Visor, the word completion option is a tremendous time saver.  The display doesn't hit the 16 bit category, but it is still impressive.  Outside it is difficult to view without fiddling with the settings.  The display catches a lot of attention from onlookers. Software is a huge advantage.  Pocket  Word &amp; Pocket Streets have been a huge help(this critique was written in Pocket Word).  Small display size makes the Excel version difficult to use.  The inclusion of Outlook 2000 is an added bonus.  I look forward to adding Pocket Powerpoint. I was very concerned about the lack of flexibility on the power system (the Visor uses AAA's), however the Lithium Ion battery holds it's own very well.  I am getting well over six hours of operation time between charges. I installed a 56k modem and the results have been great.  Setup was a snap &amp; operation speeds have been impressive.  Power adapter is pretty much required with modem use. There is a noticeable lag in program opening compared to the Palm OS, but nothing that's going to cause me heartburn. Though there are a few disadvantages with the HP and CE 3, they are far outweighed by the long list of advantages.  It is a definite buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Jornada 548 replaces Visor Deluxe", "unixReviewTime": 970185600, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2000"}
