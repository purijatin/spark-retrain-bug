Gerber", "helpful": [13, 16], "reviewtext": "I tried the HP Jornada 548 for a day or two and returned it in favor of keeping my RIM Blackberry 957.  I've had every generation of CE device plus a number of Palms (latest is Palm Vx).  I've found both to be much too big, too difficult to communicate with and too pull-your-information-oriented for easy use and on-body transport, especially when a wireless modem is added.  The Blackberry has a built-in QWERTY keyboard and wireless modem and is about the size of a Palm Vx.  The Jornada similarly outfitted with an OmniSky modem and Targus Keyboard approaches the weight of a small laptop, occupies nearly as much space and costs nearly as much.  The Palm Vx similarly outfitted is nearly as heavy, large and costly.  Couple lightness and small size with the RIM's ability to automatically accept e-mail pushed from ISP POP3 or Microsoft Exchange servers and you've got a near ideal go-anywhere communication tool.  Add Go-America's Web access service and you can even browse the Internet.I appreciate all of the nice features of the Jornada, but trying to build a laptop into a 5.5&quot; by 3&quot; case leads to too many compromises that, for me, outweigh the nicities.I should note that the screen of the Jornada flickered when the OmniSky modem was transmitting or receiving.  Most likely due to the fact that the modem and the Jornada share the power in each of their batteries with each other.  That was the deal breaker that led me to return the Jornada and the OmniSky modem.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Pocket PCs and Palms Too Big", "unixReviewTime": 994896000, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2001"}
