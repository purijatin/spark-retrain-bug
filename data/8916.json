As a HP 12C user since 1978, I could not image buying a hand-help device without them.I wound up with much more.1.  The color screen is is sharp and clear.2.  Syncronizing the machine is easy.  I have my Jornada synchronzied to my computer at work and home, making it easy to keep my contact and calendar on both machines up-to-date.  I previously owned the 200LX whose motherboard failed.  I, of course, did not have a backup plan, so I literally lost two years of my life.  That will not be the problem with this machine.3.  The reader is the greatest.  I am now addicted to the world of e-books.Plan to buy a flash card.  You can never have enough memory.I never thought I would say this, but here goes.  I could not live without this machine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Machine", "unixReviewTime": 993168000, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2001"}
