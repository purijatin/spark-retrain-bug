I tried every other gadget and daytimer imaginable and this has worked the best. The things I like:1. Excellent file compatibility with the MS Office suite. It sync's very well with Outlook. 2. Combined with a portable Targus keyboard I can do 90% of my work while on the road. 3. With a flash card I take my office files, music, and literature with me. 4. It's metal and durable. 5. It's great looking. (I know this shouldn't matter but it does)6. It has never quit or burped. It's been dependable right from the time I took it out of the box.Things I wish were better: 1. I wish the screen was active matrix because of the outdoor visibility issue. 2. I wish the processor was faster.Would I switch to a Palm or another Pocket PC maker because of these? No way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Everything You Want", "unixReviewTime": 988243200, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2001"}
