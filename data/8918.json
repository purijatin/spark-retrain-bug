It seems more elegant and sofisticated, while iPaq seems more like a very expensive novelty toyThe Jornada's heavier weight gives safe feel on your hand, and the rubberized edges makes you feel confortable and in control. iPaq weight and expansion pack makes you feel that your device is going to end on your feetiPaq has a better display resolution? you must see both devices simultaneously and you'll notice no much difference. iPaq seems easier to view Outdoor but I don't have problems with my Jornada if I change the display brightness to Outdoor by holding one button and select &quot;Outdoors&quot; in the HP SettingsWhat about the processor speed?. This is one of the best features of the iPaq. Jornada's 133Mhz processor sometimes its kind of slow, that considering I have multiple applications, an MP3 playing and trying to open a document in Word. Nothing to worry by the momentAnd finally, I got tired of waiting for Compaq to produce one simple iPaq available for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Why buy Jornada 458 instead iPaq ?", "unixReviewTime": 981504000, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2001"}
