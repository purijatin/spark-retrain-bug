While both are very impressive, they don't fill me needs.I want a small device that will allow me to keep my schedule, check contacts, keep a to-do list, and  jot an occasional note.  I don't need a box that tries to do everything, is  slow, and is clumsy to use. The interface really isn't conducive to editing  spreadsheets or documents. I don't have time to play with the media player,  and the thing is too big to slip in my pockcet.I really wanted to like  these devices, but I will stick with my trusty Palm.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It all depends on what you what......", "unixReviewTime": 958435200, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2000"}
