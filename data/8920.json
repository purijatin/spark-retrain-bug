With all  the different programs it comes with , its like having your home pc on your pocket. I couldn't ask for a better device for entertainment and information and with the c/flashcard port you can have lots of memory. It really is the best assistant you can have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best PDA", "unixReviewTime": 977011200, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2000"}
