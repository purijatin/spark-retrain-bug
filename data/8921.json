Never again would I buy a Pocket PC, even if the price were cut in half! This is one fairly useless peice of equipment in the scheme of things. MS Reader is a joke, as the version on the PPC is basically incompatible with the format of most books currently available beyond public domain books....and there is no fix in sight in the near term. Music? Even with USB expect long downloads and only acceptable quality..not a true music lover's delight. Some tape players sound better. As to business use...not worth the hype. Iffy and slow writing capabilities, with cumbersome calendar and contact list functionality. And battery life? Forget about it! I give this a 2 rating because I did find the storage of documents useful to a point, especially for editing speeches on the road. Otherwise, the hype doesn't tranlsate into reality. And movies..why would you on such a small screen? I have found the wireless web on my cellphone more versatile and useful -- get directions, restautrant recommendations and menus, news, games, AvantGo, newspaper and magazine articles, even poetry and ebooks in WAP format if I want them, with video coming soon. And it costs almost nothing, as well as being a heck of a lot easier! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on one of these things -- I am glad I tried,but even happier I got rid of it. I feel free again!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "After The WOW Factor Ends.................", "unixReviewTime": 978480000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2001"}
