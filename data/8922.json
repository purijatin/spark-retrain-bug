King", "helpful": [24, 25], "reviewtext": "Besides the fact that HP makes great products in general, this Jornada actually got me to migrate from a Palm V.  For all you Palm users, or any PDA for that matter, that is not an easy decision to make.  Not only do you have to think about the down time, learning curve and sheer hassle of migrating to a new platform, but you have to cross your fingers, say a prayer and hold on. But I am really happy to say that the Activesync software from MS works flawlessly...I don't think I can ever remember saying that about MS.  So that was a seamless process.  Compared to a Palm V, the HP Jornada wins hands down.  First, the color is exquisite...so sure, you sacrifice some battery life, BUT for everyday use, I rarely ever use these devices more than 8 hrs per stretch before its re-docked and re-synced...so it's a non-issue.  Second, the sheer flexibility and options it offers over a Palm V is dramatic.  For me, the most relevant ones are the ability to listen to audio books, MP3 files, and I'm soon to download my first e-book. (I am unlikely to use the voice recorder) Third, the comparatively huge memory 32 mb vs. a Palm V 2MB or 8MB is dramatic and powers the extra flexibility. I'm adding a 32MB flash card, and would prefer a 64 MB internal memory but that will come in time. One BIG PLUS the Pocket PC has overthe Palm is that it's great to read in low light situations such as a car, plane etc.  Have you ever tried to read a standard b/w Palm in low light? It's horrendous!Overall, this is a fantastic device.  Over the years, I've owned probably 4-5 different PDA's/organizers and I think the industry is finally figuring this product out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressed!
