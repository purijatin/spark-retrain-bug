The Jornada 548 does all that. Prices have dropped as the 560 series has been released, and I found a Targus foldable keyboard (another very satisfactory product)... The HP unit ships with an impressive library of ebooks on the installation CD, and there are lots of good games available from the Zdnet website and others. The final useful add-on is a combination USB cable made by iConcepts that also charges the PDA through the USB port -- giving easy access to synchronization and fast recharging at the same time with little to carry around. I have a cable on each of my computers at home and at work. The newest Active Sync software was a quick free download from the Microsoft website and it works fine with my XP-based computers. There's no need for a separate case because the removable hard cover protects it well and the stylus tucks into the cover. I'm sure the 560 series is faster, but this does the job for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works for me.", "unixReviewTime": 1015027200, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2002"}
