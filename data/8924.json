Of course I still keep it as a relic 'cause its card reader is out-of-order. It's kind of a long-time friend for me. So I recently decided to purchas HP67's prodigious grandson: Jornada 548. A very well designed and full of features pocket PC. Excellent style, handsome facia, rich in useful details. It fits perfectly in your pocket and hand. Handwriting recognition is good with HP included software and excellent with Microsoft (free-downloadable) Transcriber -I strongly recommend it. Synchronizing with Outlook is, after a minor avoidable bug, easy, fast and reliable. One more recommendation: if you plan to use it as a portable mp3 player, add a couple of bucks to your purchase and include at least 32 MB of compact flash memory. You won't be wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful gear!!!", "unixReviewTime": 993513600, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2001"}
