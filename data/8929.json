I have struggled with the choice of the sleekness of the Ipaq, the sturdiness of the Jornada or the hybrid Casio.  I realize that all of these companies make budget models that either lack color or substitute serial for usb or lack a cradle or even cut the RAM in half.  These models didn&#8217;t interest me.  As the Pocket PC is Microsoft based I new whatever applications I put on them would be bloated compared to the palm so a large amount of memory and a USB cable seemed a must to me.I chose the Jornada 548.  The Jornada has the slowest processor of the big three, E-125,  IPAQ 3650 and Jornada 548.  It also has one of the lowest color depths.  For all these faults I still chose the unit.My reasons are pretty straightforward.  The Jornada is cheaper than the comparable Casio and cheaper then the comparable IPAQ.  The second reason was the display.  The IPAQ display was gorgeous but out of my price range.  The Casio display was supposed to be better but in my humble opinion it stunk.  This became especially clear when using the Microsoft Reader function were the Casio letters looked purple and fuzzy versus black and crisp on the IPAQ and Jornada.  Lastly I liked the case better.  The protective cover beats the Casio unit and the IPAQ requires an additional piece to use CF cards.  (Sold separately of course:)I have yet to see a real downside to the slower processor unless I am really multitasking.  The TFT display is great indoors but is inferior to the IPAQ indoors.  Overall a great unit that beat the competition for my needs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My Pick in the Pocket PC Arena", "unixReviewTime": 992908800, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2001"}
