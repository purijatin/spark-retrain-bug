It works great and appears well made and should last a long time, especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times. No issues with it being loose, weak, or ready to break. Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge. It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition, and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Good Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable", "unixReviewTime": 1386028800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2013"}
