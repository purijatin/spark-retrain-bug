Neat. It's my working companion (loaded with medicine texts).BEWARE: 1- CSTN screen means direct sunlight won't let you see anything. 2- You'll fill up your 32MB or RAM very soon (so many uses...) so be prepared to wish a 64MB compactflash card (don't worry about buying an extra jacket or adapter: it's there).NICE looking: Executive class looking. iPAQ looks like a toy, and seems very plastic to me. This one looks slim and chick.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Most bang for the buck", "unixReviewTime": 986601600, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2001"}
