I am a fairly computer-savvy person, but this handheld was difficult to use out of the box for me. The synchronization process failed numerous times initially. Then I downloaded the Windows XP update, but that was not a fix. I had to reset all factory defaults (i.e. wipe out all stored data &amp; pgms) and then re-synch with the XP software on my PC.I still have problems with  memory management but I think this is a part of the too-steep learning curve on the 548. In addition, the processor can be maddeningly slow for some tasks, like opening a low resolution (1 megapixel) photo file. This sluggishness is also apparent when multi-tasking (like reading mail while running MP3s in the background), often requiring a soft reboot (reset). The good things are the price, expandable storage (I have a 256 card for music and 1 for pics), sturdy build and excellent graphics. I'm not sorry I bought it, I just wish I had more time to learn its intricacies.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not for the faint-hearted.....", "unixReviewTime": 1017187200, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2002"}
