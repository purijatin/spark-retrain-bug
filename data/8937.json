My 4 year old (almost 5) is doing pretty well at it and having fun. I like that the game doesn't feel like it was made with cheapness being a high priority as I've bought some pretty cheap stuff lately. The pieces are rubbery and not cheap plastic. Overall 5 stars. I think this is good for 4-6 year olds.One comment though, I felt the instructions were not completely clear on some issues, but parents can decide what to do in those cases.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fun & educational", "unixReviewTime": 1317254400, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2011"}
