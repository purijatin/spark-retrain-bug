My daughter had no interest in math and I've watched her interest and math skills jump the past few weeks as she's played.  She has gone from counting by fingers (each one every time) to only some of them to no fingers at all.  This is really a miracle for her!  She is four--will be five next week--and it has been a great game for us!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Game!", "unixReviewTime": 1372464000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2013"}
