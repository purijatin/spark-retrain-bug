He loves it and asks to play all of the time.  The age range is 5+ but I'd recommend it for 4+.To play the game, you roll 3 dice which create an addition or subtraction expression.  The result is the number of spaces you move.  There are also &#34;evens&#34; and &#34;odds&#34; spaces on the board.If you want math practice for your child in a fun way, this is one way to do it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A fun way to practice addition & subtraction", "unixReviewTime": 1387065600, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2013"}
