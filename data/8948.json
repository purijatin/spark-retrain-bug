I believe this game would only be useful for grades K-1(age4-6). The character pieces are: Green-snail, red-frog, blue-snake, and yellow turtle. The game reinforces addition and subtraction; odd and even numbers; and creating number sentences by having the child recognize which number is bigger to create a number sentence.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very cute math game", "unixReviewTime": 1382745600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2013"}
