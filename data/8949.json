We got it a week ago and he has asked to play it every day! It can be a really quick play, which is great. Depending on time you can do rematches. There is a lot of chance to fast forward or fall back, so each player might have several throws of the dice per turn. Nice size packaging. Narrow box to slide in next to other games in the big game closet. My 3 year old likes it too, but needs some help when the number get higher. Big brother of course loves to help out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Favorite quick game!", "unixReviewTime": 1384560000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2013"}
