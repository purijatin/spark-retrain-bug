This game is a great tool.  It only goes up to 6 on each dice so you can only go as far as 12 but still has really helped.  It is cute with 4 reptiles as token to move and has a couple of neat ways to play with shortcuts.  We like this purchase.  Just what we needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great fun for learning addition and subtraction.", "unixReviewTime": 1386201600, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2013"}
