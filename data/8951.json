Two dices have numbers on them, where as the third dice is the +,- operator. The child has to add or subtract numbers to make the right move.The game also teaches even/odd numbers.The endless loop in the game is hilarious. We always keep laughing on when can we get out of going around ducks!My son (4.5 years) loves the game, and we have noticed that he can now do maths mentally as well, without drawing lines on paper.Recommend whole-heartedly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My son loves it!
