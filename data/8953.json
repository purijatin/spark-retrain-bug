My six-year-old likes some variety when I teach her math concepts, and this game makes a nice change from the usual math enrichment books with pages of worksheets in them.The game comes with a game board, 4 little critter game pieces ( snail, frog, snake, and tortoise), 2 number dice, and 1 operations die.  The game is easy to play - once a game piece is chosen by each player, the piece is set on \"start\". The player who rolls the highest number gets to play first. All three dice are rolled and the player will have to form a math operation by placing the dice in a row,e.g. 4+1 (=5). Then the player will move his/her game piece the number of spaces, in this instance, 5 spaces. The player who gets to the Finish line first wins.The game is made interesting with the inclusion of special spaces such as \"evens\" or \"odds\"; a number space (if a player lands here, he/she will have to roll the operation die and move forwards for a plus, and backwards for a minus; short cut (a player that lands on this follows the arrow), and the endless loop feature.This kept my daughter and I both engaged for about 30-45 mins, and she wanted to play it again right after. I think she would get tired of it if we kept playing it over and over, but it makes for a nice change from the usual math worksheets. Also recommended is the money bags coin value game by Learning Resources.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great game to teach young children the concepts of addition and subtraction", "unixReviewTime": 1315440000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2011"}
