Easy to use, quick access to all my info.  I only wish the unit was a bit thinner, but that is my only complaint.  At first I was worried that 2 meg memory was not enough, silly me.  I have had the 2 meg unit for 6 months and it is literally crammed with info and I have only used 40% of the memory.  I even have loaded a few games and other software toys.  Battery life is great too.  I access my Visor dozens of times daily and the 2 AAA batteries last 3 to 4 weeks!!  If you want to work, buy this unit.  But if you want to play sound, record, have color (which sucks batteries), play games, then spend alot more money on a CE unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For those who want to work, not play", "unixReviewTime": 977961600, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2000"}
