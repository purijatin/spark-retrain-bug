They are not deal breakers, but for some users it may make a difference.1. Does not work on Win 95, NT without the serial cable ($) -- this is also true from MacOS 8.0 or below2. No faceplate included. Screen scratches are very apparent within weeks unless you buy a case. There are multiple reviews that describe broken glass and its overly fragile screen.3. The handsprings seem to use batteries at a much faster rate that Palms. I'm not sure why.4. Stylus is remarkably cheap and less usable. It makes a bizarre scraping noise.5. 2MG is fine at first. But if you are at all interested in going beyond the basic calender, address books, note pad functions, then get the models with the extra memory. Vindigo (free Zagat restaurant and updated movie listings) and AvantGo (free newspapers and magazines in electronic formats) will use the space and take your palm experience to a whole new level. If you live in a major city, Vindigo alone makes it worth owning a Palm.6. The 'expandability' doesn't seem to be worth much right now amd bys the time it is, I'm sure you'll have moved onto another model. I've poked around other reviews and have yet to find anyone who has gotten much value or use of additional modules.Net net. With the current Palm discount I would seriously consider the IIIxe for users that a) want a more durable and usable unit, b) want the extra memory at a relatively low cost. If you have to buy an adaptor (see reason 1), they end up costing the same. Either way, enjoy your PDA.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A few things to consider vs. Palm IIIxe", "unixReviewTime": 976320000, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2000"}
