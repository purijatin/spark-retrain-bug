I've NEVER been organized in my life, but the Visor is making it fun. My wife and I were getting busier and busier and I really felt like I was losing touch with our plans. The Visor has helped a lot. There's lots of great programs available and I've had fun learning how to program for the Palm OS.I have a memo where I've recorded the business hours of all the stores we frequent. So now when we're out, we know when a favorite store closes before driving across town and being disappointed. I have several nice solitaire games and a Bible program (NIV), so I always have something to keep me busy when I have my Visor (like this morning in the doctor's office!).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this thing!", "unixReviewTime": 969580800, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2000"}
