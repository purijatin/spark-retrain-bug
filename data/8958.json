It has the card-slot (springboard), which is a little limited in what has actually come out for it, but it's a good design.The deluxe model has 8MB, and this was a good price for an 8mb palm-pilot with an upgrade slot, plus, cool colors.With the non-deluxe model, this is dropped to 2MB.  It's only purpose in life was to be a cheaper replacement for the Palm III and earlier.Then I realized the problem.  The O/S is in ROM, not FLASH.  The O/S on these are Palm v3.1, which is about a year old.  THERE IS NO UPGRADE PATH TO PALM O/S 3.5!  To upgrade, you have to buy a whole new one.Even if you could, you'd have to wait for handspring's version.I recommend the Palm-IIIxe, it's the same thing, minus the springboard module (only REALLY useful for a few things, which are easily worked around).  Palm 3xe has 8mb, and FLASH ROM, plus it comes with Palm O/S 3.5 and is upgradable.  If you NEED the cellphone or wireless option, there are sleeves that fit over the pilot that do this.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "O/S Not Upgradable", "unixReviewTime": 981590400, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2001"}
