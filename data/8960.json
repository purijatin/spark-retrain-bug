I currently use a Pocket PC (replaced my daytimer) and an HP 690 (when I need to compose letters or lengthy e-mail on the move).  However, with these devices comes  an inherent level of complexity (especially when synching multiple devices)  with the actual OS and applications.My wife wanted a handheld device to  essentially act as a daytimer.  Rather than forcing her into the MS  Operating system, and risking the possibility that she may not like the  complexity, I managed to convince her that the Palm OS was a better route  (simplicity).  Ultimately we chose the Visor Deluxe.Installation was  incredibly simple.  The instructions are easy and to the point.  Whats  more, she took to the device immediately.  In fact, she will not put it  down.So, if you are shopping for a gift for someone who may not  appreciate the inherent hazards of Win CE devices, go with the Visor.  Its  the best value for your dollar (the 8mb Version).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great way to avoid Win CE Devices", "unixReviewTime": 963964800, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2000"}
