A great little tool to help one keep organized.  I've enjoyed using it, even though it causes others to snicker, due to the &quot;geek&quot; factor in using a PDA, rather than a paper organizer.  There are also a number of wonderful add-on software programs available.  The only negative has been due to my desire to use it with both a serial connection to a Mac and a USB connection to a Windows machine.  If you are using one platform, I don't think you should have any problems.  Wish list - I wish it came with a hard copy manual, the CD-ROM based manual was not very easy to use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cool Tool", "unixReviewTime": 974592000, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2000"}
