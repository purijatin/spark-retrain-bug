Burgess", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "After being on the waiting list at Amazon for 2 months and also shopping  elsewhere for the 3Com Palm IIIe, I was plain old fed up! I wasn't willing  to spend the extravagant prices for the higher end Palm Pilots (which seem  to be the only ones 3Com will produce in abundance!). I ran across the  Handspring Visor at Amazon and decided to take a chance. I LOVE IT! After  comparing it to a friends Palm III, I don't see a difference worth  mentioning here. It is fully compatible with the Palm so why wait! The only  small pieve I have is you have to shop at Amazon or Handspring for  accessories and/or replacement parts!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Why wait for 3Com", "unixReviewTime": 966038400, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2000"}
