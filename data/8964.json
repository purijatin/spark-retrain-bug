However, now I can't imagine functioning without it. I use it for everything from business documents, to taking pictures, to organzing my wardrobe! The best part is that there are thousands of websites you can go to get free downloads!Right now I am investing in the other modules and so far I have had no problems. I was never a computer 'geek', but now I spend hours on the computer looking for updates and ways to make it even niftier. If you own one and you are looking for fun stuff, try 'ActiveSky Media' -it's cool because now I can even watch short films on my palm! (Because of the picture quality, cartoons are the best bet).I made a mistake syncing once and lost ALL of my information so I have ordered the backup module, but even with that, I am still impressed. Besides, now I figured out how to retrieve 'archived data'. It's definitely worth every penny and more!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Work and Play-all in one", "unixReviewTime": 999302400, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2001"}
