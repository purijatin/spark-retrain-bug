More features than a Palm for less money! The Springboard (expansion) slot is what sold me On the Handspring line. I currently have a MemPlug module in my Visor (the Smartmedia version) and a 64MB Smartmedia card for a total of 72MB on my Handspring! The Springboard possibilities are almost endless! ECG units, TEMS units, pager modules, phone mudules, e-books, the list goes on and on. This unit has half the processor power of some of the other units in the Handspring line, but it's still a rocket! The amount of software available for download (since it runs the exact same OS as the Palm units, you can use the same software!) is unbelievable! It's cheap, very useful, and a lot of fun.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Buy one now!", "unixReviewTime": 1005004800, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2001"}
