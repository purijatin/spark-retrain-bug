The Handspring Visor has all of the benefits of the Palm OS (compatibility with the other millions of Palm devices and the 70,000+  developers for the Palm OS), but it out-Palms Palm.  The Visor Deluxe has  more memory for less money.  It's better designed (it clips into a case  rather than using Velcro; the styli are far superior to Palm's) and  provides for almost unlimited upgradeability through the Springboard  modules, which are slowly starting to come to market.Admittedly, the  Visor Deluxe's lack of Flash-ROM means you cannot upgrade the OS without a  Springboard module.  That is a possible drawback, but the addition of  better products in the ROM (Datebook+ and City Time) and USB support  (plug-and-play, and speed are key) more than compensate for now.  As for  the lack of lithium ion batteries, the ability to use regular AAA, rather  than having to have an adapter like the Palm V series, and the new AAA NiMH  batteries are actually more versatile and much more user-friendly.I was  reluctant to get a PDA for a long time, thinking it was just a  super-charged Day Runner.  Without the Visor, I still wouldn't have one.  I'm thrilled I do, though, for I use it constantly in ways I never would  have imagined.  If you're seriously considering a PDA based on the Palm OS,  the Visor Deluxe is the way to go.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply the best PDA available until the next Handpsring PDA", "unixReviewTime": 963014400, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2000"}
