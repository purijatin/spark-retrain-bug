For something merely pocket sized you get a memopad, to-do list, datebook, contact book, and the ability to do so much more!I find myself using this thing to remember key appointments in my life.  Also when I'm bored somewhere, I fire up one of the games I've downloaded, or using AvantGo (downloaded program) to check on the news lately.The downside is occasionally the USB hotsync doesn't work right, requiring you to try a sync again.  Once in a great while having to reboot your computer to get it to work.  However this happens few and far between (maybe 1 in 20 hotsyncs).  However hotsyncs are so easy, just push a button and voila you're synced up with Outlook!In short, anybody who's got a life they consider complex should consider getting one of these.  You won't regret it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A savior for the disorganized...", "unixReviewTime": 973382400, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2000"}
