My blue Visor Deluxe is a great tool that has all the basic software I need bundled with it. It synchronizes  faultlessly with Microsoft Outlook on my PC and is great to use.However,  the synchronization software on my Windows 98 laptop seems to be stopping  it from going into suspend mode. I tried getting e-mail support for this  problem from Handspring and they were no help at all. It looks like they  don't have time to read the e-mail you send, but just reply with a canned  response that does not address the issue. I'm living with that  problem.The Visor (Palm OS) software has only failed on me once: when I  turned it on I got a dialog box saying the system was corrupt. It then went  into a loop rebooting itself but never actually restarting. I had to do a  hard reset (losing ALL my data) to get it to work again. I have no idea why  that happened and it has not happened again. Fortunately I had it backed up  to a Springboard backup module and did not lose anything permanently.I  find the Graffiti handwriting input quite easy to use - although I am still  faster picking at the soft keyboard on the screen.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "All I expected", "unixReviewTime": 963619200, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2000"}
