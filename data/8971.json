Well I should say it is 1 1/2 years since I received my first Visor.  I am on my 4th.  It is a joy to use.  Easy to input data, Grafiti is easy to use, the layout is simple, the included software is intuitive to use and the USB connection is so simple to set up even I could do it.BUT.....  The first one the case cracked along the back after about one month, the second one the screen went bad after three weeks, the third one the case cracked and now I am on the 4th, and it has a cracked case.  I am not at all rough on the unit.  I keep it in a case, place it in my desk draw at work and keep it out of harms way in general.  I have never dropped one.  The three with cracks all developed cracks in different places.Handsprings customer service has been fantastic and they have happily sent replacement units each time.  But one must consider the durability of something that is designed to set in the palm of your hand.If I do by another PDA soon, I will purchse one with a metal case, like the Plam Vx or the Visor Edge.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A joy to use but a bit delicate for the task at hand", "unixReviewTime": 989020800, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2001"}
