The basic Pocket Mirror software sync's up your Inbox, Outbox, Deleted, Draft, and Filed (didn't investigate Filed yet). Unless you keep all the mail you need in your Inbox folder you will be disappointed. The upgrade to Pocket Mirror promises more, and- who knows?- maybe the Filed folder on the basic version holds the answer.I will say that the unit is a bit slow at times, which probably also explains the difficulty in convincing alarms to stop. I've found that moving the stylus over a broad area of the screen button seems to help, but often that only serves to get the application's attention, and you are still left to tap the button again to actually modify the alarm time.Speaking of alarms, the unit's tiny speaker is a bit weak, especially when compared to my mobile phone. A bigger, more powerful speaker and/or perhaps a larger speaker opening would work wonders. I have ALL alarms set to high and struggle to hear the alarm at times. I keep the unit clipped to my belt but facing me, though the unit sits 1/2&quot; to 1&quot; away from my body, and the speaker is NOT obstructed by the belt clipped storage unit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but not great", "unixReviewTime": 984960000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2001"}
