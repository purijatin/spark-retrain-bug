EXCELLENT choice for Mac users.  USB cradle recoginzed immediately.  Software (Palm Desktop) is not the most eye catching but it does the job.  Paid [amt] or about [amt] more than an Palm m100.  For that I got 8MB of RAM, USB Docking cradle and all the expansion of the springboard.  I have had no problem downloading lots of free software - even stuff that was supposed to be Win 9x only.  If you are a first time buyer/user of a PDA I recomend the Visor Deluxe.
