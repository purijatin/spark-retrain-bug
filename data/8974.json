I have tried to be an organized person, but nothing ever seemed to work, until I bought my Handspring.  I complete a lot more tasks b/c I don't forget them!  Everything is stored in one place so I never lose information.  It has come in handy for addresses many times in the short time I have had it.I've only owned it for just over a month and already replaced the batteries, but only b/c I use it for hours everyday.  One great thing about it is that it makes me look busy even though I may just be playing a game. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best money I ever spent...", "unixReviewTime": 970185600, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2000"}
