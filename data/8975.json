I have already started to add software. I have one small caveat, more of an advisory. If you use Yahoo! for online storage of your calendar, address book, etc. and use Intellisync for Yahoo! to synchronize your online info and your Visor, you may not be able to use the proprietary software that comes with the Visor. I had a Rex 6000 and could use both its software and Yahoo's. But that is apparently not the case with the Visor. This is not a major drawback for me but if you use and like Yahoo!, you should keep it in mind.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1008374400, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2001"}
