The Handspring has proven to be the superior choice. The USB makes backups considerably faster, the screen quality is far better, and the stylus with built-in reset pin and Phillips screwdriver is essential. The blue nicely matches my G3 at work, too, though my PowerBook would go better with graphite.My PDA is essential to me, both professionally and personally, and I'm very pleased with the Visor Deluxe. My only complaint is that it was very difficult to switch my data from the Palm to the Visor, and I had backup difficulties initially that required me to move my backup folder out of my user folder on my computer. It now works fine, but it was pretty frustrating at the time. However, the Handspring tech support proved to be fairly fast and helpful, which was a nice surprise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than the Palm...", "unixReviewTime": 974332800, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2000"}
