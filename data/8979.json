It's the perfect starter PDA, and has all of the PALM functions people have come to know and love -- addresses, to-do lists, downloadable features like New York Times front page, CNN and Sports Illustrated. I've even put a free map of my county on my PDA from Mapopolis.com (a must if you haven't tried it! Streets are searchable). Also, make sure you add Vindigo, a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviews.The Handspring also has the best features for the money. It has a bigger screen than the m105 (which I returned after a week), expandability (which I have yet to use, although I long for the GPS attachment from Magellan -- maybe when it  drops to $... on clearance?)That said, I only give the Visor Deluxe four stars because it does have some significant shortcomings.One is bulk. It's significantly larger than the Palm V, which is $... more, and also requires new batteries after about  two weeks of relatively heavy usage. It still fits in my chest pocket, though. The Palm V has a lithium rechargeable, and the new Palm 500 has an even better battery, but why pay $... for what is still basically, at heart, an appointment calendar?BTW, I am a newspaper reporter who previously had four Rolodexes on my desk. No longer. No longer do I misplace names, numbers, or dates.
