For the same price as a Palm  IIIxe you get all its functionality, AND MORE! Handspring has that  additional slot for adding springboard modules. What is a springboard  module you ask? Basically anything you want it to be. Currently you can  attach a modem, extra memory, an IR emitter which makes your handspring  into a universal remote and a small module to designed to make the  handspring act like a wirless device (like the Palm VII. That's right, you  pay for a palm IIIxe but can effectively get the functionality of a palm  VII among a whole bunch of other things. The only thing that I know I will  proably regret is having bought this device too soon. I am sure in a years  time, one will be able to purchase a color handspring, and that too at the  same cost if not lower. Oh and let praise amazon too, for their extreme  fast shipping of the handsrping. and the fact they have not abuse their  position as exclusive online retailer of handsrping stuff.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A redundant fragment of praise!", "unixReviewTime": 964828800, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2000"}
