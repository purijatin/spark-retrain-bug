First and foremost is the calendar. No more bulky day planner! Instead, I can pull it out of my front pocket any time I want. I also like the fact that all of the information is on my computer at home and online (using Yahoo! TrueSync software). I also use the to-do list all the time, as well as using my Visor to take notes in class, write emails, play games, and read the news, weather, and even check out local movie listings using AvantGo software. There are thousands of free software applications out there for almost anything you could imagine. The Graffiti text input system is easy to use - I now write just as fast into my Visor as on paper with a pen.I have excellent backup software (BackUpBuddy) and inexpensive insurance from PDAs Lost Or Stolen so I don't worry about what will happen if my Visor gets stolen, is lost, or broken.If you can't tell already, I LOVE my Visor Deluxe. It helps me to stay organized and on top of things (no small feat). While the design is a bit bulkier than a Visor Edge or a Palm Vx, it is very sturdy, and for the price, I don't think it can be beat. I haven't purchased any accessories for my visor, but I know people who have purchased keyboards and springboard expansion modules, including modems and memory expansions, and they love them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This will change the way you do everything!", "unixReviewTime": 994032000, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2001"}
