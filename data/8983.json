Its mix of features and functions can immediately replace any day planner you  carry.The Visor Deluxe is a solidly built product. Its 8MB of RAM will  hold all your contacts, your calendar for at least months at a time, dozens  of memos, and other programs and information, all with plenty of room to  spare.Initially released with a chintzy plastic stylus that easily  scratched the Visor's screen, Handspring wisely switched to a heavier  metal-body stylus with a plastic tip that's much easier on the screen, even  under heavy use.The Springboard slot means amazing expandability,  including the ability to back up or restore all data in a single  operation.Simple to set up and use, with a good mix of applications  included, the Visor Deluxe makes a great way to get your feet wet in the  PDA market. If you already own another PDA and are thinking of trying  something different, take a good look at the Visor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great start in the PDA market", "unixReviewTime": 960681600, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2000"}
