It is a sturdy, solid device that is still going fine (none the worse for wear) after 2 years of heavy duty usage.I love the stylus, and would like to see many others like it, it's heavy (metal body) and it includes a reset pin (on the pointy side) and a wonderful screwdriver (on the top side) that exactly fits the screws in the case, temptation to mess with the warranty if there ever was one.The only down side to it is that since Handspring has decided to exit the PDA market and concentrate on the Communicator market, so we wont see any more excelent products like this one.  The Ingenious (sp?) springboard modules are also dead and there won't likely be any more innovatin on that side.The current price is very nice, so if you want a ... rugged pda, buy it.  If you want something more state-of-the-art and with more future, go for the Zire 71 or an entry level Sony.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excelent PDA well worth the price, although...", "unixReviewTime": 1052179200, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2003"}
