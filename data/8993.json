My decision to buy it was mainly due to the following reasons:  1) Its price. It was the cheapest selling PDA where I found enough memory 8MB for most of my needs.  2) The fact that it had a USB cradle. Equivalent Palm PDAs came with a Serial cradle, which take forever to synchronize, the USB cradle being optional (for additional [money]).  3) Yes... I have to admit thatI thought it looked cool! ;)However I became majorly dissapointed when I realized two things: the Palm OS crashed at least 4 times on me over the course of only two months. With Windows CE, I never saw this happen.Second and most important, there is NO sychronizing application (neither the one that comes with the Visor, nor any other third party solution) that does a very simple thing: allow what I like to call a differential sychronization. What this is, is the ability to synchronize ONLY those events, or contacts, or e-mails, etc. that have changed or are new. With any software for synchronizing your Visio (or any Palm, as a matter of fact) to your Outlook, or any other e-mail/contacts/calendar/etc. program you use, you have to wait until ALL the items you have in both sides synchronize, as if it were the very first time you're doing it.As you may realize this is very ineffective, specially if you're on the run, or have too many items to synchronize.This is mainly why I recently sold it, and I am on my way back to getting a Pocket PC (formerly known as Windows CE) PDA. Only reco about Pocket PCs: stay away from Casio...I will try to drop a word or two about this in a review about their Cassiopeia E-100.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very good, but...
