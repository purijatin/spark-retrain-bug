Even with lots of memory hog apps like avantgo, epocrates, quickoffice, there is plenty of memory left. The screen is much easier to read (important for the 40+ crowd) and so far the performance has been flawless, even with lots of 3rd party applications, hacks, etc. loaded on it. This includes dropping the unit from 4 feet onto a concrete sidewalk with only a nick in the corner of the case. I had been concerned a bit about the lack of flash memory and the inability to upgrade the OS, but the differences between the Palm OS 3.5 on my last PDA and the older version on this one is negligible.I can't imagine future upgrades will be that significant. One more thing...because this is discontinued, some of the peripherals might be cheaper too...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great buy for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1014508800, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2002"}
