Fopiano", "helpful": [27, 28], "reviewtext": "I ordered the Handspring Visor in October 1999, and received it the first part of December. I have not had a day since then that I wasn't totally appreciative! This is a great value at $249, even without the springboard  modules, compared to the Palm Computing brand.  The springboard modules add  a flexibility and versatility that no one else has.  As a CPA, I keep all  my client contacts in Outlook, which works just perfectly for me.  All I do  is hot-sync once or twice a day, and I have my entire client database,  including appointments, with me at all times.  I use a tiny Excel-like  spreadsheet program to do what-if calculations. Since only a few rows and  columns are visible, I limit my input and results fields to that visible  area. (You can design your spreadsheets on your PC, and download to Visor.)  Since the Visor was designed by the original founders of Palm Computing,  the cutting-edge design and features are no surprise. I can't say enough  about the Visor, and am looking forward to utilizing the springboard  modules in the future (maybe a wireless communicator, or a full-featured  tax program?). Since it uses the Palm OS, the number of programs available  is mind-boggling.  Two thumbs up for the Handspring Visor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Last PDA you'll buy for a few years...", "unixReviewTime": 960768000, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2000"}
