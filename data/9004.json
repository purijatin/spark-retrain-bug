Stidham", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "All I can say is that this one piece of hardware will save your sanity should you ever need to perform a hard reset.  I had to, once, and was so happy to have this thing.  Hotsynching, alone, does not necessarily back up everything from your PDA.  Restoring from your last Hotsynch doesn't necessarily replace all of your data.  This module gives you 100% peace of mind by providing 100% back up and restore capabilities.  If you don't have a PC/Mac to hotsynch with, then this is the only way to go.  Trust me when I say this, the first time you have to perform a hard reset and you slip this module into your Visor and opt for restore you'll be grateful.  Get it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One oopsie and this will save your life!", "unixReviewTime": 985132800, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2001"}
