I keep &quot;traditional&quot; Palm information such as names and appointments, but I also keep books, reference materials, and databases.  If I'm around my computer, I HotSync several times a day.  Recently, though, I had to go on a business trip for a couple of months and would not have the ability to HotSync.  I figured ... for some piece of mind was a good investment.The backup process couldn't be easier.  You pop the Springboard module into its bay, the Visor turns on and the Backup application appears.  Tapping the backup button starts the backup operation, which lasts a couple of minutes.  After that, you remove the module and store it in a safe place.I have actually used both the backup and restore features.  I was very impressed by the ability to restore every aspect of the Visor, from its ID, to its preferences.  All the applications and data were copied exactly, which saved me considerable frustration after having to perform a hard-reset.If you're constantly synching with your computer, you don't need the Backup module.  If you are often away from your computer or if you use your Visor as a standalone PDA, the Backup module is not only crucial.  This feature alone makes the Visor a worthwhile investment over a Palm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The ideal Visor travel companion", "unixReviewTime": 973209600, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2000"}
