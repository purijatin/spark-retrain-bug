I always worried about travelling with my PDA cause I couldn't &quot;hot sync&quot; with my PC and was worried about loosing collected data.  This module removes those fears completely.  I recently went to Switzerland and my Visor hung up on me and I had to do a Hard Reset.  But check it...popped in the Backup Mod and WHAM....back to normal in a few minutes...something a Palm can't offer.  This device truly redefines PDA mobility and provides a greater sense of redundancy.  Just make sure you keep your eye the Backup Mod.  If someone grabbed it they could restore all your data to their own device...my advice is to get &quot;LockMe&quot; to secure your PDA so when its restored a password is required.A must have module for people who really do use &amp; store data in their Visor and don't just use it as a conversation piece.Kev", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Travel away from your PC Worry Free...Amazing.", "unixReviewTime": 975888000, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2000"}
