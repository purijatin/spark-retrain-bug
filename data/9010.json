The only reason I only gave this module four stars instead of five is that its only for disaster recovery, not for backing up or restoring individual files. As long as you know this going in, you won't be disappointed. If you want a module that lets you backup and restore individual files, as well as add an unlimited amount of RAM to your Visor, get a PiTech MemPlug. The MemPlug lets you use either CompactFlash or SmartMedia cards (they have two models, one for each format) as if they were part of your hand held's own memory. Get a MemPlug and make a Palm user green with envy!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy and quick, but all or nothing.", "unixReviewTime": 996796800, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2001"}
