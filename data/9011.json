Just buy it already and give yourself some peace of mind.Here's my testimonial: I bought the backup module nearly a year ago and never had to use its restore function.  I would just back up every week or so and go about my business.  Then I cracked the screen on my Visor somehow and couldn't use the stylus for any data entry.  Handspring sent me a replacement Visor (for $85 and they shipped it the next day) and I simply plugged in the backup module and I was back on track without missing a beat. I keep a ton of applications (Pocket Quicken, Dietlog, Fitsync, Noah Lite Dictionary, Avantgo, Vindigo, etc.) on my Visor and thankfully I didn't have to reinstall any of the software.The convenience of the backup module means I will probably remain loyal to Handspring for the duration, especially if I ever upgrade from my Visor Deluxe to the Edge or Prism.  Transferring all of my stuff from one Visor to another was simply a breeze with this backup module.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must have for any Visor owner", "unixReviewTime": 989712000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2001"}
