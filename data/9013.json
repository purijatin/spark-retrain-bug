Baker \"...Steve\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "While the Visor is a stable product, it is possible to completely confuse it and end up losing all of your data.I did it while trying to wirelessly synchronize with Omnisky and I ended up losing all of my data by doing a hard reser (starts your Visor over from scratch).The first time, it was quite a blow because I had to reinstall everything. The next day I ordered this product and when it arrived I immediately made a backup.I am thinking about getting two of these items, one for a baseline backup of my system and one for my everyday backup of essential information.It is quick and easy, when you insert it into the slot the Visor loads the program and prompts you for action. You simply click on the icon that identifies backup or restore and it does the rest. When it is done you can remove the module and everything is back to normal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Essential accessory", "unixReviewTime": 996710400, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2001"}
