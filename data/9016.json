I've been taking high resolution pictures with my Prism and my friends are amazed of this gadget.  Also, the eyecontact software makes this camera simple awesome.  However, white light or daylight is a must.  If someone would asked me, which module to buy, I would shout &quot;Get the EyeModule 2&quot; since it is much much much... better than the original Eyemodule.  Why would you miss the fun?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The most fun module ever", "unixReviewTime": 984009600, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2001"}
