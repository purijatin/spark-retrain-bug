The eyemodule is so small you can take it with you everywhere and take some photos you would otherwise miss.  My 2-1/2 year old daughter loves it because she can see the pictures right  away on the Visor screen. I print them out 6 or 8 to an 8.5x11 page and  they look fine at that size. It's really a fun challenge to try to create a  good photograph with that few pixels. I'm planning to create an online  gallery of images soon. The time-lapse feature is a lot of fun - set it up  and the camera will capture images at intervals you have set. Snapped into  the Visor, it doesn't look like a camera, so you can take candid shots and  no one even knows you are taking photos. Color images are about 190 KBytes  each, so you will want the 8 MB version of the Visor. I can imagine real  estate agents, insurance adjusters, salespeople, househunters, and anyone  with kids will enjoy this cool little camera. My other digital camera is a  Kodak DC260 with 1536x1024 resolution. The eyemodule is clearly no  competition for it, but they both have a place and a purpose. The eyemodule  is a fraction of the price, much smaller in size, and can grab a shot  within a second of turning it on. Think of the eyemodule as a very small,  more flexible digital alternative to Polaroids and you won't be  disappointed. At over $1 a shot for Polaroids, the eyemodule will quickly  pay for itself too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Think of it as a digital &quot;Polaroid&quot; with free film!", "unixReviewTime": 963100800, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2000"}
