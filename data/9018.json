And it was one of the first modules I purchased.The reviews you read of high grain and low resolution of this classic eyemodule are true as are the high coolness and fun factor.All in all this module is worth its price for two reasons:1) The 320x240 gray scale mode is seems sharper than the color mode (I guess it is not as sensitive to subtile lighting).  For a quick snapshot in a meeting, this works well.2) The optional software allows you to put thumbnails into an addressbook (eyecontact software has to be downloaded from their website).  It's almost worth the price alone to have a little photo of someone next to their address book info.Don't expect archival images -- but be ready for a lot of fun.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Visor Fun from IDEO", "unixReviewTime": 996624000, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2001"}
