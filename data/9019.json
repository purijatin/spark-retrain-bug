I took a load of test pictures in Seattle over the weekend, but was not able to review them because the PC software that came  with the unit would not install on my PC. I kept on getting &quot;Conduit  not found&quot; errors part way through the install process.I was  finally able to get through to eyemodule technical support this evening and  the support person had me uninstall all the Palm Desktop software from my  PC and soft reset the Visor. After I reinstalled everything, the conduit  worked and I was able to view my pictures on my PC.My, what a  disappointment! Even photos taken a few feet away were dark and indistinct  unless the subject was in bright sun. Now I know the camera's limitations I  can use it effectively: get as close as you can to subjects in bright light  - then you'll get photos just about good enough to e-mail.The eyemodule  is great for candid photogbraphy - no one thinks you're taking a snapshot,  just fiddling with a handheld. If only the quality were better.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun toy, but...", "unixReviewTime": 963187200, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2000"}
