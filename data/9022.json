It amuses me endlessly.  I take it to otherwise boring meetings, and it just looks like I'm making notes on my Handspring, when I'm snapping quick and funny pix of people.  The camera is so small that nobody notices it.  I take it on the subway and get great \"a day in the life of a commuter\" pictures.  I use it to take pictures that the kids can include in school reports.  I enjoy it thorougly!  It is SO EASY to use!!!That said, the resolution isn't very good.  Forget taking pictures of people from beyond 10 feet -- 5 feet if you want to see facial expressions.  Forget taking pictures in rooms with uneven lighting.  Don't even think about printing the pictures, unless they are real close-ups.  It just doesn't capture that many pixels.  But -- keeping that in mind -- it's a great little camera.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's great for what it is, just don't expect photo-quality", "unixReviewTime": 1023840000, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2002"}
