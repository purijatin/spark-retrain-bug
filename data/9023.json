It was just so easy to leave the eyemodule in place instead of bothering with the real camera for quick shots.This is a quick way to note or document something. parked in a really big parking lot? Photograph the nearest location sign and landmark. Working on a project and need a visual reference? Photograph it.Stealth feature- it does not look like a camera! You can photo a LOT of things that a camera user cannot because of this! It also does not use a flash, so there is nothing to give you away.Downsides- decent or color pictures eat memory quickly. No flash, zoom, or similar features.Worth it, especially at under [dollar amount]!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does what it does nicely!", "unixReviewTime": 1006300800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2001"}
