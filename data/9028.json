They were shipped via USPS and arrived in 4 days. The shipping charge is included in the price. These batteries have a long life span. The price and the service from BDS is excellent. The cost of gasoline would be far higher than the BDS cost if I were to search for these batteries in a local store. Would not hesitate to make further purchases from this company.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good Service", "unixReviewTime": 1313280000, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2011"}
