Since batteries are pretty much all the same.  I liked this product because in a singe package it contains to two CR-2 lithium Photo Batteries.  Since I  bought my Minolta SLR camera from Amazon.com, which require two batteries,  this would be a better, and cheaper choice.  Plus it's great for the  Environment too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Two Batteries in a package a GREAT idea!", "unixReviewTime": 961113600, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2000"}
