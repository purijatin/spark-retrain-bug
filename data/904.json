It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Great", "unixReviewTime": 1367798400, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2013"}
