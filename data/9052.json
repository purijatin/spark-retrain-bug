I ordered from Best Deal Supply and the battery was not only different from what was pictured (it was a different Energizer CRV3) it was loose in a paper bag so I had no way to check the expiration on the battery.  When I put it in the camera it seemed like it barely had enough juice to turn the camera on.  This continues to be a problem, so I am guessing they sent a very expired battery.  I have used the Emergizer Lithium Photo (silver and blue one) before, from other sellers, and they worked great, but the one's being sold by Best Deal Supply are not a best deal, so just be careful which company is filling your order and you will probably be fine.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Be careful who you order from", "unixReviewTime": 1363392000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2013"}
