I needed this type of battery for a camera that was packed for nearly ten years and still had film in it.  So naturally I was curious what was on the film.  Before looking on Amazon I check local stores and the cheapest I found them for was ten dollars.  In my opinion that's a lot to pay for two batteries.  So I purchased them from Amazon at a very reasonable price.  I didn't pay for shipping, which was a plus and the batteries arrived early.  I love shopping at Amazon because I usually find what I'm looking for at a lower cost.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great price", "unixReviewTime": 1372809600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2013"}
