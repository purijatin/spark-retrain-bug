Senior", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewtext": ".I bought one of these for my girlfriend to use with her Xmas present--a Visor Platinum.  The combination is outstanding.The Visor is a little too fat to slide in a pocket like my Palm 3xe, but for a woman with a purse, or a man with a suit pocket, this is ideal.It is sharp looking, and has room for a few business or credit cards.  The Platinum is a gorgeous PDA.  This leather case make it look even sharper and more professional.The leather pouch that comes with the Platinum provides good protection, but doesn't cut it for everyday use.This fold-out leather case is the one to get.Conrad B.
