Their design of the Visor and its cases is truly superb.The bifold case is padded enough to keep your visor safe from the  occasional light drop, and let's face it, gravity will eventually exert its  effects, no matter how careful you are.  The case also contains a small  pad, which is ideal for giving a small note to a non-Palm associate.  PDAs  are great, but they don't print--yet.Perhaps the best selling point,  though, is it's size.  It's large enough for the pad, some business cards,  ID cards, credit card-sized cards, etc, and large enough so you don't lose  it by forgetting it (I've seen people forget smaller devices).  It's not  too large, though, to tote around all day or pack quickly.  In fact, it  even fits comfortably in my chinos.I've seen a number of Visor cases,  and while others certainly have merit, this is by far my favorite  &quot;everyday&quot; case.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A perfect combination of protection, function, and size", "unixReviewTime": 963014400, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2000"}
