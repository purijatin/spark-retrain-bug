The only drawback with this method is that it does not work with my &quot;eyemodule&quot; digital camera attached because the camera lens is over the top of the unit  where the leather case's clip fits.Even with no papers in the case's  pockets, it feels a little tight around my Visor. I'd recommend a few  millimetres more space to be really confortable. The new leather smalls  classy though.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A little tight, but the leather smells good", "unixReviewTime": 963187200, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2000"}
