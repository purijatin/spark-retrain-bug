I like how the Visor just clips into it and doesn't require any Velco tape. The slots for credit cards, business cards, and money are very handy. The case isn't much larger than the Visor itself and is thin enough to fit into a back pocket, but you need to remember not to sit on it! If you're ever worried about the screen, you can insert the Visor in backwards and get extra protection from the plastic back (they've basically sewn the plastic cover that comes with the Visor into the case). The construction is very nice. My only major wish is that the Visor was completely sealed by the case. Three sides remain mostly exposed to the elements, so this case can't even be considered weather resistant.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A nice, dedicated case for the Handspring Visor.", "unixReviewTime": 969667200, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2000"}
