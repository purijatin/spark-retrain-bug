But what works best for me is that I use it as a wallet.  I used to have a big fat trifold wallet, but using this has forced me to dump all the extra stuff I was carrying around.  Now I have my PDA and my credit cards, ID's and cash, all in one easy location.  Sure it might be nice to have a thinner package, but I would need a thinner PDA first.  When you come across one that is a better deal than the current price on the visor let me know.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Wallet Replacement", "unixReviewTime": 1009065600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2001"}
