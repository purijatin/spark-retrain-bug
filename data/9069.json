Radi \"jradi\"", "helpful": [135, 138], "reviewtext": "One of my favorite perks about the Handspring is that they werebuilt w/ the thought of one day clipping into somesort of acase.All PDA's on the market today attach to day planners or cases w/ the use of a LOT of velcro. This is a sloppy solution and something I always dreaded doing to such an expensive device.Now comes handspring.  I don't know why they don't advertise this feature at all (you can't tell from the photos) but the case is designed such that it is &quot;clipped&quot; very securely into all sorts of accessories - No Velcro!  Love it!If you go to their website you'll see many, many more cases available (you'll want to stick to cases that were specifically designed for handspring or you're getting a velcro deal). I own 4 different case solutions (it comes w/ a plastic cover, or a fake leather slip cover).  Of them all this is my favorite general use case.I also recommend the hard plastic belt clip case because it protects the device when tossing it in a backpack, etc..( )- a cheap low tack adhesive covering for the screen called WriteRight - because once the screen is scratched, it's scratched.  This clear covering is replaceable when it gets too scratched (maybe bi-monthly) - and is pretty inexpensive.  Hopefully Amazon will start carrying more accesories - I prefer shopping here (faster delivery, cheaper shipping, and customer comments are always handy).
