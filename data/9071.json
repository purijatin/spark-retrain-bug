I'm running Windows ME, and noticed that the manufacture placed the drivers in the windows &quot;inf&quot; directory, not the system directory which is generally the default.  So, after manually pointing to the proper directory the product installed without fault.The product was recognized as a &quot;General Purpose USB Hub&quot; and created two new drive letters.  This allows tremendous versatility.  You can open and edit pictures directly on the &quot;smart media&quot; memory card or simply copy them to your local hard drive.Overall, I would recommend this product to friends, but gave it a 3 because the manufacture needs better support (i.e. FAQ pages) and automated installation.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Excellent product once installed.", "unixReviewTime": 983232000, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2001"}
