I have a Nikon Coolpix 950 and a SanDisk 128  MB Compact Flash card and discovered that serial port downloads of digital  photos from the camera to my PC were going to take FOREVER!  Since I had a  newer PC with a USB port and an operating system that claimed to have USB  support, I thought I'd give this a try (this was my first experiment into  uncharted USB waters).Let me tell you, it works great!  The software  installed easily into Windows 98, downloads are amazingly fast, and it  hasn't crashed my system yet.  True, you do have to remove your  CompactFlash card from your camera when you want to download pictures, but  that's easy.  The time you save will more than make up for the additional  step.  This purchase is a no-brainer - just get it and you won't be sorry.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Blows away serial transfers", "unixReviewTime": 969408000, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2000"}
