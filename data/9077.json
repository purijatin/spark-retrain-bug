The second reader would read some PC cards but not others.  The third reader refused to read a second card after the first was removed.  I definately like that the drive treats PC cards like removable media (with no starting and stopping of card services) and if you are a lucky or persistant buyer and they ship you a drive that works this would be a great deal.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Quality Control Problem", "unixReviewTime": 983836800, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2001"}
