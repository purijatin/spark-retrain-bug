It's like adding a whole new disk drive to your system and eliminates all the hassle of the upload issues.  I don't know how I ever got along without it.The installation of the unit was very simple, took about 30 seconds to connect it to the USB port in the back of the computer. The Setup Software was easy to run, no issues. Then I was in business.  The device acts like another drive, E:, so no special software is needed to upload pictures.  Simply copy from the E: drive to anywhere you want, most likely, the C:/My Pictures area.If you do have some specialized software, I have Microsoft Picture It 2002, this device works even better.  Picture It can access the photo right from the E: drive, you then edit the picture as needed, then save it to a permanent file.  This way, you only have edited pictures on your system.The use of this device does not tie up your camera. Simply take the media card out of the camera and put it into the device.  Put a second media card (you have two, of course) into the camera and your off to the races.A great timesaver, and use of resources.  This device should be Stanard Equipment on all digital systems that use a media card.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Should be Standard Equipment!", "unixReviewTime": 1015891200, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2002"}
