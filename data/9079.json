Installation was a snap. It handles the compact flash media for my MP3 player just fine (but format the CF on your MP3 player FIRST!) as well as the Smart Media card for my camera. File transfers were rapid--far faster than the USB transfer from my Nikon. The process of taking pictures, transfering to my PC, and then burning a CD ROM was greatly simplified by this handy tool. I can't believe I waited so long to buy one!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fastest Way to Upload Photos &amp; Download MP3s", "unixReviewTime": 1023926400, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2002"}
