It has two slots one for smartmedia and other for PCMCIA cards. Each slot appears as a drive letter under \"My Computer\". The compactflash card goes into an adapter which goes into the smartmedia slot.The read and write speed is very good.One problem I had - After installing the reader, I found that my Windows ME would hang during start up (on average once every 6-7 times). First I couldn't determine it was because of this reader, but then I discovered that the machine was hanging immediately after the red LED on the reader lits up. I downloaded the latest driver for this reader. It seems to have fixed the problem. The machine hasn't hung in two days.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good !", "unixReviewTime": 995328000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2001"}
