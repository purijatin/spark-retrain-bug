Even my friends who have other digital cameras (with USB and serial interfaces) complain.The Viking IntelliFlash USB Flash Memory Reader is easy to install and even easier to use.  Once setup is complete, it sets up 2 drives on your PC that reference each of the slots.  Just plug your SmartMedia or Compact Flash into the appropriate slot and you are good to go.  Transfers are VERY fast and effortless.  You will not be disappointed.FYI, I am running on a PIII/450 with 256MB of RAM running Windows 98.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Your Daddy's Oldsmobile", "unixReviewTime": 996969600, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2001"}
