You pop the cards into the CF adapter and slide the adapter into the reader. This shows up as a separate volume and you can drag items on and off of it as you do a hard drive. The setup was plug and play on the Macintosh. I installed the drivers, plugged in the unit and was in business. The included CF adapter can also be used in laptop computers with PCMCIA slots, an added bonus when you're on the road and want to quickly dump photos off of your CF card so you can take more pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A needed accessory for CF cards.", "unixReviewTime": 998438400, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2001"}
