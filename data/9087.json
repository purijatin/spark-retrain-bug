I had the correct drivers. When a device doesn't work with one computer, I normally blame the computer. When it doesn't work on TWO computers, I blame the product. I need a card reader but it is very unlikely I will buy anything from this manufacturer. I can't return the bloody thing so I am stuck with it (and out the money).", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Good that it's been discontinued", "unixReviewTime": 1044144000, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2003"}
