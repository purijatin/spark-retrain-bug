Manstrom", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "This is WONDERFULLY convenient, especially if you have more than one electronic device that uses SmartMedia or Compact Flash, as it will read both types of electronic media.  After over a month of use, I've had no problems with it.BUT, I did have one heck of a time installing it.  As noted by at least one other reviewer - if you have WinME, the software that comes with the unit is 100% useless.  Save yourself a few hours of frustration and get the drivers directly from the Viking website.  Only once (today, as a matter of fact) have I experienced a problem with my computer not recognizing the unit. A reboot did clear it up, but rebooting is never an acceptable &quot;fix&quot;, in my opinion.My rating loses one star for incomplete software &amp; the VERY occasional recognition problem.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great product - WinME users, read here!", "unixReviewTime": 1010966400, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2002"}
