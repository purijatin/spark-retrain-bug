It provides very fast transfer of images, preserves the batteries in my camera, and allows me to work from within any software package without using any special software (e.g., I've never had a software issue with this, unlike the special camera softwares).A very nice feature is that this unit can handle any kind of memory (other than Sony memory sticks); many competitors can handle just one or two.  BTW, this unit even works with microdrives as long as you use the type II compactflash adapter that should come with the drive.  My only real complaint is that using the adapter for compactflash memory cards is a bit inconvenient as you must insert the card into the adapter and then insert the adapter into the unit - no big deal but its an extra step.This is pretty essential, especially if your memory cards exceed the low end (8-16mb).  Its a great value, flexible in that it suports almost all memory types, and its reliable.  You'll be pleased when you buy it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty much an essential tool", "unixReviewTime": 973814400, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2000"}
