The instruction book was easy to read and concise.  Installed the software without reader hooked up, shut down PC (my step), plugged in reader, turn on PC (my step), insert smartmedia into lower slot, have 'my computer' find the removable media drive, and away we go.You don't use the eject button for smartmedia so I don't care if min eject button works or not.  The USB cable is rather short.  The reader's green light stays on all of the time and the red light comes on during read/write activity.  I am using the Olympus 64 meg smartmedia card.  Everything works like a charm on a Dell with Win98se software.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works like a charm", "unixReviewTime": 993340800, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2001"}
