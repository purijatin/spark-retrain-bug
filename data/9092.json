The camera uses a CompactFlash card, and the mp3 player uses the wafer-thin SmartMedia cards.  I wanted to have one peripheral to  read and write both of these without having to hassle around plugging and  unplugging my supposedly-portable camera and mp3 player.This reader fit  the bill perfectly.  After a one-click driver installation, I was able to  mount the CompactFlash and SmartMedia cards on the desktop, just like any  hard drive.  File management was a matter of dragging files on and off the  card in the Finder.  And it was perfectly compatible with the camera and  mp3 player, not to mention being much faster than either of those.  It  really is about 50 times as fast as the Coolpix's serial connection.Its  transparent blue color also matches my blue and white G3 nicely ;)I  recommend this product to Mac users without any reservations!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "plug-and-play with USB Macintosh", "unixReviewTime": 963532800, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2000"}
