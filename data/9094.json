The Viking unit was purchased as a replacement and has been flawless for 9 months and 1000s of transfers. It is better thought out, and this is apparent from the moment you open the box and notice how it is neatly and carefully packaged. I installed the Viking software (30 seconds, no options), rebooted and plugged the drive into my USB port. It was recognized by the OS and the correct drivers were installed and, voila, I was in business! I seems to read a little faster than the ScanDisk drive, has better indicator lights for on/active &amp; reading, and includes an adapter that allows you to use the CompactFlash card in your laptop without need of the larger drive. As a last little bonus, the drive can also read SmartMedia cards!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still simply perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 995328000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2001"}
