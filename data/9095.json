After downloading, I ejected the card, burning my fingers in the process! Upon reviewing the results of the download, I discovered that a number of the pictures did not transfer and were no longer on the CF card. When I called Viking, they informed me that they did not advertise their unit as working with Windows ME -- obviously my mistake. When I asked how this could cause the obvious overheating, they could not give an answer -- but more troubling -- they didn't seem to care! When I have a chance, I will retry with another computer with Windows 98 before I pack it up and send it back.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Windows ME users beware!", "unixReviewTime": 985564800, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2001"}
