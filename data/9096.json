Just put the CD in and connect the cable.  Put the card in and double click the icon and a couple of folders.  From then on it's just like using any other files.  You can rename, select all, copy, delete, whatever....I'm using mine with a 32mb SanDisk and Fujifilm finepix 1400 camera.  After your done uploading to your pc, you can just select all files on the card and delete.  A clean disk goes back into your camera.  There were no software conflicts for me.  In fact, I deleted the software that came with the camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works as advertised", "unixReviewTime": 985219200, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2001"}
