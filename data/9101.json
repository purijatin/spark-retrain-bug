Piersol \"buzzbo\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This is our most recent Smart Media card and we have had no compatibility issues with it.  We've been using the card for a year now with no problems in the following devices: Toshiba PDR-M60 digital cam, Lexar card reader, Dazzle card reader.  The 64MB card holds something like 200 pictures at the highest quality in our 2 megapixel camera, so we have been more than satisified.  If you've got a 3 megapixel or higher digital camera or you're using it to store tunes, I recommend jumping up to the 128MB Viking card.  These are great cards at very reasonable prices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Price - Great Card", "unixReviewTime": 1041292800, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2002"}
