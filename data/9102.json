What a super camera, so small. But I found after loading my mp3's and taking my movies, I had no memory left for pics. (fuji comes with a 16meg card) So I read the reviews on Amazon and noticed people said the Viking cards worked on the fuji cameras. (fuji needs a special ID memory smartcard for audio) So I purchased my Viking 64 meg smartcard from Amazon and I'm thrilled. According to what I have read , this is the maximum card you can use with this camera. Everything works. I can now take 51 pics in the 2400x1800 mode while holding my favorite mp3's and movie in the camera. Life is beautiful! Super price (can you believe the drop in smart card pricing?) Thank you ,Amazon and Viking!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Who could ask for more?", "unixReviewTime": 994809600, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2001"}
