It also works in PDA's perfectly, because a friend of mine has one with this exact same memory card.  I can only assume it works fine with digital cam's.  As far as mp3 players go, this is sure to work.  If you have a low memory mp3 player, get this if it can expand.  It works wonders.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works just fine", "unixReviewTime": 1022889600, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2002"}
