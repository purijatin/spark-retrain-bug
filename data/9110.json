Two things that are important though: 1. You much get the firm-ware upgrade from Diamond Multimedia for the Rio 500 (at least the older models) to recognize 64mb cards.2. Once you have formatted the card for use with a Rio 500, you cannot use it with other SmartMeadia devices.That said, the card has worked flawlessly over the year I have owned it.  I highly recommend it to bring your Rio 500 up to 2 hours of cd-quality music (I record at 128bits).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Used with a Rio 500 player", "unixReviewTime": 997056000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2001"}
