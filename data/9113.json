Overall, however, the picture quality (on non-converting playback) from this unit, at 300+ bucks, is lower than from our regular VCR, which is 8 years old, cost $80, and get this, wears the brand Admiral. But anyway, it works OK on the playback. Farewell, old salt...b) It sucks making tapes, however. We were feeding NTSC Hi8 video into it straight from the camcorder, and the PAL recording quality was attrocious, as if it were only half-converting the signal.So we took it to an authorized repair facility while still under warranty. No change. We sent it in to the Samsung facility in Jersey. When we got it back, it looked as if someone had literally taken a sledghammer to it. The box it came in was pristine, but the faceplate was smashed in. My theory--the repair tech figured it would be easier all around if we just got our money back. Which we did.And then we had all these PAL tapes sitting around, so we bought another (albeit for $80 less than we'd first paid.) Same thing: playback was OK, recording unacceptable.Recently, every tape we play is filled with electronic snow, and the warranty is over. Crap.3/2009 update:After writing the above review in '06, I found the solution to the snow problem among the other reviews here. Since then, it has functioned OK as an occasionally-used player. The Admiral, after 12 years of heavy use, finally gave up the ghost this winter, and moved on to its well-deserved rest.
