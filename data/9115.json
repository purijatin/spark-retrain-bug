It's not just an excellent worldwide VCR, but it also plays video images in such a crisp and clear quality, much better than my standard VCR's.  When I play a video from Germany the quality is exactly the same as when I play a video from the US or from any other country.  However, we did have a little trouble trying to set it up.  Since it's a worldwide VCR there was no TV channel that I could set it to ( 3 or 4). So the worldwide VCR had to have extra cable wires hooked up to my TV for it to work.  And then my second VCR had to be set to the channel Line.  It was also a huge inconvenience to call Samsung Technical Support, it took me two days to get someone to help.  There is another item with the VCR that I noticed, when a program has to be tracked it will automatically track it.  But for some reason the color goes black &amp; white (for about a split second).  Overall I really enjoy the VCR.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worldwide VCR", "unixReviewTime": 978220800, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2000"}
