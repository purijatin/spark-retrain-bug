It truly is a world tape converter. Easy to set up, and easy to play. There is very little that the manual does not cover. I basically just wanted a tape player, and then maybe a device, that would allow me to put PAL tapes to DVD.I think that what most people fail to take into account , is that this machine treats tapes the same way the players of the country of  origin  treat the tape ... basically, bad tape, bad playback.The only converter I have seen that does better is a DVD  converter.The only way to get a better playback is to get a VHS  player of the tape used by the original tape, and then use a Rack mount converter that are used in large studies (  priced from 2,000 to 7,000).This item does great for what it is, and what it is priced.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "excellent Player; Superb in its simplicity.", "unixReviewTime": 1097366400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2004"}
