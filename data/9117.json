The conversion quality is ok, probably better than with most other multi-standard in this price range and definitely better than my region-free DVD player, which produces pauses that are noticeable during fast movements.I have owned this VCR for 5 years now. I returned the first one under warranty for what I thought was a defect, but I now know was the Macrovision protection of my Sony VCR - I looped the signal through the other VCR before it reached the TV. The replacement has served us well for a long time - until my 2 year-old daughter force-fed it a Finding Nemo DVD. The DVD survived, the VCR did not. It does not load/unload cassettes properly anymore. I have been trying to figure out what the problem is, but the mechanics is complicated and fragile. I gave up and I am trying to replace it, only to find out that the sV-5000 is still the best choice out there. I will buy another one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "After all these years", "unixReviewTime": 1133136000, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2005"}
