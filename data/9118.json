It's also useful if you need to copy Pal to NTSC or vice versa.  The output quality is great and there are more features than we even need.  We've had it for a year now and no problems at all.  It gets used a LOT, and it seems to be holding up just fine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brilliant", "unixReviewTime": 1071273600, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2003"}
