I write for a living and often compose full articles this way--I call it my &quot;laptop killer.&quot;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the GoType Pro is subtly but significantly improved over the old model--namely, the key response is crisper, the angle of the keyboard is more comfortable, and the arrow keys have been repositioned. Being able to HotSync through the keyboard (with the included USB cable) is a nice perk. I often find myself writing on commuter trains, keyboard and Visor propped up on my knees--and as uncomfortable as that sounds, the GoType makes it fairly easy and managable. I'm thrilled with this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The &quot;Laptop Killer&quot; gets even better", "unixReviewTime": 977961600, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2000"}
