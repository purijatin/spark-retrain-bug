Bezdan", "helpful": [40, 40], "reviewtext": "I looked at both keyboards and wasn't as impressed with the Stowaway as  much as the Gotype.  The Gotype is a better value ($69 vs $99) since it  comes with word processing software and a thesaurus, plus fuctions as a  second cradle (even includes the USB cable).  What suprised me the most was  that I can type faster on the Gotype than I can on my PC, even though I  have pretty big hands.  The other plus is that it is stable and slightly  inclined, where the Stowaway sits flat and tends to curl on the ends which  causes it to bounce when you really get going.  I have also seen/heard of  the key caps popping off of the Stowaway, but I am told that in later  shipments this was corrected.  The only drawback to the Gotype vs. the  Stowaway is storage compactness; the Gotype is a bit harder to carry  around, though Landware does makes a case that allows you to carry both the  Visor and the Gotype together.  If you use your Visor the way I do, which  is for everything that I can think of, especially extensive note taking,  the Gotype is a must.  Be prepared to attract some attention the first time  you use it in public.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Preferred over the Stowaway", "unixReviewTime": 967939200, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2000"}
