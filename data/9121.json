Crawford", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This is a well-reviewed item, so I'll just voice a few points that are not necessarily obvious.1. The keyboard and its function keys were designed to be integrated with Landware's TakeNote word processor/book reader application. Unfortunately, that application was discontinued for download in 2002. TakeNote is one of those truly useful, simple PalmOS programs that is intuitive and just does what it's supposed to, plus there's some depth if you get into all its functions and use the function keys on the keyboard. Definitely worth getting this keyboard with the software on CD if you can.2. The keyboard is not meant to replace a full keyboard or one of those fold-out Targus or Palm keyboards. At the time this keyboard was in demand, it cost about $40 (on sale) compared to over $100 for the Targus or Palm keyboard. I recently got a Palm keyboard for $3. I wouldn't recommend paying more than $15 on eBay for the Landware keyboard if you can't get the TakeNote/WordSleuth disks. On the otherhand, it has a nice form factor which is well suited to airplanes, tiny student desks, etc.3. WordSleuth is for people who like thesauruses. When I used a Palm V with 2MB of memory, there was no way I was going to keep a thesuarus installed. A dictionary would have been useful.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great keyboard for small hands, TakeNote word processor a plus", "unixReviewTime": 1128816000, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2005"}
