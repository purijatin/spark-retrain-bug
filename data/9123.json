Bohlken", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "Initially I passed on the GoType! keyboard for my Visor Deluxe because the keys are smaller and closer together than a standard keyboard.  So I bought a Targus Stowaway.  But, it gave me annoying little software conflicts that meant it often did not work when I first attached the Visor.  (A soft reset followed by a warm reset solved these.)  I got used to the spacing on the GoType! keys very quickly.  I like the compactness of the GoType!  Although it is a little bother to set the Beam preference to &quot;on&quot; and enable the GoType! software before docking each time I use the keyboard, it is still easier and faster to set up than the Targus.  I love the fact that the software works each time everytime.  Once in a while I do have to do a soft reset.  Teamed with the free WordSmith software that came with my unit, it makes a very useful tool and is fast becoming my favorite mode of entering and editing text during my day.  I set it up when I arrive at my desk and leave it set up until I leave.  I only wish the Visor were firmly snapped into place when docked on the keyboard.  I am thinking of making two wire hooks joined by a rubber band.  I would place one over the top of the Visor and hook the other to the retractable supplimentary support foot.  I learned the hard way the unit will not work if you attach a jumper wire inside the Visor so you can charge on your cradle.  There is a web site that tells how to do that, but do not do it if you are planning to use the GoType! keyboard.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very pleased", "unixReviewTime": 1027123200, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2002"}
