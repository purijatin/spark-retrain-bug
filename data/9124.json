It has optical (as well as digital) zoom, a USB connection (essential since I use the Macintosh), a LCD preview that you don't have to use (which saves batteries), and a relatively small size. Given the price, it was definitely the way to go.Took the camera to Europe, and came back and viewed the pictures on-screen, as well as had them printed by Ofoto (\"trusted partner\"). The results are at about the same as with the film camera I brought. Since it was much smaller than the film camera, we used this one almost exclusively. My only real complaint is that there's no audible indication of when you're switching from optical zoon (better quality) to digital zoom (less quality). Given the price range and picture quality, I think this is the best camera to buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good value, with good features", "unixReviewTime": 997056000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2001"}
