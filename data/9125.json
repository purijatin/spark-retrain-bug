My usual methodology when trying something new is to read everything I can get my hands on and then take the plunge. So, starting with the fact that I have a 6 year old Dell desktop running Windows 95, I upgraded to Windows 98 and added a D-Link two slot USB card.  Then, after comparing features and quality against price, I chose the FugiFilm FinePix 1400.  So far, I think it's a good choice.  I was concerned there might be hardware/software installation problems because my USB was not factory installed but everything went smoothly.  I'm really impressed with the simple straightforward ease of taking pictures and the picture quality.  My desire is to overcome that feeling of disappointment when you get your pictures back from Walmart and they're not what you expected.  Digital is instant!  If you don't get the picture you want, shoot it again and erase the first one.  Very efficient.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Long way to get there!", "unixReviewTime": 983750400, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2001"}
