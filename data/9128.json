Actually, it is a little more complicated than I wanted because I'm not a techno junkie.  It takes great pictures and is quite compact.  I also bought the Kodak rechargeable batters and charger, a 32mb smartmedia card, and a case logic brand case.  The software was easy to install except you have to search to find the Adobe photodelux pgm.  I did have to get usb ports installed ...  I thought that would be better than having to buy a card reader.  The transfer from camera to pc is fast, but with the included software, you have to save each picture individually while the camera is running.  Instead, I learned to do it via My Computer by selecting all, copying all files, and pasting to a folder of my choice.  I would like to get a card reader, but I need to find a reliable one without problems.  In summary, the Fujifilm 1400 is a great entry-level camera.  We bought it over the 1300 because of the lens cover.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A best buy item", "unixReviewTime": 984960000, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2001"}
