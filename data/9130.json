The intangible qualities are what make this camera an excellent choice for anyone simply wanting great quality pictures from a camera that operates like a film camera, but has all the advantages of a digital camera.- The pictures are excellent (especially the color), although low-light pictures are a little grainier than I would like.- The flash is VERY powerful considering the camera's small size.- Stainless steel body seems very durable, feels solid in your hand- Camera operates very fast: turning on/off, menu navigation, shutter/autofocus delay, flash recharge, switching modes. In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of any digital camera, and most don't have it!- Battery life is excellent! Only 2 AA's easily last for a day of normal use. I usually get at least 2 days out of them. Fuji has really shown their excellence in this area... the power saving features have obviously made a huge difference.Conclusion: If you want a: 3X optical zoom, pocket-sized camera, for everyday use, that works like a film camera (i.e. very easy to use, and fast), feels like a high-quality product (not a cheap plastic toy), you MUST get this camera. You WON'T be dissapointed.WARNING: If you want extensive manual control, DO NOT get this camera. You WILL be dissapointed....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Real world\" excellence", "unixReviewTime": 1020297600, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2002"}
