The box for this camera states that it needs Windows 98, (not supported for Windows 95).  The USB drivers that come with the software won't work on Windows 95 (tried it with on an HP pavillion computer). Ended up buying a smartmedia card adapter that allows the card to be read from the floppy drive which works great....Also the camera is a little akward to hold, its not in the shape of a normal camera. and the lens zoom button is not the easiest to use either (it is on the back of the camera). The microphone for the AVI recording is on the left side of the camera, and its pretty easy to accidentally put your hand over it if holding the camera with both hands.The batteries also take a long time to recharge - 13 hours. Fortunately it came with two sets.The initial AVI clips we made didn't look that good when  viewed in quicktime 4.0, but when they played in the windows media player, it looked a lot better.  I didn't have time to figure out why.This camera was chosen for the better low light sensitivity (ISO 800) and the 3x optical zoom.  Otherwise I would have told my parents to get the Nikon S100 which I own (ISO 100 and only 2x optical zoom though).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not Win95 compatible", "unixReviewTime": 974160000, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2000"}
