I sent it back to Fuji when it was under warranty because it had a hard time recognizing the SmartMedia card. They fixed it promptly. Then I sent it to their repair company in California when it decided to turn itself off randomly. They fixed it and it worked for a while. Now it is acting up again.Now I love the results I get from the camera, but I wish it would work when I want it to instead of when it wants to.I'm about to send it in for repair under the warranty from the previous repair. If that doesn't work, I think I'll give up.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Camera when it Decides to Work", "unixReviewTime": 1028592000, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2002"}
