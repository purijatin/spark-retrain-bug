The colors are pretty. Compared with a Kodak, the colors are muted, easier on the eyes. The Kodak looked like a TV screen with the brightness and contrast overdone.I used it for about a year, and it quit. I must admit that I had dropped it hard once, and it had just gone through a mountain approach during a high wind advisory (I take it in my light plane). So, I really can't fault the camera. Turned out it needed a new flash board. Took 5 weeks and [amt] after sending it to Fuji NJ. I don't consider that bad service, and something you should think about before buying an off-brand asian wonder. I doubt any corner camera shop is doing to do much to a digital beyond cleaning.2400x1800 is great for digital zooming later. Or, for printing, but it is impolite for sharing photographs due to the upload time. It has 9 resolution settings. Three for # of pixels and within them three compression settings. I set it on 1280x960 and average compression. This gives me 99 pics on the supplied 32meg card, about 250k per pic, and great picture quality.The only criticism I can think of is that the flash stinks. I like a bounce flash, and this doesn't have the option. Red eye galore. You have to edit it out later. However, anything with a better or external flash is a lot bigger, so choose your tradeoffs.Scott", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A constant companion", "unixReviewTime": 1009670400, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2001"}
