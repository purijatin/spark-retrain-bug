Let's face it. Looking at shots on a computer monitor just does not compare to an almost life-sized image on the wall. Plus, although digital captures fine detail REALLY well, I still like the colors that only good slide film can give you. So I figured I would buy a good film body - one that can use the same collection of EF lenses that I already have for my digital. I wanted something more upscale than a Rebel. SO I figured I would pick up one of the many Elan bodies that SO many people are practically giving away in these days of digital. And I can honestly say that I am NOT disappointed. The controls are VERY intuitive - at least if you are already used to using a Canon DSLR. And virtually EVERY shot I have taken with this camera has come out at least decent. I would DEFINITELY say that this camera has it all over my Rebel XT when it comes to both exposure and autofocus accuracy. So if you still want to shoot some film, why not get an Elan IIe? As I said before, people are practically giving these things away these days. You can find bodies all day long for less than $100.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for those who still want to shoot some film from time to time!", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}
