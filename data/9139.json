It offers the user fully automatic or fully manual operation or as much help as you need with aperture and shutter speed priority modes as well as some custom modes for sports, portraits, landscapes, etc. There are three metering modes depending on the lighting although none of these is true spot metering.The autofocus on this camera is excellent and seems to be faster and more reliable than my canon eos 3, perhaps because of the infrared focus assist light. This camera also includes electronic gaze selected focus points which seems to work quite well on this camera for me.There are a number of custom functions, which occasionally come in handy like the depth of field preview and mirror lock-up. There is a hot shoe on top as well as a built in pop-up flash which I rarely use but occasionally comes in handy.The body is very sturdy and feels stable in ones hand, and of course, the back and right front mode selection wheels are a canon trademark which I happen to like very much.In summary, and in my humble opinion, this is a really top notch SLR and can be found for rock bottom prices right now on the used market. Before DSLRs took off, this camera body was used by many pros as a backup.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "film isnt dead", "unixReviewTime": 1217030400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2008"}
