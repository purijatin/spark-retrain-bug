This cable worked perfectly, no issues. Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tiny HDMI to standard HDMI", "unixReviewTime": 1273708800, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2010"}
