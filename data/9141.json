I resisted buying an automatic camera all this time because the electronics weren't good enough, or not intuitive enough -- in short, I wasn't going electronic until it did what I want.  After all, if I want to fiddle around, I've got a perfectly good manual camera.Then I found the Elan IIe.  I love this camera.  There are still a couple of things I prefer to do with the manual camera, but for most situations, this thing takes some fabulous pictures. It's light, it's reasonably durable, the batteries last halfway to forever (after 50-some rolls of film, I'm still using the original camera battery), and you can't beat the eye control (trust me -- calibrate it properly, and practice it with a roll or two of film, and it will not fail you).I've become especially fond of the IS lenses -- rather more expensive than the non-IS, but I can't believe how good they are.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm in love", "unixReviewTime": 970790400, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2000"}
