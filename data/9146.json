I read the other reviews of this lens and picked it up used for under $40 USD (delivered) in July 2013.  The lens focuses SUPER (amazingly) fast and very quietly on all my Rebel cameras (t5i, t4i, t3i, etc. [all my Rebel gear is APS-C]).  Used in aperture priority mode, this lens really SHINES.  Set it at f11 and forget it or open it wide up on a tripod or monopod and play around - the results are super sharp (and surprisingly so) for the price.  Compared to L glass, the color is not as vibrant on my copy especially leaning red and the contrast in low light is funky on this lens, but sometimes funky can be good (almost arty)! Play around and have fun!  Great lens to play with for VERY little money, and a real GEM at f11. Buy it for less than $40 and you can't go wrong!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better experience with this lens than most", "unixReviewTime": 1374624000, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2013"}
