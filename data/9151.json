Ahh, film.I have since graduated to a 24-70 f/2.8L II for this focal length range and I photograph professionally now. I couldn't have made it to where I am now without using this little guy, but it honestly wasn't very good. It wasn't very sharp, it has a variable aperture across the focal length range, it produces washed out colors, contrast is a little flat, and the bokeh doesn't look nice. All that being said, for less than one hundred dollars, this is a good deal. The autofocus speed is loud and slow, but you'll find that this lens serves an important purpose: it is a first lens. It will teach you how to compose, hand hold without IS, and manual focus. Those are all important skills.I know that there are better lenses that exist for a first lens, but none of them are as affordable as this little lens. For the price, this is a good deal. I'd also recommend it to someone who has child that wants to try photography, and you don't want to be too concerned that the lens will be destroyed by accident.Oh, I should also mention that I won a competition with a photograph of a baseball with this lens in 1998. It can perform, so don't write it off. Despite it's shortcomings, I think this is a lens that warrants consideration as an economy lens or as a backup lens.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lens holds a special place in my heart", "unixReviewTime": 1397260800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2014"}
