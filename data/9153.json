What I mean is that there is a piece of glass that covers the foot of the lens which prevents dirt and moisture from getting inside well dust anyway. The housing is really cheap plastic and the motor is painfully loud oh my this thing is loud. I would not try to use it in a setting where noise is an issue because this thing would wake the dead in a grave yard. It does take okay shots this would make a great lens for a child because they are cheap and if it gets broke your only out like 40 bucks.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not really worth the money unless...", "unixReviewTime": 1374883200, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2013"}
