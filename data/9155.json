It's not an L, no IS, no USM. It's an old lens technology; my lens was a remnant of the old EOS 10s film camera but it's an EF mount so it fits my new t2i.It's best for still photography or portraits with good lighting; not for sports. My photos of the orange tulip shows surprising results.What was pleasant was the lack of CA or purple fringing. Canon has CA that needs to be corrected post but this lens doesn't need it.Do a search about a macro hack for this lens. Then you might change your mind about this cheap but capable lens.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cheap but pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2012"}
