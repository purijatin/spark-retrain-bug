One of the lenses came loose in the old one but the price was really good and it worked for all that time so I replaced the original with another one just like it. It's cheap but it works much better than the price would indicated.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Low price but it works", "unixReviewTime": 1357084800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2013"}
