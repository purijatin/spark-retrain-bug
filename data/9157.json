Christian \"citizensmith\"", "helpful": [21, 22], "reviewtext": "So this is a great starter lens, it came with my canon body when I got my camera, and I've used it tons.  It is light, smooth, fast to focus, and cheap.  My only problem was the number of times I found myself stepping back because the 35mm end of the zoom wasn't wide enough.  I now carry a 22-55 instead and love that lens (come on Amazon - get it in stock).  If you're on a budget then this lens is great.  If you can afford the little extra go for the 28-80 instead.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Small, Fast, but a little limited", "unixReviewTime": 972950400, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2000"}
