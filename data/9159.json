AF works just fine and is very quiet.  The overall picture quality is on a par with a kit lens.  You can get very sharp photos with this lens if you stop it down a bit . F-8 works great!  If I had to buy this lens again, I would get the VR verson for a little more money.  Hence the 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Canon EF 35-80mm.
