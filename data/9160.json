{"reviewerID": "AULFLNWJP1QXY", "asin": "B00004THCY", "reviewerName": "Technology Guy", "helpful": [31, 35], "reviewtext": "This is the first SLR lens I ever used. Not a very memorable experience, I have to say. The lens is cheaply made, not at all sharp, has a very limited zoom range and is very, very, very slow. The lens is so slow that it really isn't useful indoors at all without a flash. The wide end of the zoom range - 35mm - is insufficient for landscapes while the telephoto end - 80mm - doesn't offer enough reach for distance shots. The build actually feels as if the zoom and focus mechanisms use internal cardboard components. I would be hard-pressed to find another EOS Canon or third-party lens that was as uniformly mediocre in all respects.Instead of this lens, I would very highly recommend the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II which is sharper than this or any lens you can find for twice the price. Granted, the 50mm isn't a zoom lens but the limited range of the 35-80mm doesn't offer much of an advantage anyway. AND the 50mm is nearly 3 f-stops faster needing only one-eighth as much light for a shot making it great choice for indoor and dim lighting conditions.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disposable Kit Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1168473600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2007"}
