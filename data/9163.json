I already own EF-S 55-250 IS which is great but  the zoom is limited. This EF lens has 300 zoom which is equivalent to 480 on my T3i. I thought lack of IS will make a big difference. It did not in sunlight or cloudy day. I bumped up the shutter speed to 600+ and also increased ISO (400-3200 depending upon sunlight). At full 300 mm zoom I got amazingly sharp pictures of Cardinals and Finches in my backyard. It does not perform well in low light and indoor but who would want to use a super telephoto indoors. Usually I use it outdoors for nature photography or sports. In both scenarios I think it works great. Make sure shutter speed is 600+. 800 or 1000 is great. Play with ISO until you get nice well lit pictures.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Lens if used correctly with manual settings", "unixReviewTime": 1367539200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2013"}
