I would say its quality is better than this one (from all the reviews I've read).I was considering getting the 75-300 for the added zoom only, but decided to run an experiment. I took a picture with my 18-135 lens with the best possible settings at 135mm. Then  I cropped the picture to get the equivalent of what the 300 would have given me. Even zooming in in the pictureI got me pretty good results. I haven't tried the 75-300 as such (they have a pretty lousy return policy here) but I can bet it will give me no better results. So I saved myself $150.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Can do without it", "unixReviewTime": 1306713600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2011"}
