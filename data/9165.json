I'm a novice camera user, and this is my first telephoto and found it incredibly easy to use. I could see where complaints would come for the expansion when zooming, and when using it with a lens hood, it's pretty long. However, it's a very inexpensive lens and it took great pictures on my recent vacation (posted in the photos section). I was able to sit on the beach and take pictures of my kids playing in the water and be right in the action. Combine the usefullness with the amazing price and the lens is a 5-star value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredibly Useful Tool", "unixReviewTime": 1325980800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2012"}
