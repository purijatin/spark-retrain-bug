I'm using it on a T2i and I get decent results, but like everyone says, IS would really help at those longer focal lengths. I'm going to start looking for the 55-250mm which looks great. This lens will get you started in telephoto photography, and I've even made some decent photos with it, but having to shoot at f/8 all the time sucks. Focus speed is decent but it has a very long way to go from infinity to 3 feet and it will hunt back and forth sometimes which makes me want to throw the lens off of a speeding train. I also think one reason for having a tele is to capture detail of something in a tight frame, and at 75 to around 250 this lens does an okay job, but at 300mm the detail gets lost, even it you get good focus and are stopped down. Bottom line, get something else.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "get something else if you can", "unixReviewTime": 1310428800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2011"}
