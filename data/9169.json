Quick shipment, nice packaging and brand new product.When I first saw it, it was not as good as 18-135 mm lens on my Canon 60D in building and look.  However, it does its job well in terms of  the light weight and price.  The quality of pictures are acceptable as well. I am happy to have it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quick shipment.
