I was concerned by some of the reviews complaining about the lens being slow to focus.  I did not find this to be a problem, however, it does on occasion decide to run the focus all the way one direction and then come back to the proper point.Some people complained that it randomly decided what to focus on.  To those people I say, READ YOUR CAMERA's MANUAL!  There is an option to select what point in your view your camera's auto focus will focus on and this is NOT a flaw of the Lens!When I left my Canon Rebel XS in Full Automatic mode, it decides on the point.  Put it in a more manual mode, pick the point you want it to focus on, and it works fine.  See page 102 of the Canon EOS manual.Bottom line, if you are stepping up from a point and shoot or don't want to spend $500-$2000 on a lens, this is a great buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great lens for the price!!", "unixReviewTime": 1248566400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2009"}
