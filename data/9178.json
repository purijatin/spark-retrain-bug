In bright light, there is considerable chromatic aberration. This can be corrected in post production, but if you take a lot of photos, this can be very labor intensive. If money is not a huge issue, then spring for a more expensive lens like the Sigma 18-250mm f3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM or the Tamron SP AF 70-300mm f4.0-5.6 Di VC USD. The cost benefit of the time saved in post production is well worth it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Canon EF 75-300mm", "unixReviewTime": 1380672000, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2013"}
