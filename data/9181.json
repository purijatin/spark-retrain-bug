Although not fast on the AF mode (it is far better to focus manually when you are photographing Wildlife -- especially Birds) ... it does respond well enough when you are awaiting that 'perfect' moment (you have the patience to wait for -- like with landscapes).  This is one lens that I keep in the bag all the time.  Eventually ... I'll upgrade to the IS version, but for now .. a good economical alternative to use in the meantime.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Useful Zoom Lens for Most outdoors events", "unixReviewTime": 1209945600, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2008"}
