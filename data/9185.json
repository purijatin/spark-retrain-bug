I did the 2 day shipping because I was worried that I wouldn't get it in time for Christmas. Packaged very good. Arrived faster than delivery date. My mother just bought a Canon DSLR and she was worried about not having a zoom lens because she was used to the digi cams, so I bought her this lens. We tested the product and seems to be working like it should be. :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fast Shipping before Christmas!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1324166400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2011"}
