Yes at 300mm the optics are a little iffy and image stabilization would be a plus, but you get what you pay for. I got this lens new for $105 so I'm not one to complain about its optical performance. I get the zoom I need and I'm content. I'll find ways to work out the hand-held shakiness at 300mm by making sure I can have a fast shutter speed. Obviously you can't correct it's optical quality, so what I recommend; get the lens now if you need the zoom and sell it when you're ready to buy a better telephoto zoom. If you don't need the zoom now; keep saving for a higher quality lens.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for, but that's not such a horrible thing.", "unixReviewTime": 1324771200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2011"}
