Brown \"Brandon Brown\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "Well, I read a lot of reviews of this lens, most of them negative so of course I was a little skeptical about buying this lens. I've been testing it out for a while and yeah I do admit the auto focus is kinda slow, but its alright since a lot of the time I manually focus it myself and since it isnt sticky i can do it fairly quickly and ive gotten a lot of sharp, clear pictures. Of course it can not compare to any of canon's L lenses but for the beginner or amateur photographer on a tight budget, or even a professional photographer that wants a decent backup lens, this one is great. It is fairly quiet which is a plus. A lot of people complain about it not having an ultra sonic motor or that its not good for action shots but those attributes are obvious before you even purchase the lens, those are the reasons why canon happened to make a version of this lens with the ultra sonic motor for faster auto focus. I use this lens on my Canon EOS rebel T1i and again it takes very sharp clear shots, and I have even done a few action shots with this because I always have my ISO speed on 3200 or 1600 so I can use faster shutter speeds, and when its extremely bright outside I set my shutter speed to 1/4000 (the fastest it can go) and if I need to I will lower the ISO speed or adjust my aperture. Now I do realize not everybody's SLR or DSLR can do the same settings I use and I know a lot of people prefer to not use such a high ISO so its really just personal preference. And a lot of complaints I have heard sound mostly like user error.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good lens", "unixReviewTime": 1276560000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2010"}
