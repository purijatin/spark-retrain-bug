I tested it today on my GE DV-1 video recorder and used to to connect to my LCD tv's hdmi port. THe mini hdmi end went in the camera and the large end in the TV. It worked fine. I will just leave it plugged into my HDMI port 3 all the time, so I will be able to hook up the camera to it for big screen viewing whenever needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "works great so far!", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014"}
