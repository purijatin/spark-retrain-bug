Brault", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "As a novice photographer it's easy to get caught up in the cost of the all equipment one may want or need. Great equipment costs a lot. This lens is great compromise. I never thought I would need a telephoto zoom, but Amazon made it an easy decision to purchase when with a discount for buying a new camera brought the cost to $30. I'm glad I jumped at the chance. Even at full price, this lens is a great value for its construction and capabilities. This is definitely the next lens to step up from the kit lens. With the proper person, the proper camera, lens hood and filters, this lens takes fantastic images. Images from the dog show this weekend are visually stunning. If you feel that you can have good camera control with a steady hand (as this lens lacks image stability), and you are looking for a great entry level telephoto zoom lens, then this lens is a fantastic choice. Thanks Amazon and Canon for helping me take some photos that will last a lifetime.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Novice Photographer - Starter Telephoto Zoom", "unixReviewTime": 1347840000, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2012"}
