It was ready to use the minute it was taken out of the box. Quality in both low light and normal light has been excellent. It is lightweight thus carrying an extra lens is not an issue. These lens are much smaller in size than the Nikon lens I use for my Nikon cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Canon Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1262390400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2010"}
