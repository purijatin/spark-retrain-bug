Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Bought to mount 46\" LCD", "unixReviewTime": 1360281600, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2013"}
