It's quite a nice lens...Whoever is looking at this one, is because want's a TELE to take some snaps with your dSRL...Extreme Photographers may not like these ones.. Many adjectives might be said... Slow (focus and F), Bulky, etc...But I am pleased with when using it on outdoor pics... If you are thinking about using it on indoor pictures, better have a tripod and also use a high ISO, specially at 300mm.the USM on it play it's role and I don't think it is slow as I have seen in some other reviews around here..But, for the price I paid and with my Rebel XT, and again, if you are looking for a good TELE lens, I would recomend it, but be aware that is has it's limitations...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Lens...", "unixReviewTime": 1127088000, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2005"}
