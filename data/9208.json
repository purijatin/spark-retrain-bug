I've been looking for a decent zoom lense for an offordable price for awhile and decided to give this one a shot.  I can honestly say that I am not at all disapointed.  Although you cant compare it to a $500-700 lense with IS ;look at the price.  If you are on budget like me and looking for a decent lense, this one will get the job done.  I found that at 300mm it get a little blury if you dont use the tripod, but still this lense give an exceptional images.  I love to go to a park and sneak up on birds, very happy with the quality.  I hope my experience help some of you.  My advice is do a little research because what is good for other people maynot be right for you.  Happy shooting!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great lense on a budget", "unixReviewTime": 1145318400, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2006"}
