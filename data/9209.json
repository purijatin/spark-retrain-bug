I didn't really know much about cameras before getting my latest Canon T2i and this lens. I know it is 75mm-300mm, but I didn't realize you had to be 5 ft away to get a decent close-up shot; more my fault.  Otherwise, this lens has a great zoom capability and it's easy to operate.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good lens", "unixReviewTime": 1322179200, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2011"}
