You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I haven't tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but I'm sure it would work.So I would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable mini-HDMI to HDMI cable that works and is long.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product and Cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1325376000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2012"}
