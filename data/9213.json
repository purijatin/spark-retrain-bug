I'm left wanting an image-stabilized lens though because i have found it difficult to get consistently good results with this lens without the constant use of a tripod. I have years of slr photography experience and a very steady hand, I can get clear shots at 1/20th of a second with a 50mm focal length. With this lens, its difficult even at 1/200th of a second, which is about an average exposure time for this lens in daylight at 100-200 ISO. The lens is also slow to autofocus and somewhat inaccurate, causing some photos to come out slightly blurry. If you really have to have a zoom lens now and can't afford an IS lens, this one's not a bad choice. But if you can wait, save your money and get an IS lens with faster focusing and better optics. You'll be glad you did.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "not bad but clearly entry-level", "unixReviewTime": 1168905600, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2007"}
