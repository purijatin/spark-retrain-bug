The lens is great in good sun light, BUT once the sun goes down, you are screwed. I shoot with a Digital Rebel, and this lens with indoor sports at ISO 1600 ain't pretty. The lens has taken a lot of heat on the web for slow focusing and being soft at 300mm - hard to argue this. The lens is amazingly sharp when you're at around 100mm, but the longer you reach, the less sharp it becomes, and that can be bad news if you're shooting something in the distance and plan to crop heavily (outfielders, birds etc). But if you're like me and can't afford a ridiculous $5,000 lens, this one will make you happy, for the cost and abilities, it is well worth it's price. Would I sell it after buying a better lens? Probably not -- it is light and easy to carry. Play to this lens' strengths and you'll get some nice results. I have the hood and don't see any noticeable differences. I took a few shots once with the IS version and didn't notice much of a difference either.
