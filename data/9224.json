And when adorama.com says \"excellent condition\",they mean it! This lens was in new/mint condition. I'll buy my next lensfrom adorama without a doubt. I bought this lens to replace my 80-200zoom for I wanted greater range. Many reviews state that at the high-endthis lens isn't quality. I beg to differ. I've taken many photos atthe 300mm setting (hand held) and seen crisp, clear and amazing results.For the price, it's an outstanding lens. The build quality is greaterthan my former 80-200mm because it seems more solid and has a metalmount.I give it a 4 out of 5 for sure. It's not the USM so it's slower tofocus. But I own other USM lenses and I can't tell a major difference.That's why I opted to try this lens out. She's a keeper....", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Lens for the Price!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1194825600, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2007"}
