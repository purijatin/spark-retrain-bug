Hung", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "This was my first EF telephoto lens when I transitioned to DSLR over five years ago. The first copy I got was part of my EOS 20D kit and it was a dud. Its AF was broken. I exchanged it afterwards. I didn't use it a lot. The only time I used this lens extensively was in Santa Cruz shooting the Monarch butterflies hanging off the trees. Overall, the picture quality coming out of this lens was not that bad. It 's just soft and you do need a tripod as this lens is quite slow. It would definitely help with IS. There are certainly more room for improvement. When Canon introduced the EFS 55-250mm, I quickly replaced the EF75-300mm with that, and it was a day and night difference. I don't know why Canon still continues to produce it. Although it is full frame compatible, I don't think anyone wants to use it on a 1D or 5D. It just doesn't make sense. Get the EFS 55-250mm instead. It's not that more expensive. You gain a UD glass element and IS. Picture quality is a lot better, and you 'll be a lot more happier.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "EF 75-300mm F4-5.6", "unixReviewTime": 1288828800, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2010"}
