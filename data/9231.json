Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf...My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots.This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range.We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it.I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great fun for an Amteur!", "unixReviewTime": 1155600000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2006"}
