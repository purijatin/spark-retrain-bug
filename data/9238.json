For the money you get a pretty big zoom range and ok quality in good light.  For a little more you can get the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6.  The 100-300 features ring-type USM which allows full-time manual focus--that means you can adjust the focus manually without switching to manual mode.  Also the focus is quicker and quieter without rotating or extending the front element so the use of circular polarizers is easier.If you can afford the extra money, I would recommend the 100-300 as a budget telephoto zoom.  If not, this one is ok but not good.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok for the money, but there are better options...", "unixReviewTime": 1156982400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2006"}
