All of a sudden you get a message that the lense can not communicate with the camera, ( Clean your contacts ) well clean your contacts all you want it will not fix the problem.  The problem is internal in the lense.  The good news is you can send the camera off to Canon with an estimate repair cost of about $ 130 dollars, the bad news for a few dollars more you can buy a new one.  Bottom line do not buy this lense buy a better one for a few hundred dollars more, in the end you will get much better pictures and it will work much longer then the year mine did.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Cheap works ok until it breaks", "unixReviewTime": 1330819200, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2012"}
