The shots come out sharp, clear, and colorful. This includes plenty of action shots of dogs running and playing.The auto-focus works fast, and is quite accurate. I doubt if the USM version of this lens is worth the extra money. In fact, I just got the Canon 55-250 IS, and I find the auto-focus to be faster and more accurate on this less-expensive 75-300 lens. Unfortunately, it does lack IS, so it may not do well using hand-held in low-light situations. But, it absolutely rocks using it hand-held in outdoor sunlight.The build quality seems quite good, with a nice, solid look and feel. The zoom ring isn't as fluid as much more expensive lenses. But, that is to be expected.Overall, an excellent value, especially for Rebel users. After all, do you really want to spend more for your telephoto zoom lens than you paid for your body/lens kit in the first place? If you have a high-end EOS model, then you should certainly spring for an L-series lens. But, for a Rebel, this guy does the trick, and does it well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Value", "unixReviewTime": 1231286400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2009"}
