While zooming in at 300mm, you gotta shoot at 1/300 or faster to avoid fuzzy image (if shooting w/o tripod) right? Well, how can you do it if the max aperture at 300 mm is only 5.6? Only on a bright cloudless day. What are the chances that ALL of your images you will be taken on a bright sunny day?Or you can use a tripod for all your images.One good thing is, the lens is rather fast when auto focusing.I ended up selling it on craigslist.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Waste of money", "unixReviewTime": 1286841600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2010"}
