It is fast and quiet, and delivers sharp images. Used in conjunction with a 2X teleconverter it becomes quite the &#34;scope&#34; for your camera. It has no IS feature, but I have not found that to be an issue, due to the fact that it's better to shut that function off while using a tripod. For the price, it out-performs the more expensive fancy models and weighs less doing it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Reach out to someone", "unixReviewTime": 1381881600, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2013"}
