I didn't think photography could get any better. It did.The first day I used this lens, I was shooting photos of a biplane plummeting at an airshow. Having been used to my older equipment, I thought, &quot;No way can I hold 300mm still enough, but what the heck, film is cheap.&quot; I was wrong. That photo was crystal clear, and instead of a tiny blur in the midst of sky, I have a very clear image of the plane filling the frame.The lens has been responsible for getting me up close in many places since, most recently capturing Al Gore and his entourage on the pilot house of the riverboat that travelled the Mississippi the day after the convention. If you are looking for a versatile lens that gives great results under many conditions, this is it. It really is hard to take a bad photo when using it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Makes every photo look like a prizewinner", "unixReviewTime": 971395200, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2000"}
