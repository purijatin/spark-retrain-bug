This particular lens features Canon's micro Ultra Sonic Motor; therefore, it does not have the same focusing performance of the standard USM designs.  Optically, it is the same lens as the EF 75-300 III, and performs roughly the same.  Usually, this lens retails for more than the non-USM design, but I'd pay little more.  An oddity on Amazon has often had the price of this lens lower, and that's a good deal.As previously stated, the lens is a solid performer.  Good lens speed, but not as fast of focusing as the EF 100-300.  Additionally, the front of the lens rotates, which is not as nice when using filters such as polarizers.  The plastic barrels are OK, but zooming is a bit less smooth than desired.Canon also doesn't include much with the lens.  A lens shade is very useful for outdoors photography, and Canon is very pricey on an accessory that most include.  Canon's one-year warranty is also poor compared to most others.For a good alternative, look at the Tamron / Promaster 70-300 LD lens which has closer focusing, includes the shade, and both offer longer warranties.  However, neither are as quiet as the Canon lenses.For an upgrade, look at the Canon EF 100-300 USM, which offers a smoother, faster USM, and no filter rotation.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good, average telephoto zoom.", "unixReviewTime": 1151020800, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2006"}
