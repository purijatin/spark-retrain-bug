It's good value for the money, but there's better lens in the Canon line that won't break your bank either.You want to move up to the lens with the same description except for one thing, it will say USM. Those are the motors that autofocus uses. They're quieter and they work better. There are people that cite problems with autofocus. If you're buying this lens, you are probably using it on a body that is more limited in controlling the AF.But buy the other lens for about 30-40 more.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "move up one more small notch", "unixReviewTime": 1231286400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2009"}
