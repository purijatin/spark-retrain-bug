Many reviewers reguard this as a LOW END LENS, poorly constructed and won't reep sharp images. As with any lens you do need to receive a good copy as I did. I use this lens mounted to my Rebel XT and have taken over 500 photos at 300mm with excellent results! I do not use One Shot Auto Focus, for best results you should set the Camera focus to AI SERVO which enables the Lens into FULL TIME FOCUS, this will lock all focus points to get crisp/sharp images, if you try that you will see how well this lens will preform! I do own the standard kit lens + The EF-S 17-85mm Is Lens + The EF-S 10-22mm IS lens. For the money you can't beat this lens, I paid $189.99 for it and have no complaints! Canon has a New Lens due to be released in Sept,05...a 70-300mm version with IS and has a retail price of $649.99! This is something I would be interested in testing, but I am very pleased with the results I receive with the lens I have!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "EXCELLENT LENS/VALUE FOR THE $$$$$$$$$$$$$", "unixReviewTime": 1125100800, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2005"}
