No, it doesn't have IS,(400 bucks for a Canon 250mm) no, it's not a (L) lens, (1,500 bucks). But for the price and the expandability it offers it was a good purchase. I kills me to see people pay 150 bucks for a lens, then bash it because it isn't a 1,500 dollar lens. We would all love to have one of those. This is a good lens for what it is, a manual focus on distant objects lens. One way to get around the \"hunting\" on auto focus, is to put the camera on spot metering. And if you want even quicker shooting, just flick the camera to auto, let it do the work. This allows the camera to pinpoint the focus on a single spot. It actually stays on the camera 80% of the time, with the lower 75mm rating on zoom, it's just a little closer than the 55mm kit lenses, but with the quick ability to go to 300mm. One of the reasons I chose the Canon was the ability to use older EF lenses thus saving money and expanding as I go. I still feel it was a great purchase and don't regret it at all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great purchase for the novice", "unixReviewTime": 1296518400, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2011"}
