Now over a year later, it still works just as good as it did on day 1. It is a sturdy lens with the EF metal mount that makes it more reliable than the plastic mounts. The only con with this lens is, that it isn't equipped with an image stabilizer. When shooting at 300mm, if you have wind or a shaky hand and you are shooting without a tripod, you may expect some less than perfect results. But besides that, a great lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great cheap lens", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2013"}
