But I would say if you can afford $100 for a lens then these are pretty good. But I would recommend saving up or footing the bill for a more expensive one, as you get good shots with this, but I think they could be better. I have a T2i and the shots I get from this are decent, but I have a feeling could be a lot better with a higher quality lens. It's good for the price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "it's ok", "unixReviewTime": 1342569600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2012"}
