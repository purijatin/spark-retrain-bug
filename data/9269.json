Gagliano", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewtext": "I can not afford the best in the world from Canon and this lens is what I expected for the money. It's not like my best lens when it comes to feel, quality and construction but, for the price, it's a good deal. You must be careful when installing it on the camera becasue it doesn't \"snap\" in place like the kit lens. Just make sure it's on and all is well. The picture quality is good and crisp. the colors are good so over all, I have no complaints. I have a 55-250 and bought the 75-300 for a little more zoom and am happy I did.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a bad deal for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1302912000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2011"}
