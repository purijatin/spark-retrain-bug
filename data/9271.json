Jeffery", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought this lens on a killer clearance deal after missing an opportunity for some nice shots of a coyote.  I just wanted a simple lens for an occasional wildlife snapshot.  The image quality was so bad, I took it right back to the store.  It is unlikely my expectations were too high, as I love my Rebel XTi (400D) kit lens, which is considered one of Canon's worst.  I picked up a Tamron lens of similar focal length and have been reasonably happy with it.  I'd steer clear of this one unless you just want an SLR to look cool.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor image quality", "unixReviewTime": 1231718400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2009"}
