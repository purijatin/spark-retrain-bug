I find it's very soft at the 300mm lens length. It is slow, f4 is the fastest at 70mm and f5.6 at the full telephoto.I tried it in various situations:1. For nature photography, I was grabbing a shot of a rare bird while hiking. It was not a great photo. The softness was annoying, though I got an acceptable enough shot for identification. IS (Image Stabilization) would have helped in this application, but this lens doesn't have that added feature.2. I put it on a very stableAmazonBasics 70-inch Adjustable Pistol Grip Head Tripodwhich is not a hiker's tripod but a very heavy, 10lb beast of a tripod that is going nowhere when you set it up. I photographed the moon at 300mm, using a remote shutter release. I didn't stop down the lens (perhaps that would have been better) but I was using a 1/10 second exposure and shakes happen even on tripods. The photo was sharp enough to see craters at the edge of sunlight on the surface, but they weren't razor sharp. The entire effect was soft (admittedly, we have pollution and it was a cloudy morning.)You pretty much have to use a tripod with this lens unless it's brilliant sun outside and even then...If you must have this length (and it is a handy one for sports and even candid portraits) then it's a budget choice. But compared to my 55-250mm, it's a lot softer and just not quite \"the thing.\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Meh (or in more technical terms, cheap lens, soft focus, slow)", "unixReviewTime": 1387670400, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2013"}
