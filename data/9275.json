Ramirez", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "The lens is an entry level lens and would be well served to have IS built in.  But even in ideal conditions (good lighting, fast shutter speed, tripod mounted), it is still a subpar performer.  The images aren't crisp and sharp and the colors are a little flat.  It does allow for a nice enough bokeh (background blurring) when taking photos of someone 15 feet away or so.  Generally that isn't easily accomplished by the 18-55 kit lens.Good photos can be taken with this lens... but more photos will be lost due to blurring or simply not being crisp enough.If you are on the fence as to whether you will use your DSLR, then this may be a good option.  If it turns out you really like it, then invest in the 55-250mm.  If you are starting out and you KNOW you will like it, then invest in a 55-250mm from the start.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "It's not a good lens, but a good value for a beginner.", "unixReviewTime": 1307232000, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2011"}
