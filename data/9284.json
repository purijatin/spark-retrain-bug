I just got this lens and wow, I love it! Gives that great upclose/shallow depth of field look for portraits. It's wonderful. I couldn't ask for a better telephoto lens to start out w/. I'm sure this probably isn't the best lens for some higher end professional shots, but for starting out, especially w/ portraits this is an awesome lens. I'd definitely recommend it to other beginning photographers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great starter telephoto", "unixReviewTime": 1303257600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2011"}
