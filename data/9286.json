I've found it to be well worth the money for the use I've gotten out of it.Between about 100-200mm, this lens takes great portrait shots/head shots. Out of focus elements behind the subject look okay-- not super smooth like the higher end lenses but not too bad either. The lens does suffer from some chromatic aberration, even when stopped down to f/8 or so, but it is not particularly bad.If using this lens to capture a subject that is far away from you, such as a bird or other woodland critter, you will likely need a tripod. There is no image stabilizer in this lens, so if you are zoomed in all the way on a subject 100 yards away or so, things can get pretty shaky if you are using your camera handheld. Even when shooting in a good amount of light, I've found that I need a tripod to really capture those far away subjects without any motion blur resulting from slight movements of the camera.This lens is also a \"macro\", which means it can focus on subjects very close-- useful for wedding rings, flowers, insects, etc. While it's not a \"true macro\" lens like some of Canon's other offerings, it's good enough to get some nice photos of insects and other small objects.Not as sharp as Canon's higher end lenses, either, but sharper than the kit lens. If you can afford it, I would recommend the \"IS\" (image stabilized) version of this lens.For those on a budget who are trying to supplement their kit lens and give themselves a longer reach when they need it, or for those who want a nice headshot lens without spending very much, I would highly recommend adding this lens to your kit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Portrait Lens and Telephoto; great addition to your kit if on a budget", "unixReviewTime": 1370822400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2013"}
