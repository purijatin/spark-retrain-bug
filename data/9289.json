My camera shop was kind enough to remind me I could return it if I were not happy with it. I kept it and have used it several other times with great results on my Digital Rebel. Other than agreeing that there seems to some soft focus if you hit the 300 stop point,  the performance of this lens has been a very pleasant surprise - especially when you factor in the price.  This is a real lens with a metal lens mount and a fast USM motor that makes focusing instantaneous.  I have also found it to be no problem hand holding this lens despite the higher effective focal length since it is mounted on a digital.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value", "unixReviewTime": 1076716800, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2004"}
