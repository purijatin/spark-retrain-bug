I am now using much more expensive L series lenses. I still have the photos that I took with this lens on my hard drive, however, and technically they are great. For the price of this lens they are remarkably great. Very low distortion, no CA and razor-sharp images. I am saying this after looking at pictures just this week, after a few years of honing my photo skills and my photoshop eye. I am very sensitive (some have said too sensitive) to defects that can only bee seen at 100%-200% and I do not see any in the pictures taken with this lens. I have seen many when looking at the pictures from the 85mm f1.8 lens, for instance.The lens was mated with a Rebel XT when I took those pictures, incidentally, which frankly it is meant to be. This is not a lens to be mated with a semi-pro or pro body. I'm not sure what the results would be there. They would probably be pretty good with a 40D but with a 5D I don't know. Again with the Rebel they were great, and I think given the cost of this lens it is meant for a camera like the Rebel. For the price this really can't be beat if you are shooting with a Rebel, Rebel XT or Rebel XTi. 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more. It is supposed to be a competent lens for a low price and it ends up being a great lens at a low price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Undeserved negativity.", "unixReviewTime": 1223251200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2008"}
