Sheridan", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "For the price and range of this 75-300 zoom it probably cannot be beat, but don't expect to actually have consistently sharp photos when shooting at 300mm. The 4-5.6 aperture allows you to shoot handheld with decent sharpness in the daytime, however to really get a sharp image stopping down to f8 is needed and by then hand holding is only an option in very bright sun.Auto focus is not perfect but generally finds the subject quick enough.Lens has no zoom lock, so when the lens is facing downward, while photographing or just walking, the lens will extend due to gravity, which is kind of annoying.The size and weight of lens is pretty small and light when considering a 300mm zoom.All and all this lens was a very good purchase when I bought it 6 years ago for $130 on ebay. Although now after using a few Canon L lenses, I find myself not wanting to take this out of the bag because the sharpness is disappointing. However again it must be said, it is probably the cheapest way you can get a zoom of this range and still have usable images.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Value, poor sharpness.", "unixReviewTime": 1197590400, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2007"}
