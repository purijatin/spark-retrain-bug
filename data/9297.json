It was within my limited budget and I was worried that I would regret the lack of image stabilization.  I do not.  This lens takes amazing canon lens quality photos.  I would have some remarkable images of squirrels but I forgot to put the SD card in.  Baring that, I do live near a small airport, and have some great pictures of pilots in their planes.  They came out amazing from over 1/2  a mile away I was able to read the numbers on the side of the plane.  Also bird pictures are very sharp.  I photographed a woodpecker about 35' away and was able to crop out a very detailed and sharp image of his head.  The contrast of colors is very good.  I have not tried the lens at night, and this may be where I wished I had the shelled out the extra money for the IS version.  But my night vision ain't what it used to be so if I can't see it's there to begin with I don't know to zoom in on it.This lens is well worth the money spent.  For a beginner you can't beat the price or value it has when it comes to familiarizing yourself with the camera.  I feel this was a great investment.  It works terrific during the day and I have some amazing photos of my boys playing baseball that were previously impossible with point and click cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1367107200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2013"}
