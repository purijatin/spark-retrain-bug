I am still getting used to the camera and all the settings but even on auto mode the lens works very well. I am by no means a photographer but for my needs it is amazing. The lens easily attaches to the camera and comes with two caps for both sides of the lens to keep the dust out and protected when not in use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great addition for my cannon", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"}
