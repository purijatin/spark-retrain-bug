The stock 18-55mm was great for getting used to the camera. Now that I'm more comfortable with it, I needed something with some more range. This 75-300mm is fast focusing, clear and damn does it get out there!! I can now get awesome shots of things I wouldn't have even pulled the camera out for before. I love it! It takes great shots of the moon too which my original 18-55mm couldn't touch. It's the perfect upgrade from stock equipment.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great versatile lens!", "unixReviewTime": 1306022400, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2011"}
