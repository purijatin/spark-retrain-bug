Yes it is slow, and that is a problem when blowing up handheld shots.  A tripod is a necessity if you're concerned with shake.  On bright days though, I haven't had a problem with it.  The USM is good for quieter operation, though the focus can be slow in low contrast situations.Metal lens mount, and a sturdy feel are also nice features on this lens.  It's a great choice compared to the cheaper version, and for those of us who can't afford the more expensive, faster or IS models.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A nice thrifty choice.", "unixReviewTime": 1151971200, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2006"}
