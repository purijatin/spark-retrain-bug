With $169 I can take some nice nature and sports pictures. If I ever learn more it will be worth inxesting to what is advertised as a better lens of this type. The particular lens is clear and brings things closer as described. No defects. I recommend it to anyone who wants to just bring themes closer without going pro or braking the bank.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does what it's supposed to do", "unixReviewTime": 1377993600, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2013"}
