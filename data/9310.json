This lens looks formidable compared to the stock lens. If you're shooting in daylight, you should be able to get some pretty good shots. The 1.6 crop factor on the Digital Rebel XT effectively turns this into a 120-480 35mm equivalent. Can't beat that for the price.Unfortunately, the rather small aperture of f/5.6 at 300mm means this lens can't be used in low, or maybe even low-medium light. Several pictures shot at 300mm in the evening came out very blurry - f/5.6 just didn't let enough light in. Earlier today, in a dimly lit auditorium (1 100w blub every 20ft or so), I could not get a sharp, properly exposed picture - it was either very sharp, very dark, or just enough light, but too blurry.I'm losing too many shots to low light. I suggest you look for a lens with a larger aperture - the EF 200m seems to fit this bill, but costs $600+, as well. But, I mean $150? What can I expect? The lens is a great value, just remember that it's a poor performer in low light.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Pretty slow.", "unixReviewTime": 1156204800, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2006"}
