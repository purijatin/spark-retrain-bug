This one is not terribly great. It tends to softness, particularly at the upper range, can show flare and CA, and the build quality is poor. In fact, after a couple years of use, the autofocus on mine stopped working, the only lens I've ever owned to have such a problem. I've seen similar reports on other photography forums so mine is certainly not an isolated problem. To repair it would cost almost as much as the lens itself, so it basically was trash at that point and I certainly was not getting another one and upgraded instead to the 70-300mm which is a far better lens all around. I'd suggest that anyone that needs a lens in the $200 or less range look at the latestSigma offering, which is a much better performer than this lens and gives you some decent macro capability as well, or the newCanon EF-S 55-250mm lens. While I've not tested this new lens myself, it's gotten very nice comments for the most part and IS in this price range is a real bonus.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not recommended, there are better lenses even in this price range.", "unixReviewTime": 1200355200, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2008"}
