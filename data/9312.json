I was using a 300mm prime, and he was using this lens..  the difference was amazing.  even I didn't think it could make that big of a difference going into a prime lens.  the image was easily 3 times the clarity and resolution on cropped images.now, don't fret, for the average point and shoot crowd, this will be a very nice step into the telephoto world, but if you are like many, you will be saving your change for the next lens after about 6 months.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "great value, but you will desire more shortly", "unixReviewTime": 1227916800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2008"}
