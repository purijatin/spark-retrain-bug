It lacks a fancy focus motor (i.e. USM), which makes it a bit slow and noisy, but you can't find a more inexpensive long distance telephoto lens.  It is perfect for the amateur photographer without a lot of money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A little slow, but worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1226361600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2008"}
