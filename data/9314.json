I am overall satisfied with it and  USM is a definite plus. However, do not expect astonishingly clear pictures from this lens! And you really have to use a tripod to get the most out of it. I do not carry this lens out most of the time in the camera bag because it is rather heavy. Buy it only if you need the zoom. I have experienced no mechanical or optical problems with this lens and therefore quite satisfied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Useful zoom lens", "unixReviewTime": 1039132800, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2002"}
