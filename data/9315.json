It is best in good lighting conditions, but you may have to fiddle with the aperture and ISO in low light. Then it will be grainy, anyway. And it won't really bring in the subject from very far away, but no 300mm will. So don't expect stunning nature photos or NASCAR photos from the cheap seats. The images I posted are from 50' away from the subject at most (Cedar Waxwings) and they have some grain even at ISO 100, but most people think they are decent enough. Anyway, it is a good way to get into a longer telephoto on the cheap. Enjoy, but understand its limitations.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Depends on your expertise and budget.", "unixReviewTime": 1170633600, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2007"}
