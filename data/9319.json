I purchased it at the same time as a Canon Rebel SL1 and so I was able to get this at a promo price making it an even better deal. 300mm allows for some tight close-ups but because it isn't an especially bright lens so it is best suited to bright outdoors. I haven't noticed any vignetting or chromatic aberrations; they are probably there but not to the point of being a bother. It would be difficult finding a lens in this focal length at a lower price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good \"kit\" Quality Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}
