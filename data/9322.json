Beyond 200mm it takes progressively more aperture reduction to get sharp photos.  Using f11 at 300mm gives excellent sharpness but then you need a tripod in all but very bright sunlight.  So, this lens will take sharp pictures but requires bright light or a tripod at the long end.The new 70-300mm IS version has a similar build quality and optics (maybe a tad better optics at the long end) and provides a 3-stop advantage which allows handholding under most conditions.  However, it costs over three times as much - but may be worth it to travel tripod-free.  I prefer the 70-200mm f4L which costs about the same as the IS version but produces even sharper images with eye-popping clarity and contrast - even wide open at f4 (no stopping down is needed at any focal length).  The L-lens is slightly larger, is off-white (gets noticed) and has no IS (but not needed unless it gets really dark since shooting at f4 gives better results than the IS lens at f8).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Lens for the Price if Stopped Down", "unixReviewTime": 1136764800, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2006"}
