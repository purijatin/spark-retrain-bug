Feels like a quality lens in hand and connects to my camera (rebel t3i) with no issues. If you are looking for an affordable lens that takes professional quality photos i would look here first!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this lens!", "unixReviewTime": 1360108800, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2013"}
