I by no means am anything but an amateur photographer at this point, and with that said, this lens has been great for me....  I don't care that it's noisier than the included 18-55 lens, and I've taken some fantastic fully zoomed in pictures with this lens, I have seen no indication of unfocused results...  If you're a \"pro\" and you are buying a $150 lens and expecting $800 results, you might want to revisit your expectations  :-)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This lens has been perfect for me", "unixReviewTime": 1266710400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2010"}
