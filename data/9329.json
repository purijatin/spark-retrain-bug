Sure this isn't a professional lens, but for us advanced amateurs it offers all the versatility at a very affordable price.  My only problems with this lens is that focus tends to be slow and the barrel is a little stiff.  I'd still highly recommend it though.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great lens with few problems", "unixReviewTime": 972432000, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2000"}
