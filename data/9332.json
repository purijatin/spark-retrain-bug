While getting a telephoto zoom lens was better than not having one, I really disliked this lens other than the price and extended range.Pros:- Greatly extended lens vs the xs' kit lens (18-55mm)Cons:- No Image Stabilization meant using a tripod, tree, table, etc. all of the time- Very few shots were extremely sharp in less than ideal conditions (worked great on a sunny beach boardwalk and that's it)- Not a lot of saturation or contrast in the image colorsIf you are using one of the APS-C sensor Canon SLRs (Rebel Series), it's only +$70 to get theCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras.  In the world of SLR photography, $70 is nothing.  You'll get IS, which will give you much better images (sharper, better colors, etc), and it's my guess that the lens optics are much better, too.  The only downside of this lens is that you wouldn't be able to move it to one of the full frame SLRs in the future.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Only good if this is all you can afford", "unixReviewTime": 1282435200, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2010"}
