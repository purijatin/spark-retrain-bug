Went out and took some photos with it just to see what it would do.  I was expecting to see some blurring since I had read the reviews and that seemed to be the biggest con on this lens. Well, I am truely surprised. I do not have a tripod yet so I braced my elbows on the front porch.  I still knew that I was moving the lens around as I took a picture.  But the photos came out excellent.  I am using a Canon Rebel XTI. I am very happy I bought the lens.  I am just an amatuer photographer but the lens did all and more than I wanted from it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great lens for the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1180137600, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2007"}
