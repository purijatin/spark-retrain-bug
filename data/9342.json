We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets.  We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great! -This lens took action shots.", "unixReviewTime": 1214697600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2008"}
