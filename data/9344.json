Chromatic Aberrations - the 75-300 has a lot of it, the 55-250 not so much.2. size - the 75-300 is a big lens, not really easy to work with. The focal length is also a bit weird, the 55-250 is perfect for crop sensor cameras.3. IS - the 75-300 doesn't have it, the 55-250 does. At long focal lengths IS is a must.I use my 55-250 for portraits and wildlife, and I had used the 75-300 for wildlife/macro, and honestly, if you know how to use the lens it will work well, the only thing that got me away from it was the color fringing (aberrations) when doing macro.Should you buy it? if you have the extra cash, get the 55-250 IS. If not, you can buy this and you should be happy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Lens, not great though.", "unixReviewTime": 1309996800, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2011"}
