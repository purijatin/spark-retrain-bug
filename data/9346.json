Great lens for action, sports, or wildlife.  You can also create great depth with this one.  Wish the aperture would open up to 3 at least.  I shot hockey for an assignment and really had a tough time, I got my shots, but I could've gotten more with a larger ap.  Will upgrade on this in the next couple years.
