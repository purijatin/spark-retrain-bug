It's a great value and is the typical solid Canon quality that I expected. Pleas keep in mind this lens does NOT have IS (Image Stabilization) so it can be tricky to get clear shots without use of a tripod. This is a great lens to add to your Canon Camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great price for a Great Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1293235200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2010"}
