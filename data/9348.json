This is not a lens to capture car races.Used outdoors in sunlight, this lens is quite acceptable. Do you want to take a photo of your child at bat in a day baseball game?This lens will meet your needs at $1,000 less than an 'L' quality lens.If you didn't understand what I mentioned about color aberration, and you don't use manual focus tweaking, and you don't want to 'freeze frame' fast motion, and you don't have a creative effect in mind that requires the lens open more than f5.6, this lens is a very cost effective lens.As a final note, while I own other Canon lenses that cost about 10 times as much as this lens, I am keeping this lens with a complete understanding of the limits of when I may use the lens effectively.It is a great value for the money!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A good lens when limits are understood", "unixReviewTime": 1293062400, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2010"}
