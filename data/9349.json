I have used this lense about 4 times.  I like the reach but that's about it.Sorry but this lense just doesn't do it for me as the focus is slow and the images are just not sharp.  Honestly if you want something I would suggest the 70-300 usm or even the 70-200 f/4 L.  The build quality on this lense is cheap.  The focus ring is small (obviously most of the users will be using autofocus anyways).  The filter does move whenever you focus (not good).  There is no image stabilization either.I wouldn't recommend this lense unless it was pretty much free.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not bad for a novice user", "unixReviewTime": 1289088000, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2010"}
