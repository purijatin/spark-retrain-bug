Now that I have been using it for about a year and have since learned a little more about photography, I kind of wish that I had bought the IS version or maybe even one of the higher quality (and much more expensive) L versions. I'm no pro but even I can tell that it becomes pretty soft at the long end. Plus the front element rotates which can be a problem when using a circular polarizing filter. As mentioned in other reviews, the use of a tripod can go a long way in helping to minimize the need for IS but a tripod is not always practical. Plus, when I bought it, I didn't anticipate that I would use it as frequently as I have (though I still use my regular zoom more often). But despite its weaknesses, it's still a pretty good lens, especially for the money. It has allowed me to get many shots I would not have been able to get otherwise, and with decent image quality. If you're truly budget-minded and just want the extra reach for fun, then this would be a good choice. However, if your serious (or plan to be), and can afford it, I would go with something a little higher quality.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price, but.....", "unixReviewTime": 1182297600, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2007"}
