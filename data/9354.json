Poor focusing and lots of hunting for focus on my Digital Rebel.  Slowness made every shot underexposed.  Lens mounted to the camera losely, so you could wiggle the lens.  Lens gave error 99's on the EOS.Avoid this product.Update:  Purchased the Canon EF 75-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens and it is absolutely wonderful.  Worth the extra money for better glass, Image stabilization, and faster focusing.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Just awful.
