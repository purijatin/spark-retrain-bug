Lovely", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I have this slot in my Canon 60D which states it is for a HDMI cable that can be hooked up to a HDTV.  It is supposed to provide a sharper picture so I thought I would get one.  Canon wants $50+ for the cable - no thanks.  On Amazon I found a cable for less than $4.00 - can you believe that?  It works great.  Sorry, Canon, but I have found the price of all your accessories way out of line.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Canon Mini HDMI cable", "unixReviewTime": 1349827200, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2012"}
