It won't focus sharply when the aperture is wide open, so it's hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject.  Its high f-number means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake, and forget about action shots unless it's full sunlight.  It also has very bad chromatic aberration; this may be corrected by a UV filter, but I haven't tried it.  It shows purple halos around dark objects when they're set against a bright background.The lens does have very nice autofocus, though.  It's very fast, especially after it's found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shots.Overall, this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens, but its quality is low and it's not good for much more than learning.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Worth every penny", "unixReviewTime": 1174521600, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2007"}
