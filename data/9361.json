I am not a fan of the auto focus mechanism, but otherwise it is perfect. The zoom is deep enough for all kinds of fields/ action shots. It's small enough to not weigh down a neck strap or bag, but does everything I need it to do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect sports starter lens", "unixReviewTime": 1395619200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2014"}
