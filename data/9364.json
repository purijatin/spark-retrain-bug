Which if you use adobe light room can be fixed.  Sharpness is good though even at 300mm. Which is more than I can say for the $400 Nikkor 55-300 vr that I bought for my Nikon camera!  If you have a little time to invest in photo editing this lens does just fine!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good lens", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}
