And I absolutely love it right now. I don't know about all the technical specs and so on, all I care is that it take awesome pics, and I have primarily been using it outside, taking pics of animals and objects. I read all the reviews about the lens, from the 5-star to the 1-star (I don't know if anyone would have given it a no-star rating if possible haha) and decided to try it for myself. And I am very pleased I got it, it's a major step up from my Nikon L100 point and shoot camera. But otherwise, I would recommend this lens to others if they are getting a Canon DSLR. Shipping was so damn fast, I had done two-day shipping but got it the very next morning before I even woke up. I woke up, checked the delivery status and it was right outside my door. I had ordered it the day before in the afternoon.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very good lens kit.", "unixReviewTime": 1307491200, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2011"}
