It's not an expensive lens to begin with, so it wasn't very quick with the \"auto-focus.\"  I was also new to using the \"action\" setting, which takes 3 to 4 frames per second when you hold down the shutter button.  So while several of my shots were slightly blurry, I did notice that it did a good job trying to \"follow\" the subject.I was shooting a basketball game, and trying to focus on one player in particular.  When I would slightly depress the shutter, I noticed that a rectangle would show up around my subject, and follow him as long as he was in the \"frame.\"  That was pretty cool.  It sort of \"knew\" who I was trying to focus on. Several shots came out well.  I need more practice.A 300mm zoom isn't tremendous, but it does make things a few times larger than \"naked eye\" size.I was pleased with the automatic exposure.Don't try to focus on anything closer than 5 feet when using this lens.Overall, I was very pleased with this lens!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great!", "unixReviewTime": 1355184000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2012"}
