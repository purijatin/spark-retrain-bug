Banker", "helpful": [0, 2], "reviewtext": "I've spent days looking online for a lense like this and finally went to Amazon.com. After a short minute or two, this deal came along and I jumped on it. The seller advertised the lense as like new, and boy was it ever. I was pleasently surprised upon opening the shipping box and discovering the lense was in perfect condition. I feel I made a very smart choice by using Amazon.com. I saved almost half the store cost on this item. From now on, I will always shop with Amazon before looking at the online auction services...Thanks!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Deal on Camera Lense", "unixReviewTime": 1245715200, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2009"}
