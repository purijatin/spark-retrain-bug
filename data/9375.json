If you just want to take some nice photos or scenery or people this is a great lens.  Took a bunch of photos with it already and the DOF is great and the colors are great.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quick update to a stock DSLR Camera.  My skill level is intermediate and I am no pro, but if you want to take some good pictures and on a tight budget, this is a great lens!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this lens", "unixReviewTime": 1353024000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012"}
