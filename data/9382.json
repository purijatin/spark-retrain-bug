So far it works fine and the pictures and zoom application are as expected.  The only down point was that the shipment took forever 3 plus weeks to arrive.  It was not the fault of the vendor but rather the carrier.  I would and will buy more products from this vendor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I like it", "unixReviewTime": 1232928000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2009"}
