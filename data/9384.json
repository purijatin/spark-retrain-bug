It's a bit long so it's not ideal for a walk around lens...but MAN, oh man does it capture some amazing shots. I first tried it out on a windy day at the lake with my nieces and nephews and caught some absolutely amazing shots. The clarity of the images even at full zoom is incredible, and don't even get me started on the bokeh! It is just a wonderful lens...now if Canon would only make it a bit more squat, it would be perfect!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1222905600, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2008"}
