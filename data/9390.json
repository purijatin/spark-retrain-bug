The zoom is very satisfying...buildings a mile away become a useable size.  I'll just break it down into pros and cons.PRO- Smooth focus and zoom irises.PRO- Good image quality for most of the lens' range.PRO- AffordablePRO- Provides great zoom ability (75-300), \"completes\" the kit lens (18-55).CON- Autofocus is kinda slowCON- F-stop requires a lot of light when zoomed in around 300mm.  This would be true of any lens, though.CON- Images might not be that clean when zoomed in around 300mm.  This could be due to the increased gain or shutter speed, but in general I found I had to work a lot harder to get a crisp, sharp image when I zoomed in at 300mm (again, could be true of any lens, but this is the only one I know).Ultimately, I'm really glad I got it.  I'm guessing other lenses are better because they cost more, but I can't comment on those.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for someone who doesn't know better", "unixReviewTime": 1320105600, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2011"}
