After reading his review, I purchased it.  I have had it for a few days now, and I am very happy with it.  I have not found any focus problems.  It acts exactly like my Canon 55-250mm Telephoto lens.  Most of my shots (about 99%) are Nature and Landscape.  Every now and then I photograph my grandchildren playing sports.  My first test of the lens was shooting birds in my backyard.  They do not sit still very long, so I was constantly focusing and refocusing, and it was fast enough for me.  I see no difference at all with the operation of this lens and my Canon 55-250mm.  The only thing it does lack is Image Stabilization.  I found myself turning the Image Stabilized button off for most shots with my 55-250mm, and I always use a tripod anyway, so it is not needed for me.Thank you John, I would not have purchased this lens had it not been for your review.By the way, I was able to sell my used 55-250mm on ebay for $107 minus $9 shipping & insurance costs (sold in a few hours), so I figure this lens cost me about $30.oo Net!I absolutely love this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost Did Not Buy Because of Negative Reviews.", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013"}
