One thing I had learned in the 20 some years of buying equipment was that the Minolta Brand was better quality, and higher priced. When I decided to go Digital, I did endless hours of research on the camera. I chose to get the Canon 20d over a similar Nikon. So far, so good. When it came time to add accessories, I did next to no homework. I bought this lens at a local camera chain store. It was affordable, and had the Canon name on it. In about three weeks time, I dropped the lens while making a lens change at a soccer game. It stopped working. No one cared, because I had dropped it. My Minolta gear has most certainly been banged, bruised, dropped.... It ranges in age from 10 years old to stuff handed down to me from my father over 20 years ago. It all still works. I have since upgraded to the \"L\" series lens. I wish a salesperson at the store had taken a moment to explain that Canon does, in fact, produce some crap. My \"L\" series lens is awesome, and I would highly recommend that anyone considering this lens, wait until you can afford the \"L\" series lens. This lens is sure to disappoint.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poor quality", "unixReviewTime": 1127174400, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2005"}
