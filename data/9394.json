The build quality isn't the issue. If you test the flash out you will almost be blinded by the bright light. BUT for some reason the flash doesn't seem to ever die. This means after 3-4 rolls of film the flash dims to the point where it starts to make the pix under exposed to the point of being not fixable. So every 100-120 exposures replace all 4 AA batteries. The old batteries will still be usable in lower power electronics so don't toss them out.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "380ex is great as a fill flash", "unixReviewTime": 1282608000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2010"}
