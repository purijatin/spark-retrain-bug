E-TTL works very well for off-centered subjects. High speed sync works for all shutter speed from 1/125 to 1/4000s, making fill flash very easy. Also, 2nd curtain sync provides very creative control in night photographyThere's not a whole lot to say in a review about a flash. There are better flashes for more money and flashes with less features for less money. I bought this flash to replace the onboard flash of my Elan IIE. It greatly outperforms the flash on the camera body. Also, if you use larger diameter lenses like the Canon 28-135mm, the flash on the camera body is slightly obscured by the lens itself. The 380EX is an ideal mid level flash for the Canon EOS system. If you're trying to learn more about flash photography and want to experiment, you can't do much because it's totally automatic. The higher level model (420EX, 550EX) offer many for features for a price.Thanks for your time...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great mid level flash for the EOS system", "unixReviewTime": 1009670400, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2001"}
