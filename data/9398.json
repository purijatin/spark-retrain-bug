Had some test shots with my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. After you turn on the Camera and the 380EX mounted on it, it does show the E-TTL indicator. As per my camera documentation mine is a Type-A camera. I followed all the steps in the 380EX manual as well as my XTi manual. Looks like the best results are with either Av (Aperture priority) or Tv (Shutter Priority). I think setting the Aperture as wide as you can (In Av Mode) and letting the camera choose the best shutter speed works best for me. I have tested with ISO 800. May be i am missing something, but the performance of the speedlite does not seem to be any better than the in-built flash. I struggled a lot trying to make the speedlite work in AUTO mode, No luck, It just won't sync with the shutter. May be i need to test more settings and see what i am missing.Update: Found it best fit if used as fill flash.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Using 380EX with my Rebel XTi", "unixReviewTime": 1301788800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2011"}
