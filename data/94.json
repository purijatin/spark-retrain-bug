I think this weights more than the 26\" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid Design - Adjustable", "unixReviewTime": 1311552000, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2011"}
