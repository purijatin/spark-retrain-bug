I received a pair of the Canon Image  Stabilization Binoculars as a gift from a friend and was immediately blown  away by how well they work.  The fact that they don't shake makes it  possible to read numbers and signs at great distances.  I race on sailboats  and the ability to read call letters and names on competitive boats is a  real help.  I also got the clearest view of the moon I have ever seen last  night.  The large lenses really capture a lot of light, so that you can see  clearly at night as well.  They are pricey, but you really get you money's  worth with this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Oh.....My.....God!", "unixReviewTime": 968284800, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2000"}
