They are outstanding, even without using the image stabilization.  It's remarkable to experience how jitter vanishes when the stabilization is engaged: the moons of Jupiter pop out, and central peaks within large lunar craters are easy to see.The most interesting effect of the image stabilization occurs in dynamic scenes, where bushes or trees may be moving in the wind (and perhaps a bird or other creature hidden there as well).  Without the stabilization, jitter makes it impossible to identify details in such scenes.  The stabilization function really reveals much in such instances, since the observer's random motions are canceled out.The quality of construction is excellent; the focus mechanism is silky smooth, and has a considerable range; the field of view is very good; and the optical correction is outstandingly sharp over the entire field.Buy a couple of snap-in 58 mm lens caps to protect the front optics, you don't need anything else; Canon E-58U caps(for about $8.50) work fine.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beautiful Optics, Excellent Performance", "unixReviewTime": 1259280000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2009"}
