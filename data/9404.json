The 15x50 IS Binoculars are no exception. I have used mine for the past five years with much pleasure. My wife uses a Canon 40D camera along with an assortment of Canon lenses (I just got her an EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM for Christmas). We have several 'point and shoot' Powershots floating around. I will continue to purchase Canon products into the future with expectations that they will continue to lead their industry as they are doing now.Now let me tell you about Canon's repair service... It is terrible... All which prevents it from being the MOST terrible is the fact that some of the other companies are worse, but this is no excuse for a world leader in its field -- as Canon certainly is -- to offer less than excellent service.Banzai Canon!! Wake up and smell the tea!Eric Rall", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "CANON; The products and the service.", "unixReviewTime": 1197936000, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2007"}
