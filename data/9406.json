We stood at the window of our 24th floor office and read the menu of a hot-dog cart on a corner a block and a half away.What really clinches it (and made it possible to read the hot-dog cart menu) is the image stabilization. If you have a high magnification, any minor shake of your hand is magnified.  Try it with a video camera with one of thos high digital zooms.  When you're at 100x, even the electronic image stabilization can't compensate just for the average minor muscle twitches in your hand.The image stabilization on this is optical (i.e. analog), not digital, meaning there's no fuzzing of the image as a processor tries to adjust the image to compensate for vibration. Optical zoom and optical stabilization require more expensive mechanical components to implement, thus you'll see mid-range video cameras offering their digital counterparts to enhance or substitute for optical zooms and stabilizers.Given, these binoculars will set you back a pretty penny, but you could go to a ball game, sit in the nosebleeds and count the laces on the ball. Definitely a very cool thing for the gadget-oriented.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost a hand-held telescope", "unixReviewTime": 968198400, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2000"}
