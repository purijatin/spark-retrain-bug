They're durable and the image stabilization is fantastic (and necessary at that magnification).  Yes, they're heavy - but what do you expect at 15x50!  We did have the battery door break this year and sent them in for repair.  Came back with \"no charge\" even though well out of warranty.  The only drawback is that the price keeps going up over the years as the Dollar falls against the Yen.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "None better!", "unixReviewTime": 1325548800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2012"}
