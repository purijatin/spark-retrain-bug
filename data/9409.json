I also have the Canon 8x25 IS, 10x42L IS WP and 12x36 IS II's that are all the best in their class. The 15x50 IS is at the limit of the Canon IS system because the 18x50 with 0.7 correction angle would make it alot harder to stay within that amount for the average person IMHO. I could track planes very easy with my 10x42L's but my 12x36's and 15x50's are too hard to stay within the correction angle while panning but for everything else they are great. For half the price of premium 15x binoculars the 15x50 IS's are a bargain and have wider FOV with a steady view to see detail that could not be seen in 15x non IS premium binoculars handheld.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best high powered binoculars for handheld use.", "unixReviewTime": 1170892800, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2007"}
