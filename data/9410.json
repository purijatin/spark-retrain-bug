The 5-minute timer for the IS system is much better than the earlier version on my father's set of Canon IS binoculars.  This is my first set of \"real\" binoculars, as I don't count the el-cheapo set I've had for football games.  I was very impressed with the amount of light these allow in, making the image very clear.  The amount of detail you can see with the IS system truly is amazing - I'm not sure that going back to regular binoculars is a possibiliy now.The only cons I can think of are the lenscaps - for $900, you'd think that Canon could figure a way to make a more substantial cap that clips on the body - I am going to try to find an aftermarket solution, because these just don't cut it.A great set of binoculars for hunting, bird-watching, backyard astronomy, wildlife, etc.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just as I expected...", "unixReviewTime": 1136160000, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2006"}
