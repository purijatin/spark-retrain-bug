Best binoculars I have ever used.  I have used regular 18x50 binoculars in the past and always found it challenging to hold the image steady watching sporting events. The stabilization feature is terrific.  The rock solid image is definitely worth the cost.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}
