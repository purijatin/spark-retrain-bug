They have served me very well for general, light use in the following areas:- birdwatching- moon/sky-gazing, but you don't want a bulky telescope- any other time I needed to magnify my view with a steady imageI wanted to be able to look at the moon, but was not interested on learning about, or moving around, a bulky telescope.  That is the main reason I ended up buying these binoculars.The image stabilization works superbly.For general use around your home, property, looking at the night sky, or trips where you can pack them in a suitcase to use at another destination, they are excellent.  They are on the heavy side, so probably not a good choice for backpackers.I have not tested them in \"all weather\", so I cannot comment on that feature.  In my opinion, they are so nice, and expensive, I only take them out of the original box for use in good weather, then I put them right back into the box for safe-keeping.  But, they do feel tough and rugged.The IS is worth the extra cost in my opinion.  It will make an otherwise shaky magnified image almost perfectly steady - truly amazing!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love these binoculars!", "unixReviewTime": 1280275200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2010"}
