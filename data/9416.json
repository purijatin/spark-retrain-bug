As some of the other reviews have pointed out, they can pull in the moons of Jupiter quite well, among other items.  Perhaps the most impressive feature is how well the image stabilization works-- no need of a tripod even at 18x magnification.The only 'cons' I can think of might be price, and perhaps field-of-view (if you want to sweep large areas of sky).  I think the weight is reasonable for the degree of magnification that is offered.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1237680000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2009"}
