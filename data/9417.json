Canon has long enjoyed a reputation for top-quality consumer optics, and this binocular certainly performs up to that standard. The image stabilization makes magnification over 10x practical for handheld viewing, and is very intuitive in use: one push of the IS button to activate, another to deactivate. I was somewhat skeptical that the 15x50 would perform well at night for stargazing. The 3.33mm exit pupil seemed to be too small for astronomy, but I didn't need to be concerned. The large 50mm objective lenses gather plenty of light. This, combined with the 15x magnification and very effective stabilization system, makes it a wonderful astronomy instrument. My backyard telescope has remained under wraps for months, because the Canon is so much handier to use, with zero set-up time.For daytime use, the images are bright, well defined, with no discernable chromatic aberration. For bird watchers, this bino may be a bit too bulky and heavy for comfort when hiking through the back country. I found that a larger padded neck strap goes a long way towards relieving that problem, though.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent For Daytime And Astronomy", "unixReviewTime": 1177200000, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2007"}
