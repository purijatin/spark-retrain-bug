But the IS allows me to look through these as long as I can support them.  Like another reviewer, I find I have to fold down the eye cups for a better view.I fail to understand why Canon can't include a cover for the objective lenses, particularly at this price tag.  Aside from that, the only complaint worth mentioning is that they are rather heavy, and you won't be pointing these at the sky for too long without a tripod or something supporting your elbows.If you can afford them and don't mind a little weight, you will be pleased.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "IS makes a world of difference!", "unixReviewTime": 1168041600, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2007"}
