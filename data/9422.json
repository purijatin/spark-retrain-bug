Either the eyecups will hopefully soften up, or I will get callouses on the bridge of my nose.  Super stiff, and too large a diameter eyecups. Come on Canon... don't you listen to the feedback of all the people complaining about the eyecups on these?The image stabilization is nice, makes a big difference, too bad I am also focusing on the pain from the eyecups.I went into this purchase knowing the eyecups and eye-relief issues were there... so I am hoping to figure someway to improve on this. I did find some websites that show different ways to improve/replace these eyecups, nothing too easy though since it appears that the eyecups are mounted quasi-permanently to the binoculars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Eye Cups are TERRIBLE....", "unixReviewTime": 1312502400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2011"}
