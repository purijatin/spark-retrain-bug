It's a real work-horse.It's very \"plastic\" compared to the more costly lenses, but that also keeps it very light. Because it's so light, I tend to lug it around more than I would if it were a more quality/heavy lens. So for the price, it gets the job done. Don't listen to the lens snobs that put it down. I've taked some outstanding photos with this lens, and yes... even at full zoom. And they talk about the poor build quality? False. Yes, it's plastic and cheap. But it's built well. Mine is over five years old and well traveled. Works perfectly!!!UPDATE: today (Oct. 30, 2007) I tested this lens. I took photos of moving vehicles on an interestate and they came out crisp and clear at full zoom (200mm). I also took some photos of a cat outside, and they also turned out great at full zoom. For the cost of this lens, it can't be beat!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Little Zoom Lens (extremely light)!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1193270400, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2007"}
