It is a decent lens for the price and an excellent starter lens. I bought this lens when I made the step up to SLR with my 10D. It takes some decent pictures. Not stunningly sharp, yet usable for a number of tasks. I'm not so sure about action shots yet, though. The main test I had with it was a volleyball game my wife was coaching. I rattled off 100 shots with this lens, and got about 15 that I was happy with. I haven't really used it since then based on this. I've learned more things to help my photography in this situation, and I have learned that I probably wasn't using the correct focus drive for the situation. That most likely accounts for the vast majority of shots I didn't care for. Even though I now know this, I somehow associate this lens with my disappointment with those shots. I've since upgraded to an older 70-210 push-pull zoom lens that I like a lot better. I may sell this lens, but I'll give it another shot before I do that. Aside from that, the build quality is good for the price, and it is fairly lightweight for the zoom you get with it. It's not a terribly fast lens apeture-wise, but it seems to work well enough. I don't think you can get a better zoom lens for the price, so I can't knock it too much! Overall, you'd be wise to start off with a zoom like this one and work from there. It's a great starting block lens!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Middle of the road lens...", "unixReviewTime": 1197504000, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2007"}
