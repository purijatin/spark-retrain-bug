It lasted me a long time, especially when you drop a tele-convertor into the mix.  It is most definately an amateur lens.  Don't expect poster sharp results.  But then, look at the price.  You get what you pay for and for what you pay for this lens you get a great deal.  I've since upgraded to a 75-300 and passed this lens on to a friend who also loves it.  If you can afford the extra (about ($) more) I'd recommend the 75-300 for extra range.  If not, I've no complaints about this lens.As an added bonus, if you get the other 'starter' lens, the 35-80, the filter screw size is the same so you'll need to buy fewer filters as they will be usable on both lenses.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good starter zoom at a great price", "unixReviewTime": 972950400, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2000"}
