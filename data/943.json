I bought this to be used during a short film production. It worked about 60% of the time. It would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor. Haven't tested on other monitor as we were to busy working, but this cable negatively affected my production having to wait to start rolling as we didn't have an image.I will like be returning this product. You get what you pay for.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Premium Canon Mini HDMI", "unixReviewTime": 1286582400, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2010"}
