Admittedly I wasn't very impressed at first, but with addition of a sigma UV filter my pictures at 200mm are now clearer and a truer reflection of the subject. At 200 the pictures tend to be a bit soft, but it's noticeable unless you do some serious cropping. With this lens I also prefer to shoot with auto zoom instead of manual zoom.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Canon EF80-200mm f4.5-5.6 II", "unixReviewTime": 1336521600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2012"}
