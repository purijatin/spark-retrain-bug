This is a fantastic lens for what you pay. It is indeed a light light lens and it almost feels \"cheap,\" but it functions great and takes great shots. When focusing manually, it doesn't feel as smooth as some other lenses. But you really can't go wrong with this lens.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perspective of a casual photographer", "unixReviewTime": 1110499200, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2005"}
