With two 550ex's one will work as a master and one as a slave and with the ST-E2 both flashes can be off camera and fired E-TTL.  The draw backs are: price, no manual control in slave mode for greater light control, and size (this thing is big).  The plus side weighs out the negatives.  It is a great flash.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wireless E-TTL", "unixReviewTime": 1111622400, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2005"}
