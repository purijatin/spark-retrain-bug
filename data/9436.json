This is my first off camera flash.My budget is very limited and was unsure about using the 550ex.Turns out the 550ex is a very good flash and similar to the 580ex, with predictably fewer features. It serves as both a Master, Slave, and Wireless; ETTL works, too.Considering the cost of the 430ex and 580ex, a 550ex is a good economic choice; most of their features at about  to &#8531; the cost. For a tight budget and an entry Pro level Speedlite i like it, and it fully functions with the t3i.The one i bought was used (since it is out of production), yet, works well. I'm learning how to apply off camera flash to my skills.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Speedlite  Prior Model and alot like its successor the 580ex.", "unixReviewTime": 1402704000, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2014"}
