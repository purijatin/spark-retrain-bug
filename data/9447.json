You can't believe the dust, dirt, and grime that sticks to your lens. Once, I accidently focused on the dirt so the picture showed all the dirt... it was amazing! If you want better pictures, you need to start with a cleaner lens.The brush is great, and the smudge remover really does work. I don't understand how it works, because if you touch the smudge remover to your skin, it leaves a black residue. I have no troubel with black smudges on my lens after using it. I don't know how, but it works!Must have for all!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great!", "unixReviewTime": 1185148800, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2007"}
