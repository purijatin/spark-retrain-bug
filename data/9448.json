I was sold this exact Sima lens pen, it worked so well on all the cameras I decided to try it on my glasses. Boy was I amazed, I did'nt believe how clean and sharp my glasses became after using lens pen on my glasses. I was so amazed I purchased another Sima lens pen from amazon.com just for my glasses and I carry it with me whenever I leave home. I touched the tip and it left a black mark on my hand, whatever it is, it works. I highly recommend the Sima lens pen cleaning tool. I'll probably purchase 1 or 2 more of these, if you need this type of product, purchase this one it works greatly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This thing works better than expected.", "unixReviewTime": 1287619200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2010"}
