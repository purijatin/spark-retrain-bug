Hill \"CFH\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "What a workhorse, we bought the Oly C-3000z around the end of 2000 and, until very recently, have used it at least a few times a week (almost every week) in our shop for product pictures. With a resolution of 3.2mp, this camera takes pictures that are still good for web pages and most advertising flyers and prints we produce.It might seem odd to be writing a review for a camera this old, but we are about to retire this one from the shop (replacing it withFujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Triple Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD) and give it to one of my kids as a beater camera. I noticed that several of these cameras were being sold on Amazon as used (but not by me), and wanted to let people know that it is possible for there to be \"life\" in a camera this old.Here are my general observations (+/-):+ Good Lens - 3x Optical Zoom- Shows \"Purple Fringing\" in some cases+ Good Solid Body - Feels good in the hand- Bad Lens Cap - Replaced mine with a 3rd party one that is no longer made+ Good Movie Mode w/Sound - A nice feature when this camera was made- Uses SmartMedia Cards - Fairly low capacity, getting harder to find, and many computers require usb adapters to read them+ Great Macro Mode - Very good for our product pictures+ Remote Control - Suports a remote control, which is important for tripod shots in low lightWe have taken 1000s of pictures with this camera, including two award winning photos, and it likely will take many more.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Going On 9 Years - Highly Recommended!", "unixReviewTime": 1253232000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2009"}
