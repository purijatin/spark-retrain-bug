Mullen", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I have had this camera going on 6 years and it is still working strong and taking great picutres. Yes, there are newer cameras out there, but I still use this one. I replaced another brand digital camera in less than 6 months as it turned all pictures green with this model and no problems since. I got an all in 1 printer last year and my pictures download nicely to my computer with the HP printer software with no problems and I can also download family's newer pictures too (other olypmus cameras.)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "6 years and going", "unixReviewTime": 1164412800, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2006"}
