Wallach", "helpful": [57, 58], "reviewtext": "After having a great time with a cheaper digital camera - a Sony DSC-S30 1.3 Megapixel - I decided to trade up to one of the 3+ megapixel cameras.  I did extensive research comparing the top cameras, read countless reviews on photo websites, consumer reviews, etc.  The other cameras that I was seriously considering was the coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70.  I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a bargain.  If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography, the C3000 has almost as much as the 990.  It has manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual focus, and exposure bracketing to name a few.  But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well.  You get a rapid fire mode, which, though not blazingly fast, is still respectable and even increases quite a bit with focus set to manual.  Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio clip, kind of an audio labeling.  There other cameras out there, notably the Cannon Powershot G1, which has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable for taking candid shots.  But the G1 has image problems(Chromatic Aberations and noise), as does the 990(redeye).  All these cameras have plusses and minuses, but with one of the top-rated images and top-rated feature-set with a price that's a couple hundred lower than most of the top cameras, the C3000 really stands out!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You can't get a better bargain right now.", "unixReviewTime": 976752000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2000"}
