There are some HDMI cables that have a very high price range, but this one has a really low price and it works great! I am using this cable on my Canon 600D/Rebel T3i. The T3i takes 18 Mega Pixel pictures and I can now see them on my HDTV. I played back HD video on it to and there was no lag what so ever. Personally, this cable seems to do just as great as those other more expensive brand cables. I would recommend this mini HDMI if you are going to be using it for your DSLR camera. 1080P Capable!I hope this review helped you out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works Perfectly!", "unixReviewTime": 1344902400, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2012"}
