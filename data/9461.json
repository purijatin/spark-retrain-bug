Excellent camera - sometimes need to \"touch up\" photos, but overall sturdy, great image quality and full of features. I am extremely satified with Olympus cameras - both film and digital (I also use Pentax film and Canon ELPH digital).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Workhorse!", "unixReviewTime": 1046304000, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2003"}
