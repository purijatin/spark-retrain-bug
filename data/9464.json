In its league it is by far the best digital camera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera's with the same resolution cost a lot more. This camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was disappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better than a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature.It has pretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you might find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as AMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money.This camera comes with the cables that let you connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a carrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are taking (which is a good thing !).You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer (make sure you've got a USB port in your pc and you've got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not work for you.It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay.I recommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a lot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You'll run out of this easily.There are other cameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply wonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger, the batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Pics !!!! Excellent Camera !", "unixReviewTime": 992131200, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2001"}
