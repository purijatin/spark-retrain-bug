That was 22 years ago.  In that time, I have had it serviced twice...  both times for a cleaning... and both times for around $25.  Not a bad service life.  My camera has been all over europe, spelunking, on mountains, snowmobiles, dive trips, and just about any other place electronic equipment is unsuitable.  It has never let me down.  It has photographed the births of both our children as well as a number of weddings.  I have reluctantly set aside my x700 for a new flashy Nikon which is lighter and digital... but there is NO way it could ever be half as durable as the Minolta.  It is built like a tank... it has the heft and quality feel of a good Maglite.  I also recommend dropping the cash and popping the MD1 motordrive unit on it.  You might as well.  Everything is availabe cheap these days.  It is still an impressive head turning unit in this configuration.  It has served me well for 22+ years... and I will keep it around for times when I am wary about the abuse a dSLR can handle.  My x700 has never \"crashed\" from being too cold, too hot, too rough. It never complains... and the pictures are always beautiful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One Tough Camera", "unixReviewTime": 1285804800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2010"}
