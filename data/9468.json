Crowley", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewtext": "Try to find a macro 24mm equivalent for your digital slr that focuses as close as 4\" and you will find there is no such thing.  So if you like the expansiveness of true wide angle, and want the ability to focus up close to get the incredible depth of field and frame-filling subject isolation that is achievable with a macro wide, then this is the body for you.  Then, all you have to do is find a used Sigma 24mm Macro manual focus lens and you have a low cost tool that can produce an image unlike any digital camera, even the most expensive and elaborate.The metering system in these Minolta bodies (there have been several very similar bodies over the last 20 years) is spot on, and shooting chromes is easy and sure.My only suggestion to those learning photography is to ditch the 50mm lens right away!  Get a wide - not a 28, but a 24 - and photograph the world like your eyes see it over a 90 degree field of view. You will be amazed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This camera has a secret advantage over any digital slr", "unixReviewTime": 1244937600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2009"}
