I tested this radio against my scanner. The antenna makes huge difference. CB radios are supposed to use whips. This is just the laws of physics. The rubber duckie included is no good. It may only work for the car in front or behind you.The bottom line is it's a portable low power CB radio. Let's set the expectations accordingly. If you don't care to have a CB specifically, but just need a radio to talk to your buddies on a trip, then there are better options.I can understand why it doesn't charge the batteries. I guess it would require an expensive circuit to charge 9 (yes, nine!) AAs. A separate charger or using disposable alkaline (lithium if this radio sits in your \"bug out bag\") batteries is the way to go.I'll do more testing to figure out the max distance I can get out of it in my area.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "ok portable cb", "unixReviewTime": 1369526400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2013"}
