I wanted to have a CB in the minivan so I could listen to truckers, learn about traffic problems, and hear about road conditions.  Also, I wanted a weather radio.  This unit had the features I desired.  It was quickly delivered and worked fine out-of-the-box.  I used the included 12v adapter and kept it powered up during the whole trip.  I used a roof mounted Cobra antenna (A1500) coupled to this radio via a BNC-to-Standard adapter.  Because I didn't know what language I'd hear over the CB, I also got a earphone/microphone combination that plugs into this handheld.  This setup worked great on the trip.  Range wasn't wonderful - probably about a mile or so.  But I did not have the equipment to set the SWR of the antenna so I wasn't too surprised. (An internal SWR meter would have earned this 5 stars.) Would I get it again?  Yes, the setup worked out fine for us.  Truckers could hear me fine (if within range) and I could hear them.  It was nice listening to weather radio also.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very functional hand-held CB", "unixReviewTime": 1168473600, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2007"}
