The idea was to put this in my car because I drive around a lot on the interstate and sometimes music just gets boring when you drive as much as I do.  I realize the antenna that comes with these is nothing to brag about, but I've picked up basically nothing but static from nearby transmissions by the time I squelch out the alternator whine in my car.  Maybe the truckers around here are just shy... The weather stations work fine, however.  I'm not going to give it an absolutely horrible rating because hey, it's a handheld CB.  They aren't exactly known for being awesome.  But for this price and brand name, I guess I expected a little better.  Maybe I just have bad luck with CBs, because I used to have an ancient hand-me-down Midland mounted in my truck with an 8 foot antenna and it didn't quite live up to my expectations either.This thing probably works much better if you're not in a car... I'm considering buying a small magnet-mounted external antenna and seeing if that helps.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Can't tell yet, I guess.", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}
