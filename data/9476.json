We have been using them for a week now and so far I am pleased.  However we ordered some off-brand lapel mic's that did not work so now we are going to try and get some Cobra Lapel mic's and hopefully they will work.  Only complaint would be that we need to wrap the bottom half of the radio with electrical tape to cover the power and charging port to protect them from dirt.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well for my excavating company.", "unixReviewTime": 1383955200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2013"}
