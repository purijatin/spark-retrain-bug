Venugopal", "helpful": [41, 44], "reviewtext": "This CB Radio is identical to the model sold as the \"HH Road Trip\". For a dollar more, the latter model also includes a magnetic rooftop antenna with coax cable. The radios are the same, down to the model number inside the package, the manual, and the FCC type certification.I think Amazon should tell users that the HH Road Trip includes an antenna for the same cost, and is the same product. Otherwise, they should reduce the price of this package to account for the lack of a magnetic mount antenna.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Identical to the ROAD TRIP model but lacks magnetic antenna", "unixReviewTime": 1266537600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2010"}
