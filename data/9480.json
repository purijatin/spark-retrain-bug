So for an upcoming trip to Wisconsin I purchased my first portable hand held unit. With the standard Rubber Duck antenna the reception inside the car is pretty bad, but using a Cobra conversion adapter I've connected my Wilson 1000 mag mount to the portable and reception and transmission is almost as good as my Ranger full size unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great with the right setup", "unixReviewTime": 1246060800, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2009"}
