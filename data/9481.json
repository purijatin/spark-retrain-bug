DUNTON \"mikedunton\"", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewtext": "I used this radio for a 4,000 mile road trip out west this past spring.  The radio worked very well when I took the time to learn all the features (and to efficiently use them).  If you use the car adapter to plug into your car's cigarette lighter it will give you some annoying humming that can drive you crazy if you let it.  I would highly recommend using this along with a car top antenna.  The range is decent and is very helpful on interstate travel.  The weather radio really helped prepare me for a springtime snowstorm when driving through Wyoming.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent for occasional road trip use", "unixReviewTime": 1184198400, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2007"}
