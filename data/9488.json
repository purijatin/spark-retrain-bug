I use this for 4 wheeling my Jeep & there is usually about 12-14 of us in a group back to back and I can only converse with those closest to me. I leave it on channel 19 on the HWY again can only hear those close by (usually right behind me or right in front).What is nice about this unit is that it can use batteries or you can plug it into your cigarette lighter (cord does come with it, but is hidden in the package, so be sure to find it before discarding the packaging. I've had mine since 2007 and use it 3-4/yr.Also, be careful of it falling over on the \"talk\" button. Thankfully we weren't talking about anyone when it happened to us!!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "40 feet maybe, not 4 miles", "unixReviewTime": 1317600000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2011"}
