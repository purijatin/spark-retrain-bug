There's not a thing I would change about it. While I catch some flack from friends for this, I actually use it in class to take notes, which proves to be very effective. They stop harassing me when I am able to just email them the notes of the class they miss. &lt;grin&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with a PDA.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "AWESOME! - &quot;Poor Man's Laptop!&quot;", "unixReviewTime": 1015545600, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2002"}
