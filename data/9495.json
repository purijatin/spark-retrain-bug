Paired with software that synced with my desktop word processor, I was able to easily take notes at meetings (having an almost full sized keyboard) and able to modify calendar entries etc with ease.  Prior to having the keyboard, I would usually take paper notes with the hope I would remember to put them on my desktop when I was home and later sync with the palm. It makes the palm much more useful.  Well worth the price", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy to use, makes a palm a laptop", "unixReviewTime": 1188345600, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2007"}
