The Stowawy's size--both in the full-size utility mode and the folded storage mode--far surpasses the GoType!  The Stowaway is about the same size as the Visor in the bifold case when folded for travel.  When  expanded, though, it really does become a full-sized keyboard with plenty  of Palm-specific options like &quot;Done,&quot; &quot;Cancel,&quot; and  &quot;OK&quot; keys.While it can be used on your lap, it does help to  have a firm surface under it.  I find it much sturdier than the GoType! and  do not worry about breaking it.  I'm more concerned about damaging my Visor  than I would ever be of damaging the Stowaway.While it doesn't have a  built-in HotSync ability like the GoType!, the point of having a keyboard  is to have rapid data entry away from your computer.  If you were at your  computer and could HotSync, you certainly wouldn't be using a smaller  keyboard like the GoType!'s.The Stowaway is certainly the best external  keyboard on the market, but at [the price], you really have to be committed to  being away from your computer and have the need to enter a lot of data  before the dividends offset the investment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic product, but at a price", "unixReviewTime": 963014400, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2000"}
