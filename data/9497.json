It basically turns your PDA into a compact laptop.  I use it for typing my schedule (with 3 kids and being a graduate student there is a lot of that!!!), typing my notes for class (and in class), making study guides, flashcards, etc.  I take it when we have to wait and my 6-year old uses it for letter recognition (so it's really sturdy).  I love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must have for any PDA", "unixReviewTime": 1026864000, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2002"}
