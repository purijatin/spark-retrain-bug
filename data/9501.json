The keyboard is pretty close to full size - much nicer for typing on than the  non-folding style keyboard (I forget who makes that one).One thing you  can't see from the picture is that it's not rigid at all - so it needs to  be placed on a flat surface for typing.  I'll post here again if I have  problems w/ it not lasting very long (due to it's flexibility) but I don't  expect it'll be a problem.How nice to have this sitting in my  briefcase - I'm much more spontaneous now w/ creating memos and emails  &quot;on the go.&quot;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Flexible, and Comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 959299200, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2000"}
