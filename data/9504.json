Though it is not practical for constant use, it is certainly the answer if you have large amounts of text to enter. (I would not jot down a phone number or address with it, but if I'm copying a recipe, taking notes, or writing e-mail, it's perfect.) Even though I have a great and small laptop, there are times when I want to be typing in thirty seconds and be done-and certainly not re-forming graffiti gaffes or trying to remember punctuation. The software is easy to install, and you get the hang of connecting it to your visor after a few times. It's particularly useful for third party applications that don't have a pc desktop interface; my checkbook program, for example, would otherwise have me do my week's collection of receipts with the stylus.For the keyboard-PRO: *Full size, comfortable, responsive; has a nice, faint clicking sensation. *Attaches easily. *Truly compact. *Some function keys. *Flawless (in my experience) integration with the rest of the machine-not glitchy and doesn't seem to drain the batteries. *Kinda slick to whip it out in a meeting room.CON: *It can't sit right on your lap, really. You have to put it on something flat.For the software-PRO: *Easy installation. *Some nice controls for repeat rate, etc. *Compatible with non-keyboard use of the Visor whenever you prefer. If it's in the keyboard, the machine knows it-use of the stylus is not at all compromised.CON: *You still have to use the stylus. You can't tab between fields, choose items from pop-up menus, scroll through lists, or other things those of us who are truly keyboard-dependent have come to expect.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 1023494400, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2002"}
