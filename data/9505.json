Bohlken", "helpful": [0, 2], "reviewtext": "My Targus Stowaway keyboard for Visor Deluxe seemed to have died over the weekend after eighteen months.  Actually, it was an internal conflict within the Visor.  I had added a jumper wire inside the Visor so I could charge from my hot synch. cradle after a corresponding modification to the cradle....  My Stowaway keyboard worked just like before after making this modification.  Then I downloaded Targus' lastest version of the driver for the keyboard.  A couple of days later the keyboard was completely non-responsive.  I have removed the jumper now.  I later found the real problem was that my Visor was in its final stages of life.  The keyboard does have a nasty habit of ceasing to communicate with my PDA. By experimentation, I learned that a soft reset followed by a warm reset got it going again. The keyboard works well when it works, but too often it does not.  Again, this is probably more of a problem with the Visor than the keyboard.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good as long as it works", "unixReviewTime": 1025654400, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2002"}
