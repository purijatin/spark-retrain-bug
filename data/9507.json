I have mine flopping around lose in my purse and it still works like a champ.Folded up, it's not much bigger than the Handspring in the leather case.Everytime I take out my keyboard in a meeting, at least one person in the meeting will say outloud, &quot;WOW... what is that thing, and where did you get it?!&quot;I've recommended it to a number of people who have bought their own and are thrilled with it.I can't say enough about how handy it is with taking notes.To take down a quick note, I'll still just use grafitti, but I've been in meetings where I've been asked to take minutes and I can't imagine having to do that w/ a stylus. No matter how fast you get w/ a stylus, it can't match the speed of typing.The keyboard stretches out to accommodate normal adult human hands which is a treat.My wish is that they come out w/ a new version that has a 10-key set as well... it would be a nice option for those who don't mind having one that's a little bigger. I'm always having to jot down IP addresses and other numeric data, and having to use the regular number buttons above the letters is a bit tedious. Otherwise, I highly recommend this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You've GOT TO HAVE THIS", "unixReviewTime": 997920000, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2001"}
