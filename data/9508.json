Oshiro", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "This is great for travelling, as I can stick my modem in the springboard slot and type quickly using an instant messenger. The keyboard seems rugged and folds to a very small unit, easily fits in a bag or briefcase. The price is kinda high, but worth it if you do a lot of travelling.After using it for 2 months, I noticed the keyboard would not work, so a quick power down and power up was required.  This happened to me several times.  It may get irritating if you use this keyboard a lot, but for me, it's a rarity to use it.Great for using on email!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very easy to use and fold, wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 991094400, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2001"}
