Baker \"...Steve\"", "helpful": [13, 13], "reviewtext": "ATTENTION BUSINESS TRAVELLERS: This unit works very well on an airplace service tray and folds up nicely when not in use. I hate bulky carry on bags and this combo can fit in your pockets!What else do I like about it?(1) Works perfect. Every time, no problems. Very reliable.(2) The keys feel good and it is easy to type fast.(3) Wow factor. This is an innovative device that expands whatyou can do with your Visor without comprimising portability.(4) Folds up nicely and tucks away in a sturdy outershell case.(5) Compatibility. This unit is compatible with every application I have I tried it with; games, business apps and word processors.The unit tri-folds and features an expanding keyboard track that allows you to click the keyboard into place once unfolded.It is easy to install. You load a driver onto your desktop, Hotsync it into your Visor and then connect the keyboard.There is a keyboard icon on your Visor that has an option to turn the keyboard on and off. At times I have had to reactivate the keyboard whenever I hook it up, but that only entails unchecking the activate box and then re-checking it.The keyboard has a slide out docking station that supports the visor from the back side.I bought my Visor to keep track of information and to access the web wirelessly. I quickly learned it was possible to access my spreadsheets and other Microsoft Office documents and be able to edit and save them on my Visor.That, of course, led to needing a keyboard. I am good at the graffiti, but nothing beats the keyboard when it comes to a lot of data entry. I now carry this combo wherever I might have brought a laptop and it works very well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Convert your palmtop Visor into a desktop: 5 Reasons to buy", "unixReviewTime": 1009065600, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2001"}
