The battery life is very short. So carry extra batteries, and any where there is vibration (Airplane, Train, etc.) you are out of luck unless you use one hand to hold everything still.

Mac / Palm users you need a pc and windows to make it work!!!!!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't waste your money", "unixReviewTime": 1094947200, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2004"}
