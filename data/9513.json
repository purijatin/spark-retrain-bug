The cable plugs directly into your computer's USB port and connects to the Visor's sync  port easily.Rated at 4 stars because I've had difficulty with my cable  disconnecting a few times if the Visor is moved during the sync operation.  If you do choose this product, be sure not to disturb the Visor while the  sync is in progress, to avoid any loss of communication.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handy way to sync without a cradle", "unixReviewTime": 961459200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2000"}
