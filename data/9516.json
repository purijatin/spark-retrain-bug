I use thisin conjunction with my HandSpring Back-up module.  I use the module when I'm away from a PC, and use this cable when I don't feel like carrying around a cradle with me all the time.  A must for the mobile elite.  =)My only recommendation would be for HandSpring to integrate this cable with a charger into one package.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Handspring Mobility at its best.", "unixReviewTime": 991440000, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2001"}
