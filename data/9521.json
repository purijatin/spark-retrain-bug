The only thing your likely to forget is to cycle your cable modems power so it can  grab the MAC address off of the router.  Some may have to call thier cable  modem vendor to change thier MAC address.My interest was not to  necessarily to add another PC on the net, but to protect my internal  infrastructure from the outside world and allow me to utilize TCP/IP for my  internal protocol, along with file sharing.If you don;t already have a  hub, grab the big brother version of this, which includeds four  ports.This thing does the trick.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really The Easiest Solution for Home Nets and Cable Modems", "unixReviewTime": 962582400, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2000"}
