My only quirk is that a little more documentation should be put in regarding setup where a server is involved. Everything looked like it was set up right but it wouldn't work. Fortunately a friend of mine was savvy enough to rig it up and make it run.That aside it is reliable. Once it was up and running I had no issues, save file transfer in AIM. (Workin' on that one)I'd recommend it for anyone who already has a network switch and doesn't want to replace it. If your going to start a network and share braodband, I'd go with the 4 or 8 port version. Those ports can run out fast.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for workgroups, little trickier with domains", "unixReviewTime": 1011139200, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2002"}
