Wright", "helpful": [8, 12], "reviewtext": "I do not know why this thing got all those great ratings; unfortunately I bought this on the strength of those reviews.  It seems great when you set it up, but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection VERY frequently.  If you have an always on broadband connection, don't get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the Internet.  It's certainly the cheapest thing out there; spend more and get something else!  Furthermore, Linksys tech support is non-existent; they do not respond.  I had decided to return this, only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now I am stuck with it.  I will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash.  By the way, the next model up (BEFSR14-4port) has the same problem (from what I have read of other reviews).  If you still want to take a chance, just save the box and the receipt!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "garbage", "unixReviewTime": 982454400, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2001"}
