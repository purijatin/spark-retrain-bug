I mean it.  This device is everything it is advertised to be and more.I had a ADSL line installed into my home in August.  Since that time I have attempted to get multi-computer access to the Internet via a multitude of methods.  I have attempted to setup a proxy server.  This method works but was difficult to setup and never seemed to work with all Internet based services.  I also spent 2 months trying to get a Cisco 675 router to work with ZERO success.  My frustration level continued to grow and I ordered the Linksys BEFSR11 out of desperation.The Linksys unit worked right out of the box, almost literally.  It took me only an hour from unboxing to having multiple PC's on the Internet.  The majority of the time was spent researching my DSL providers PPOE settings.  I have the modem running to the router and then running with a regular category 5 cable to a dumb hub and then each PC is connected to the hub.  The router assigns valid Internet IP's to each PC and all my interne applications work great.  Napster, ICQ, Newsgroups, and IRC all work wonderfully.  Another great side affect of going to the router is that my overall access speed is about twenty percent faster then it was connecting directly from the computer to the modem.This is a wonderful device and I have recommended it to all my friends and family who are know entering the broadband world via cable or DSL.  Thanks Linksys!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Consumer line of routers on the market today!", "unixReviewTime": 977875200, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2000"}
