The size is tiny, which I love. We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging). Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 \"adjust levels\" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.Speaking of software, the program that came with the camera 2 years ago was horrible, but they've since upgraded to a program that's decent which you can download from the Canon website (and likely they provide the latest software with current purchases--I'm not sure).The normal zoom works well, but when you get into the \"digital zoom,\" everything gets fuzzy--both the viewscreen and the actual pictures are big blurs. So I just don't use that feature.Overall, it's a decent buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "pics a little dark,", "unixReviewTime": 1027123200, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2002"}
