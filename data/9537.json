This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR. It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow. Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste). Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc. The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same size as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint. The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent for travel", "unixReviewTime": 970617600, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2000"}
