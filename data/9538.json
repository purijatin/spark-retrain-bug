Much faster than the Olympus D320L I used previously. While the LCD screen is small, you can zoom in on shots in memory (effectively 9x) so it's possible to get a good idea of the quality of any shot. The panoramic mode is incredibly cool - the camera fixes the exposure settings and lets you view the previous shot before you take the next one over. The camera comes with software that aligns and stiches the shots together to form a panorama. I did one set of 12 pictures to form a 180 degree circle shot - amazing. Overall, it's a great little camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Too cute for words", "unixReviewTime": 970790400, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2000"}
