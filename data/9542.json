If the camera were any smaller, it would be difficult to use.  And the price is very reasonable, especially when you consider that it comes with a rechargable lithium ion battery and a  charger.  In the past, you would have to spend around $100 for just the  battery and charger.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 961200000, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2000"}
