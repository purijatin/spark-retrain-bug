After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.2.1 mega-pixels (2.02 effective, according to manual) is nothing to write home about -- and the Canon continues to take under-saturated pictures -- but the picture quality is top-rate, besting many 3-mp cameras I have tested.  The quality shows when you print the images, even at 5&quot;x7&quot;.  I use an Epson 875DC and the images are many times better than those taken with my other digicams, even under the same shooting conditions.This camera is also easy to use; you can start shooting away after you unpack and charge the included LiIon battery.  The LCD viewfinder is small but very clear.  One good thing: your nose won't touch the LCD when you use the optical viewfinder (unless you have a very small face).  Battery life is decent: I get about 50 shots with all flash and LCD on.  Obviously you get more if you turn off LCD, and even more if you don't need flash all the time.This camera turns heads.  Every time I take it out I can hear people around me talking about it.  Some will ask me if they can hold it.  I'm always proud to tell them that it takes great pictures, too.  I love this little camera.So, what are you waiting for?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No longer a skeptic", "unixReviewTime": 979257600, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2001"}
