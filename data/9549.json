The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it. The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it. But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.The larger the CompactFlash card that you use, the slower  it takes for the ELPH to turn on. It takes about 2-3 seconds of pressing  the on button plus 2 more seconds till you can shoot a picture. I  understand this is to prevent automatic turn-ons but sometimes I want to  immediately take a picture.That aside, this is a great camera. I bought  a 32mb CompactFlash to go with it and shoot in Fine mode (1600x1200  compressed) and get about 50-60 images. It takes about 4 seconds to  transfer each picture via USB to my Apple G3 PowerBook.The QTVR  (panorama) generating software is great. It eliminates much of the hard  work for the user. But you really need to keep it on a stable surface to do  this well.I also have an ELPH Jr. APS camera. (With a black body before  Canon changed it.) It got it because it was so portable (i.e. usable). This  is every bit as enjoyable. I rarely ever use the flash. The zoom works  perfectly fine, though I'm not much of a zoom user. My friend has an S10  and his pictures are a little better, but the S100 wins out for its  tremendous portability.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small, delightful and well-designed", "unixReviewTime": 962668800, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2000"}
