I cant even feel it's there when it's in my shirt pocket and it's so small it slides way down so it doesn't fall out (even when I  scrambled around on mountain hikes). Simple and so easy to use that you can forgive any minor deficiencies, such as the LCD screen data being hard to see in a noonday sun in southern Arizona. Get a larger memory flash card. I did get a ScanDisk card reader. Goodbye 35mm reflex with 300mm zoom lenses. Goodbye movie camera. Taking pictures is fun again for the first time in years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Did I say I would never lug a camera around again?", "unixReviewTime": 978739200, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2001"}
