Don't get me wrong, the image quality is still superb.  The size more than makes up for it. The features are lacking a bit compared to the newer models, but you'll fall in love with this camera. I bought a digital camera and sold it after 2 days when I found out I could get this camera from a friend. So far I'm loving it. It's actually very easy to use and the rechargeable batteries are a big plus. You might need to get an extra compact flash card to avoid missing that perfect shot when it comes along, but other than that, it's a great camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get it", "unixReviewTime": 1013817600, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2002"}
