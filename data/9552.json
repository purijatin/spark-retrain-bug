This is the one if you're looking for a dependable point-and-click without the steep learning curve and without all the fancy extras you probably won't use. Buy a bigger memory card, and a backup battery and you're set. You will want to take it everywhere.Pros: Excellent pics, ultra-compact, easy-to-use, good s/w bundle, super-durableCons: Controls a bit tiny, short battery life, wish Canon included the caseTip: To conserve the battery, turn the LCD viewfinder off and just use its optical viewfinder like a regular camera to take pics. After taking a pic, leave the button depressed and it'll pop-up in the LCD after a second for you to review it until you let go. I have yet to even open my backup battery using the camera this way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Point-and-click ease with an attitude", "unixReviewTime": 1006041600, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2001"}
