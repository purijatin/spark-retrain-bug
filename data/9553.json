Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.  I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.  The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.  I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.  A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.  Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them, I'd say that this camera is perfect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small For A Reason", "unixReviewTime": 1021248000, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2002"}
