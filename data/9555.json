Geaney", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I bought this camera for Christmas along with an HP Photosmart 1115 printer and a 128 meg Viking flash card.  The software installed fine on my Win 98SE machine and I have had no problems.  The camera takes great pictures and the print outs look super sharp when you use photo quality paper.  The movie functionality is great.  The 128 card might be a bit too bit, I would go with at least a 64mb card unless you plan on taking a ton of pictures.  I hope that Chris Gerardi's girl lets him buy one.  He a bit whipped though so he might not be able to.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This camera is F'n Mint!", "unixReviewTime": 1013644800, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2002"}
