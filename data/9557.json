It's simply awesome and the quality od pic's are incredible. Another great thing about  it is that it's so compact and easy to use. You can carry it with you  anywhere and just take a shot. The menu functions are easy to read and the  lcd monitor is sharp for it's size. The only thing I would recommend is  that you upgrade the 8mb compact memory card since you can only take 11  pictures at 1200 x 1600 resolution and 46 at the lowest resolution. The  software is super easy to use and once you connect the USB port to the  camera, the sofware automatically opens up with the pictures right in front  of you. It's a great buy and no one will be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite toy!", "unixReviewTime": 969321600, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2000"}
