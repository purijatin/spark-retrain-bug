I'd had an APS  ELPH and was fairly happy with the pictures it took so I bought this when I  first saw it.  I love it.  I can carry it in my pocket anywhere.  I bought  a 128MB CompactFlash Card that holds over 200 pictures at the intermediate  setting (I compared this setting to the high setting and honestly have to  enlarge the photo to 600% before I can barely tell the difference).  With  this card, I don't need another.  They have a 192MB Card out now.  If your  going to travel, you'll want an extra battery also.  No other camera on the  market is even close to this for the best all round package.  I've printed  out pictures at different sizes with Yahoo/Shutterfly and at 8x10 you can't  tell the difference from a 35mm handheld.  It is still not as sharp as my  35mm SLR - but that likely has a lot to do with the physical size of the  lense.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent package.  Everything is in this tiny camera.", "unixReviewTime": 968112000, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2000"}
