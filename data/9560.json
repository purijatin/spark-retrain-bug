I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine. I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket. 2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!! Fool proof. I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all). 3- USB kicks! 2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture! 4- Looks great. Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC. 5- Excelent software package. 6- Small but very clear TFT screen. Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't. Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT. 7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal. 8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything. Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany. 9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply the best", "unixReviewTime": 986601600, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2001"}
