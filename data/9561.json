It's so tiny that I take it everyplace. Easy to  use, elegant design, battery life is great. USB interface is a huge improvement in speed and reliability over the serial interface I had on my previous camera (Olympus). The only thing that really annoys me about this camera is the location of the on/off button. Too many times I've hit it by accident instead of the shutter button when I was in a hurry, and turned off the camera instead of getting my picture!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extremely cool.", "unixReviewTime": 985219200, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2001"}
