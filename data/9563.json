It's size makes it very convenient to use.  It's loaded with features - stich assist is a nice feature, manual mode , black and white.  Resolution can be adjusted between 3 different settings. It takes very nice quality pictures especially once you get the hang of adjusting settings in the manual mode you'll find you can take nice pictures in whatever lighting conditions.  You can play back pictures individually or as a slide show.  It keeps a record of the settings for every picture you take which is nice.  Transfering images to your computer via USB port is a snap.  Only real weaknesses are the 8mb flash card &amp; single rechargable battery it comes with.  You will definitely need a bigger CF card and a backup battery.  Overall an excellent camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Alot in a small camera", "unixReviewTime": 994982400, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2001"}
