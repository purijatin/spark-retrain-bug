I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card. Here are some useful facts:- On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures. A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture). The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken. The LCD should be used. However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder. The digital zoom is crap. Turn it off. It fits in your pocket. The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp). But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera. I take my camera everywhere. Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera. The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff. The panorama setting is unbelieveable ! You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing ! The pictures are a little dark sometimes. You have the option to have the flash automatic or off. I would have liked to force the flash on as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Most practical camera", "unixReviewTime": 980380800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2001"}
