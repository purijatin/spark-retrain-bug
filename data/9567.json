Sande \"pdantic\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240. This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting. The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive. I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures. The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots. I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack. My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be. I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time! Other than that, I love this camera. The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great little digital camera!", "unixReviewTime": 994464000, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2001"}
