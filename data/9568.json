You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.  You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.This is my first digital camera I've owned, so I wantedemphasis some points to all my felow novice photographers that otherreviewers may have already pointed out: 1) there's no intermediateresolution quality setting; it's either the normal 640 x 480, thebetter 1600 x 1200, or the best super fine 1600 x1200. Which, ofcourse, means the better quality pictures you want to take, the morestorage space you need. I recommend a 32M, or better, Compact Flashcard...  2)Buy an extra battery.  The batter will last around 70 or sopictures using a flash, with the LCD turned off, but if you plan ongoing on vacation, you will definitly need one.  3)Image quality isinconsistent.  This could be my fault, but under the camera automaticsetting, some pictures come out way too dark, red, or blurry.  This isspecially true when taking pictures indoors.  But daylight outdoorpictures are truely beautiful.  4) You need to hold the camera verysteady when taking pictures due to its small size.  Otherwise pictureswill turn out blurry.Overall, I love this new toy.  I woulddefinitly recommend it to first time digital camera owners.  It willtake you some time to learn to operate it but after that it will be apiece of cake. Enjoy!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Happyt together", "unixReviewTime": 975110400, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2000"}
