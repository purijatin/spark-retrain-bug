Gross", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewtext": "This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).  It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.The only negative comments I have about it is that I personally find the small controls hard to use (my 48-year-old eyes have trouble seeing something this small).  I have had some annoying problems with the software on my Windows 98 machine; basically I have to uninstall the driver everytime I disconnect the camera or the computer will look for it, not find it, and crash the next time I restart the machine.  I would not recommend this camera for the naive computer user.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This is the one to get", "unixReviewTime": 976060800, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2000"}
