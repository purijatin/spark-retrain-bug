But if you can find one, you might like to get it. It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.If you believe, as I do, that the utility of a camera is inversely proportional to its size, you can't help but love this camera. I take it with me almost everywhere, even when I don't expect to take a picture. It fits in a pocket easily, and you soon forget about it. I have so many picture I've taken with this camera that I wouldn't have taken otherwise, simply because I wouldn't have bothered to take the camera with me.Is 2MP enough? For most purposes, I would say yes. You have more than enough pixels for an excellent 5x7. And if you do no cropping whatsoever, you can make a barely acceptable 8x10. The lens and sensor combination seem to work well together, and I haven't been bothered by noise or odd colors. Flash is anemic but usable up close ~10 ft.The proof is in the pictures, and I love the ones I've made with this camera.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Gone but not forgotten", "unixReviewTime": 1026000000, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2002"}
