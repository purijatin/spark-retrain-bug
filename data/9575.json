For some reason, the older printer works better with 3/4\" tape, though it is rated for the 1/4\" width, too.I used another new tape in this same label printer, and it broke. I contacted Brother to ask about a replacement, and never heard from them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Brother P-Touch Tape can be cranky", "unixReviewTime": 1188518400, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2007"}
