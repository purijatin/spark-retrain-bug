I use it to print labels for my daughter's bottles at daycare.  I have the dishwasher set to heated dry time in order to sanitize the bottles and the tape has survived five cycles so far without melting or moving.  It's wonderful.The print is clear and not runny and because the laminate is placed over the printing, it continues to look as great as when I first printed them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow.", "unixReviewTime": 1252713600, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2009"}
