That is not the case. Although it is ok it is not wonderful, the edges look a bit fuzzy, not nearly as sharp as the other tapes I used. The black on clear is wonderful... but not the white on clear. Somewhat disappointing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not very crisp...", "unixReviewTime": 1227312000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2008"}
