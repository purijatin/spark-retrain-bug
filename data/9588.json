Shults", "helpful": [2, 5], "reviewtext": "I got hooked on the Brother P-Touch label maker at work, and even though I could borrow it occasionally for home use (and not have to pay for the label tape, which is expensive), I got sick of not having it at hand to print a label on the spur of the moment (which is how you want to be able to print labels). I bought what seems to be a top-of-the-line unit which prints on several tape widths (our last machine only printed on 1/2\" tape), and I really like having recourse to this wider labeling tape, which allows more room for clearly printing information such as name tags with address, etc.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like the wider tape!", "unixReviewTime": 1170892800, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2007"}
