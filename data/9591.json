When I received my order, it was the newer TZe tapes, and I was concerned they would not fit. But alas, they are fine. However, if you have a newer machine, I understand the older TZ tapes will not work because the newer machines have an extra post in the tape area. Not sure about that since I don't have a newer machine. But I will tell you the new TZe tapes work fine in the older models. I use the White on Black tape to name the various buttons on TV's, receivers, etc. that are too small to read otherwise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "TZ or TZE IN OLDER MACHINES", "unixReviewTime": 1362268800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2013"}
