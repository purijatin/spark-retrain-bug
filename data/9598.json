I see where all the hype comes from!I bought this in error at first thinking it would be as powerful as a Nikon SB-800, but I was wrong.It is not as powerful as an SB-800, but it is a little more powerful than my SB-600's.I use my 285's when shooting outdoors against the sun, and at full power, they never ceases to deliver!!!My SB-600's are fine, but not as powerful (slightly), but they do get hot, and tend to make a burning smell after a few FULL power bursts.The Vivitar is only a manual flash, but it is not an issue for me as I tend to use my SB-600's the same way.So far, I have never smelled burning from my 285's, however, if there is a complaint, it is the same complaint that many have....which is it's super slow recycle time when shooting a full power...10-seconds!!!!I am not a snap happy photographer, so it doesn't kill my photo shoot, but the SB-600's do recycle much faster given the same power setting.Other than that, these are my new favs.  My SB's work great for shooting parties with TTL metering/control, but for my outdoor work, I grab my 285's first!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dedicated Work Horse!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1233878400, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2009"}
