This camera has no cons for me if you know what you are getting. I need controllable light and this bad boy does the job! I had on of this on a light stand and fell - and nothing was broken. If you are a fancy photographer then go for the more expensive ones. It is all about the light not how much your flash cost that makes good lighting. This is excellent for manual flash as I don't do TTL. I have a 580 EX II that I use indoors but this always comes with me day or night. I use 4 Eneloop rechargeable batteries on this flash and it just keeps flashing consistently.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Work horse of a flash", "unixReviewTime": 1287878400, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2010"}
