Hefty.Old school professional toy for advanced amateurs, serious photographers, and pros. The built-in variable power of the VIVITAR 285HV auto flash unit provides you with options for fill or full flash and the ability to shoot properly exposed rapid-sequence pictures.The vertical bounce capability of this flash also allows you to redirect the otherwise harsh flash of light for better control and softer lighting.The four f-stops Vari-Power gives you control over the flash distance range and the depth of field.  On the other hand, the auto Thyristor circuitry allows for a faster recycling time as well as more flashes per set of batteries.When the VIVITAR 285HV is powered by the JTL Battery PackJTL High Voltage Compact Battery Pack for the 200 and 300 Model Mobilights....this Flash unit + BP combo is a real killer - only 1~2 sec for full charge!A full review and more sample photography is vailable at shutterbugcl DOT blogspot DOT com or check the pix watermarked with the link.Accessories I also use in most of photographs:GotLux?
