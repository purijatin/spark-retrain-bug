I really like the sb700 for on camera flash work, but I find myself reaching for the vivitar anytime I need to fill a room with light or if I am not in a time-pressure shooting situation.  It has more power than the sb700 and the batteries seem to last much longer.  If you want to give off camera flash photography a try on a budget, I would forgo the high-end Nikon/Canon flashes altogether and grab one of these.  All of that metering intelligence is not worth an extra couple hundred dollars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Flash", "unixReviewTime": 1322265600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2011"}
