I have many Vivitar lenses, specily the 100 mm macro, and all others, no one goes bad. I have 2 Vivitar 283 flash, I use them for more than 25 years, and they perform like new, I hope that this 285 will do the same, it is so far so good. Many thanks to Vivitar.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Vivitar", "unixReviewTime": 1213574400, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2008"}
