Big mistake. First, the flash head is so big you'll find a hard time finding diffusers that will fit it. Second, the instruction manual is almost useless. Next making adjustment to power is needlessly cumbersome, and finally the recycle time is almost 10 seconds!  I bought a Yongnuo and found it superior in every way.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Don't Do It", "unixReviewTime": 1400284800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2014"}
