Now they are made in China and prone to high failure. The one that I bought 1 year ago made a snapping and crackling sound the other day and then refused to fire after that. Efforts to contact the number on the warranty were fruitless; the company has gone out of business and will not service its flashes. If you really want an old-school Vivi that won't fail, get a 283 made in Japan off of Ebay.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Stay away, this is not your father's Vivitar", "unixReviewTime": 1247011200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2009"}
