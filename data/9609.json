Takes a little experimenting with my camera which is a non TTL. Therefore, everything is set by hand. But once you have made several tests you will get the hang of it. The only thing missing is the swivel head. Zoom head and bounce flash are a plus. Got a whole lot of flashes from batteries before needing replacement. I have been using 2200mha rechargeables. The product has been around for years, but this is the newer flash which allows digital cameras to be used that need less than 12v, otherwise, using the older unit could damage a digital camera. Highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "IT'S A WINNER", "unixReviewTime": 1273363200, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2010"}
