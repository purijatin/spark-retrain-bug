I expected a flash that would adjust itself to the camera settings and provide the correct flash in all situations that were within it's range; not so. Or maybe it would work the other way around and the flash would set the camera settings; not so either. I'm going to check, and if there is such a flash, this one will go back; fast.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Automatic means that it will work fine without a camera", "unixReviewTime": 1365206400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2013"}
