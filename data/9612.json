If you need to take fast pictures, with it mounted on  the camera shoe, you need to adjust it every time , because it does not have TTL circuit, and you can burn the pictures. and for this reason it is better to buy the TTL flash of your camera to avoid this kind of situation on fast moments taking pictures, like the kiss on the wedding ceremony.but for the rest it is a good flash.i do recomend it", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great powerfull flash", "unixReviewTime": 1256860800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2009"}
