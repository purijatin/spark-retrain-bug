I went to a camera shop I trusted and asked what they recommended for a very portable lighting setup.  I was handed a pair of 285HV's, umbrellas, stands, mounts, a sync cord and a Wein &#34;peanut&#34;.  Carrying only a few extra sets of AA batteries I could shoot several rolls of indoor portraits and my entire lighting setup fit in a small duffel bag.Later, I added an external turbo 2x2 battery and matching power cables to the mix giving me full day run times and instant flash recycle times.  Still the whole dual strobe setup fit in a small shoulder bag.285HV's run like champs on cheap alkaline AA's, NiMH rechargeables or external battery packs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Low tech, high quality.
