It's simple and basic in function but has everything I need to shoot on and off camera. I hardly use on camera flash (unless I want or need to) and primarily use it off camera with a shoot through/bounce umbrella. I plan on buying another one to set up with a large soft box. It's plenty powerful for a variety of occasions. As a mobile set up and until I get strobes these will work fine!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great value manual flash unit.", "unixReviewTime": 1310515200, "reviewTime": "07 13, 2011"}
