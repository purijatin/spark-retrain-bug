Eventually, after much hounding, the warranty department finally came through and replaced the broken PC cord that came with the flash.  So, I've moved it up to three stars.With that in mind, the flash itself is a four or five star item.  It does just what I want, a not too expensive dumb flash I can use for off camera flash work.  A few adjustable manual power settings, manual zoom and tilt provide about all the variables really needed for off camera flash work.  Sure, it'd be great if it would tilt more than 90 degrees, or swivel as well, but these things are more important for on camera work.  There could be more manual power settings too, but three is good enough for most work.So, if you want to get a cheap, apparently reliable (so far) flash for off camera strobe work it is hard to go wrong with this flash.  Be warned though, you may need to be very persistent with the warranty department if you have a problem!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice flash, warranty service a bit of a pain...", "unixReviewTime": 1201737600, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2008"}
