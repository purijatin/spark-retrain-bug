My first one (~3 years old) is still going strong and has seen a lot of use and some abuse ;)  On the downside the plastic shoe mount is worrying but has not given me any issues to date and I do use this on light stands and with triggers that attach to the shoe mount.  This flash is also best used in full manual mode with settings to full, half, quarter, and 1/16 power.  It would be very nice if the settings would go lower...1/32 and 1/64 would be awesome and I would never buy another type of flash ;)  To overcome this you can buy very cheap ND gels that slip right into the slot and provide a power reduction but be cautioned firing off shots too quickly while gels are in place as I have melted a couple this way.  As far as the good news goes these flashes are extremely powerful for the price you pay and they just plain work.  My much more expensive SB600 will often times go into to sleep mode and not fire the first time I push the trigger...this guy will fire every time.  The only downside to this availability is battery life...keep batteries on hand and don't expect to be able to use rechargeables...for me they work but not for long at all.  Overall if you understand and accept the the limitations of this flash it will be an awesome piece of equipment for you.  If you come in expecting full functionality of much pricier units you will be disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Low Cost Flash For Manual Setup", "unixReviewTime": 1327536000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2012"}
