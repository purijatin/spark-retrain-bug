I can find no fault in this flash. I love using manual flash so this flash is perfect and gets the job done. I'm only two years into photography and with my limited experience I was able to figure out the calculator on the side of the flash. If anything it's a nice extra inexpensive flash to have in your gear.I bought some 12x12 gels and cut them down to wallet size (3.5in x 2in) and they fit perfect in the slot in the side of the flash head. This makes it perfect for lighting up a white wall behind your subject with cool colors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great flash", "unixReviewTime": 1320710400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2011"}
