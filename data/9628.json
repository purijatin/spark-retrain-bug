In comparing flash units, this one wins, hands down. I purchased a dedicated flash and 2 of these units. The dedicated flash was about $200. These are about $85. These have more consistent exposes and plenty of power. Simply set the camera on Manual and set the flash. I use them with the Cowboy wireless shoes.Over the past 40 years I have used various versions of the Vivitar 283 and 285 flash units. At one time I was shooting a wedding each week with a couple of them. I sometimes try other types of flash units, but always come back to these flash units. This flash is not expensive, but the 283 and 285 units are a true work-horses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1337817600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2012"}
