Have to return it for a safe one.Before putting a 285HV on your camera, please check with the camera manufacturer first.  The 285 HV open circuit trigger voltage measures as much as 12 V. and many cameras are not rated for this voltage. Canon USA claims that Canon SLRs should not be used with triggers above 6V. and Olympus says don't exceed 10 V.  Nikon says 12V. is the maximum safe trigger voltage.  Cameras that meet the ISO 10330 spec. are supposed to be safe up to 24V.Most modern cameras use solid state flash circuits (not mechanical contacts as old cameras did), so the use of even a slight overvoltage can instantly do serious damage.  Building a \"universal\" electronic flash with a 12V. trigger voltage for today's cameras is really not very smart engineering when most well engineered units trigger using 3 or 4 Volts maximum.It's interesting that Vivatar uses a \"HV\" designation for this flash unit.  The old (film era) \"plain\" Vivitar 285 and Vivitar 283 flashes had a trigger voltage of over 250 Volts, but the \"HV\" version is 12V, which, unfortunately is still too HV for many cameras.If you do a web search for \"Electronic flash trigger voltage\", you will find tons of info on this subject.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Caution high trigger voltage!
