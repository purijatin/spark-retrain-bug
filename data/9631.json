Based on a web review, I bought a couple of Vivitar 285HV's and used them with my existing off-camera triggering system (which consists of Elinchrom Skyport radio triggers and Wein optical hot shoe triggers).  All of my existing triggers fired through the hot shoe of the flash and have worked with a variety of flashes, including older Vivitar 283 flashes.However, the 285HV is triggered on a different contact point than most flashes.  It works fine on-camera, but doesn't work at all with any of these remote triggering options.I've found that you need to use the trigger port on the side of the flash.  Wein peanut slaves have a high failure rate, but Sonia triggers seem to work much more consistently well with this flash.Once your system is working, these will fire consistently well.  They don't recycle as fast as some of the more modern and expensive designs, but if you take your time and compose each shot well, you should be just fine.  I've been replacing all of my other flashes and standardizing now on the 285HV for my field gear.I use these for semi-professional fashion and art photography and it often surprises people to see me using such humble looking equipment and yet I get great results from them.*** LONG TERM UPDATE ***These flashes only last a little over a year and then they are kaput. I have had a few of them, all purchased around the same time, and in the middle of a shoot they will suddenly flash brightly and then not work anymore. As far as I can tell, these units are sealed up and not meant to be repaired.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "solid work horse with a gotcha", "unixReviewTime": 1228003200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2008"}
