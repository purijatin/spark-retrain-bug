I found it a little difficult to figure out, but once I did it became my favorite accessory. I use it with a Canon t3i and my photos are great. I recommend that a diffuser be purchased along with the flash. I purchased an Opteka SB-1 Mini Universal Studio Soft Box Flash Diffuser and it works great. Just be careful not to drop. I unfortunately did this and had several pieces fall off. Luckily, all but one snapped right back in place. The other was a silver disc that was super glued on the side opposite the manual computer. I put it back with a much better glue. The flash still works great with only a couple scratches.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love this Flash.", "unixReviewTime": 1365897600, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2013"}
