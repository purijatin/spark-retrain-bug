You don't get TTL, and you can't swivel the top.However, if you are into off-camera \"Strobist\" type of lighting, this is a nice, cheap flash to use for your secondary flashes.Realize of course there are only 4 power-levels on full-manual.  Full, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/16.  There are no inbetweens, if you want to vary the output on your subject, you either move the flash head in/out or you shoot into a neutral density filter to reduce the output.  Either method works fine.  I also think it's rather weird that there is no 1/8 power, but again, if you have a 1-stop neutral density filter, this is easily achieved without moving the flash.This flash DOES have a high-pitched whine to it that does not go away when it's fully charged.  It's not loud and annoying, but you can hear it if you listen hard enough.Overall this is a good flash that puts out lots of light.  I have heard reports that the newer models being manufactured in China are not built quite as tough as the first release, so you might do well to pick one up used rather than new.  These things are built like a brick, and the older Vivitar 283/285's are STILL working after 30 years, so that will tell you what type of quality this brand has.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice little flash for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1233532800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2009"}
