For me, there were two separate dealbreakers which forced me to return this in favor of a Lumopro 160.  These may not be dealbreakers for you, though, but I wanted to mention them here since nothing in the descriptions here made these two issues apparent prior to ordering:1) the opening of the flash head is large, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, if you plan to use the largest size roguebender unit in a wrap-around-to-form-a-snoot mode, or to use the rogue grid set, this is a problem.  It is just too big for that.2) the sync port is a PROPRIETARY connector.  Dealbreaker for sure.  You can't use your normal connectors/cables from your existing radio trigger units.  The cables or adapters from pocket wizard are $25 each, which degrades the bargain status of this unit quite a bit.  Plus you have to carry and keep track of separate, special cables/connectors.For my specific purpose, mixing this in with studio lights as a small noot or grid spot, these were deal breakers.  If your use is more general, these are probably stlll a good deal: they will fill an umbrella nicely, and they work nicely enough on the hotshoe.  They feel sturdy.  The wide angle adapter is okay, but is a separate piece that slides in, not attached to the light, so it is another loose item to keep track of or lose.For my specific purpose, this simply is too much hassle, and won't play with the modifiers I want to use.
