The only con I really have with it is the plastic foot.  I can see how it could easily break. That combined with the cheep hot shoe cord I bought, I am always VERY careful when I use it.  I've just now (today actaully.. the light bulb just kind of went off) started to understand it more and get comfortable using it and the timing couldn't be more perfect.  I'm using it this coming weekend at a wedding I'm shooting, so we'll see how it goes!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just now getting used to it, but so far so good", "unixReviewTime": 1252281600, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2009"}
