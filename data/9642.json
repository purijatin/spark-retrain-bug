I read up on a few sites that sometimes this flash can burn out the camera because of the voltage, so I bought this and used a voltmeter on it.  It came in below the max voltage for the camera (I can't recall the specific numbers now), so I tried it out and all worked fine.  I use this when I need a powerful flash.  I'm sure some of the Canon Speedlites are better, but they're also much more expensive.  I've had no problems with this flash and am very happy with it.  I would definitely buy this product again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Flash", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"}
