The SB-600 I have will go into standby mode in a minute or two if I don't use it. This Vivitar flash won't, and that's a good thing because I don't have to wake it up. It is always up and ready to be fired. It may use more power that way, but I don't care since I have a lot of rechargeable AA batteries ready. Great flash !!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A reliable and affordable flash", "unixReviewTime": 1271376000, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2010"}
