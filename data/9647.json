Its a powerful flash with accurate exposure using the coloured \"auto\" modes. There are you tube videos on how to use this - it only takes 10 mins to figure out how to use it. Only cons are that its a little big and noisy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Powerfull, durable inexpensive flash", "unixReviewTime": 1316390400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2011"}
