Tarquinio", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "As I have mentioned in other reviews of Fuji film products, this one is no exception.  The ISO 200 is an excellent medium for generating some fine color prints.  I highly recommend this company and the film offerings they have.Their pricing is more than fair and processing does not take very long.  If you like film photography as I do, and have not tried Fuji products, I highly recommend firing off a test roll.  Thanks for reading.Tony", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound, more powerful than a locomotive and faster than a speeding bullet.", "unixReviewTime": 1360886400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2013"}
