I have used Fujifilm Super HQ in various ASA speeds.  I prefer the 24 exposure roll, as in my work, I really don't need to have 36 exposure.  But the quality of the photographs are just awesome, bright, vibrant colors. In many cases, a great film under controlled as well as adverse climate conditions.  I use digital photography as well as film.  I prefer film.  It makes a great archive of special events.  I recommend this film to anyone - amature and professional photographer alike.  This film certainly has a place in your camera bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Infidel Dog's Review of 35mm 4-pk Color Fujifilm", "unixReviewTime": 1262736000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2010"}
