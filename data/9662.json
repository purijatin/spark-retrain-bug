I'm a traditionalist, I love the look of analog over digital.Fuji 800 is a nice film stock in my opinion.  I like to see grain and slightly flat colors.  I don't mean that in a critical way, Fuji absolutely retains color information in the negative (which can be brought out easily in Photoshop - one of the digital era tools that I do love)  Since it has a wide latitude, you can shoot in relatively low light situations while still getting a fair amount of quality.  You will see a good amount of grain, but this is what I love about analog film.  It's got a more rustic quality to it, and isn't cringe-worthy like that of digital noise.Sharpness, colors, detail... all this of course depends on what camera you are using, lenses, and the subject.  I used this for more of a travel-journalistic approach and have found that because of it's latitude you can easily shoot in many light situations without the hassle of too much adjusting.  With proper lighting setups, then this film easily will provide you with what you need for decent 35mm prints (let's be honest, you can't blow up 35 too much anyway)  For \"better\" image detail with less grain, then opt for the 2 or 400 speed film.  Of course, you will not have the benefit of being able to shoot with less light.Great price.  Also pretty damn near impossible to find hour developing places anymore!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lost Art.", "unixReviewTime": 1377648000, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2013"}
