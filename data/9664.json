Most of what I take looks like a postcard with this film.  I've photographed things in the worst lighting conditions with no problems whatsoever with this film.  It can be light at times, depending on the developer, but all-in-all, I'm VERY satisfied with this film and buy it quite frequently.  Most of what I use it for are photographs of family, but it is also used for items pictured on ebay and it just does a wonderful job.  I can't recommend this film enough!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome film!", "unixReviewTime": 1088985600, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2004"}
