Osborne \"DaveO\"", "helpful": [13, 13], "reviewtext": "A few years ago I discovered by accident that this 800 film produces vibrantly colorful prints in all levels of light.  Now I use it in bright, sunny locations without hesitation, as well as indoors, and with flash.  Outdoor scenes with lots of greenery are especially saturated with color.My only complaint is minor - caucasion complexions tend to appear slightly pale, unless focus and exposure are set especially for the skin.  That's not enough to keep me from using the film, though. My specialty is photographing children at play outdoors, and this film has become my \"default\" film when I can't predict sun/shade situations.  I know I'll be fine no matter what conditions are when it's picture time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rich colors, especially for landscapes", "unixReviewTime": 1124409600, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2005"}
