Just not economical to produce,stock and sell I guess. Digital is the thing now.This film is 800 ASA. It allows you to use higher shutter speeds and tighter apertures so you can get better pictures in lower light situations or to stop motion of a busy subject (kids). I think the relative merits of different films and brands of film is becoming moot. ANY film you are able to find will be good film!Get some now and keep it in your fridge for later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Good Fast Film", "unixReviewTime": 1321660800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2011"}
