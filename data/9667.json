Greaux", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewtext": "I was pleasantly surprised as I delve back into film photography, at how flexible, colorful and grain-free is this Fujifilm Reala 800!  I used it for the first time it in my modern Zeiss Ikon 35 mm super-gorgeous rangefinder w/ 50mm Planar f2.0; 8x10 enlargements showed zero grain and a wonderful almost 3D quality in the prints.  I really am pleased with my results vs my digital equipment. In a nutshell: a little contrasty, beautiful color, sharp, really forgiving (exposure) no visible grain and a wonderful realistic 3D quality. Also handles indoor lighting really well without the funky green tint that I've seen with other films. I haven't tried it outdoors (may be pushing my luck) but indoors it has been awesome!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fine Grain? How about no grain!", "unixReviewTime": 1293408000, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2010"}
