The colors are good and the grain is minimal. My go-to film is Fujicolor 200 because it can be had so inexpensively, but when I need a couple extra stops I reach for this Superia X-tra 800 every time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great color, low grain", "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2013"}
