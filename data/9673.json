I'm not really that worried about grain since that's part of the draw of shooting film nowadays (at least it is for me).When I shoot on film, I use a Pentax ME Super without a flash, hence why I use ISO 800, since when I'm at f/2.8 I can shoot comfortably in a reasonably well lit room.  And when I'm shooting on overcast days, this film still keeps the pictures looking good.The final reason that this is most often in my camera (if I'm not shooting Kodak bw4oocn) is because its affordable and readily available.  Fuji makes great film and this is a solid performer for general use.My only concern is that I've had some issues with the film being to tight and it some rolls have been a little hard to load or to catch on the winder (its simply harder to pull out of the cassette).  Half of that is user error, but it seems like I have to try more often to get this film to catch in the mechanism (and in an point and shoot camera you probably won't notice if the film isn't actually advancing).  Just be careful loading and it should all go smoothly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid film", "unixReviewTime": 1232236800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2009"}
