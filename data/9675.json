It's fast with less grain than some 400 speed films, imo.  Colors are as vivid as it gets for a film this speed, and it can be used outdoors. This film is very versatile. So much so, that I generally use this now instead of 400 speed films if shooting with focal lenghts beyond the standard 50.  It's also quite inexpensive. Don't even bother with the Kodak 800 speed films. Though more readily available, this Fuji product is /way/ superior in every respect.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best 800 Speed Film on the Market", "unixReviewTime": 1136851200, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2006"}
