The Fuji's fixed focal length lens is nice and sharp, and the combination of the sharp lens with this film produces brilliantly colored, sharp photos. I've had a number of photos with this film blown up to 8 x 12 size, and it's surprising how sharp and ungrainy the photos are. You really can't see the grain all that well except at ASA400 looking at a patch of blue sky. I've framed and mounted some of these photos on the wall of my office, and have gotten many compliments on them over the last several months by people who've dropped by my office. (Of course, it helps that these photos were of the Bryce Canyon Nat'l Park Amphitheater. Bryce Canyon has to be about the most photogenic place on earth.) If the person is a knowledgeable photographer, they're always surprised to find out the photos were taken with an APS camera with its smaller film format and relatively fast, ASA400 film. One thing I've noticed is that this film doesn't punch up the color intensities, especially in the green and blue range, as much as the Fuji Velvia series, which produces the most riotous colors you could possibly want. If you want really brilliant and intense colors, you can't beat the Velvia film. The Nexia film is closer to actual reality, and sometimes I prefer that to the Velvia. Either way, I've gotten good results from both films.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent performance", "unixReviewTime": 998870400, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2001"}
