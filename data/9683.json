I see another reviewer mentioned problems with his olymus and a difference when used in it. My camera is not one of the more expensive one, so I don't expect mych out of it. I find that the pictures are good for my average use.  SO check this out, not a problem in my book, but you may have to check for yourself.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Comparable with the Kodak, and save a bit", "unixReviewTime": 1170979200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2007"}
