The photos were taken approximately from depths ranging from above water-3 feet deep.  All of the photos lack really good sharpness, clarity and are somewhat fuzzy.  If you can remember the 35mm camera taking days you will understand exactly what to expect.These photos represent that cheaper rolls of 200 speed film that one could buy for their 35mm cameras back then.  If you recall the absence of crispness, detail and such...then you know exactly what i am talking about.  For that is how all of my photos turned out.Slightly below average photos.  If you were going to take a bunch of photos i would suggest buying a cheaper, compact digital camera and one of the waterproof pouches that allow for taking of pictures underwater.  A digital camera that does not have the telescopic lens would be ideal in these type bags.By the time you purchase 3 of these cameras and have the pictures developed at $10.00 per, you have already spent enough money to purchase a small compact digital camera.ChrisEastern NC", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok, average or slightly below average photos", "unixReviewTime": 1338422400, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2012"}
