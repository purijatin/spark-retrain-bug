Comparable to CVS pharmacy disposable 35mm.  It went downhill from there:  The underwater pictures were not worth it.  Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper.  But, it's 6 bucks.  So, c'mon, experiment with it.  If you don't like it after that, you're out 15 - 20 bucks after developing.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Fujifilm underwater film camera", "unixReviewTime": 1308009600, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2011"}
