The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier :-)I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts. So once the back plate is installed, you slide the connecting parts together. Much easier! :-)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid, but not the best mount I've had", "unixReviewTime": 1293408000, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2010"}
