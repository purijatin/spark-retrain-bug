The Fuji was easier to wind and to snap shots with and the pictures came out sharper. The 800 film in the Kodak produced shots that were way too grainy.I'd give it 5 stars if they added a flash and a bigger viewfinder!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better than the Alternatives", "unixReviewTime": 1106956800, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2005"}
