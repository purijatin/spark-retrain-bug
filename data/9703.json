We got &#34;money shots&#34; of the boys feeding NURSE SHARKS.  Follow the directions, and you can have good quality photos.  No pictures below 5 feet of water.  No full sun pictures.  There is no stress in giving a 5 year-old a $10.00 camera.  It is a little hard to wind the film knob.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "USE THIS CHEAP CAMERA ON THE BEACH & IN WATER", "unixReviewTime": 1374364800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2013"}
