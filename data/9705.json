Taking photos were easy, and with the camera in the case, we were able to take pictures without worrying about the film, not to mention toss the camera around (or chase after it after getting buffeted by the waves- the camera floats)When developing the photos, they came out slightly blurry (even the ones on the ground) and the colors seemed pale and washed out. While I haven't used film cameras in a while, I'm still positive that the color quality is much higher than what we achieved.Then again, you get what you pay for- and it's not many digital cameras that you can take into an ocean and walk back out of it with your photos. For the price we paid, we're just glad we still have the memories.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Pale, washed out colors", "unixReviewTime": 1263168000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2010"}
