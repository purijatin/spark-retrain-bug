I posted pics above (shots from the Lagoonarium on Bora Bora).  We swam & snorkeled in the ocean there with tropical fish, manta rays & sharks.  Most of the pics turned out really well (& we're not great photographers).  We're so used to seeing it real time on the digital camera, but can't of course with these cameras, so we bought two and took lots of pics.  When you develop them, you can request a CD too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fun great pics (see posted pics above)", "unixReviewTime": 1343865600, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2012"}
