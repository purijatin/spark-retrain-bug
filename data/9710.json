We went to Niagara Falls and knew we were going to be in wet spray on tours beneath the falls, the cave of the winds, and the Maid of the Mist boat to the foot of the falls.I didn't want to use my expensive digital camera in these areas, so we bought the four Fujifilm Quicksnap four camera package.I'm embarrassed to say that the best pictures from the trip came from those cameras. I don't know if film still takes better pictures than digital, or if I just didn't have the settings right on my expensive camera, or maybe professional developing is better, but the cameras did not disappoint. The pictures came out worthy of Postcard quality.Just a few things I liked about using the cameras.They slipped into a pocket easily.The film advance was simple and the knob was large to accomodate slippery conditions.They had a heavy duty rubber strap that would take a very deliberate effort to break.The shutter clicker was large and conveniently placed.An Excellent choice for what we used them for.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Picture postcards", "unixReviewTime": 1255564800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2009"}
