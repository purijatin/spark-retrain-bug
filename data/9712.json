Even on sunny days in crystal clear water they came out mostly gray/green and crude rather than sharp/detailed, so I stopped using it for fish, turtles, coral, etc.  There were usually two or three photos in each batch of 27 that didn't turn out at all.  I had three different developers, so that wasn't the problem.Longs and Walmart definitely did the best job of developing from these cameras.  Longs sells the cameras for about $8 each, too.It did a fine job on easy pictures of people and many landscape shots that weren't taken when the light was too bright or too dim, like twilight, sunset, or indoor pictures.  Under less than ideal lighting, they often came out very crude and grainy with no contrast.It's fine as a temporary cheap camera or for the kids, but you'll probably want a digital camera above water so you can verify and redo your valuable vacation pictures under all lighting conditions.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "decent all around temporary camera", "unixReviewTime": 1163203200, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2006"}
