Plus the Superia X-TRA 800 35mm film is made especially for underwater light, managing the magenta and blues will be balanced, making your pictures more realistic than with regular film.  The camera colors are perfect for easy visibility as well.  I'll bet this could go to 50 feet in depth, but that is risking it.  The manufacturer's are always conservative.  Don't forget its great for snow skiing as well.  Good product for the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Finally!", "unixReviewTime": 1213056000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2008"}
