At least that way we could've taken more shots and figured out if some shots didn't come out.  Now, I'm out all that money and if we go on vacation again, I'll plan to spend money on a waterproof digital camera, but I could have bought that last time and still had it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Worked well, but when you factor in cost of processing, might not be worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1355875200, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2012"}
