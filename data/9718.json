I had to get used to winding it after every picture as its a 35mm camera but it held up great under water. I really didnt expect proffesional quality pix. They were not as clear as digital. totally worth the 5.99 I paid for it. (I uploaded some of my pics)you see and can decide if its the camera for you! :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "decent pix", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013"}
