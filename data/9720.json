Buchheit", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I used this camera on the beach quite a bit last month, and it performed just as I hoped it would. I swam with it a few times, and it survived the submersion with flying colors, even floating to the top a few times when it slipped out of my pocket. I wasn't diving or anything, but for submersion within 10 feet of the surface, it did fine. Can't speak to deeper use.I didn't use the camera to take underwater pics, but it did fine with pictures above water when wet. The resolution is obviously a far cry from what you can get with even the cheapest digital camera now, so you should go in aware that these aren't museum-quality prints or anything. But for what it is, this camera does fine.I also highly recommend buying the camera from Amazon. They're not paying me to say this or anything, but I looked at local drugstores, and the exact same camera was literally 2.5-3 times as expensive. I can't for the life of me figure out why the mark-up is so high, but that's what it is in the Washington, DC, area.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does what it's supposed to", "unixReviewTime": 1348531200, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2012"}
