Now that they're winding down, I've heard their quality has suffered and decided to give Fuji a shot.This took pictures quickly, was easy to operate, and came with a little rubber wrist band. Very convenient.It's also very affordable, eliminating some of the anxiety of using a digital camera.Minus 2 stars for picture quality. Everything came out grainy w/ a blueish tint. Just not a nice way to preserve memories.I have a Kodak digital underwater camcorder which also takes pictures (albeit slowly). It has its own issues, but the picture quality is outrageously better, and I'll stick with it on future trips.Overall, this is quick and convenient. Picture quality is below average and developing photos is twice the cost of the camera. Look at waterproof digital cameras, if they're in your budget.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Disappointing Picture Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1351123200, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2012"}
