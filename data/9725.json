It is pointless unless you have perfect conditions. It was nice to take pictures while 'in the water' because we were not worried about dropping it, but underwater no pictures came out at all. Most picture were taken in middle of afternoon with plenty of light and clear water. Camera was only a few inches under the ocean water and you really can not tell what is in the pictures. Very blurry and dark. Skip this one for underwater.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "almost useless, not good underwater", "unixReviewTime": 1352937600, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2012"}
