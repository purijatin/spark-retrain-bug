It should work for you. I bought the pack of 4 for Cancun mexico while I was underwater taking picture of fish. about 90% of all the pictures were absolute TRASH! The fish were all blurs almost unable to see any fish at all. Complete waste of time and money. I took pictures of my girlfriend underwater and she is a blur also.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Trash, move on.", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}
