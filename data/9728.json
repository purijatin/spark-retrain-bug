He enjoyed having it to play with and I don't regret the purchase.Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. This isn't a professional, well-crafted waterproof machine, it's a disposable camera in a protective shell. It works just fine but the picture quality is just average. We were on St. John and the water was crystal clear, but it looks murkier in these photos. Again, that's perfectly acceptable for the price, but have realistic expectations or you'll be disappointed.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1397260800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2014"}
