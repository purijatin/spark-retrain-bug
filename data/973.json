Nguyen", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewtext": "Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.  The standard analog cable that was included with the Rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic price & a great cable!", "unixReviewTime": 1269475200, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2010"}
