I have now used 9 individual cameras and have never had a problem.  The color to me is fantastic, however the ocean is just a little more blue than real life which is not a problem for me.  You take a picture by pushinig a lever and than wind a few turns to get to the next picture.  The ease is slightly difficult as you are in a body of water trying to swim and focus at the same time, but i think you would have this problem with any camera.Over time I have spent as much on the disposable camera as I would have if I bought a new digital underwater camera and in hind site I think I made the right purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does a great job", "unixReviewTime": 1258934400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2009"}
