VCR tapes are all but impossible to find locally so I was thrilled to find good quality tapes here at a decent price.  So far, they have produced good quality recordings and I have been able to reuse them without issue.  I plan to stock up on more very soon!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good quality VCR tapes at a good price!", "unixReviewTime": 1391731200, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2014"}
