I have used these tapes for years and have never had a problem.  HOWEVER, I don't ever buy tapes online, only in a store.  I fear that tapes will get wrecked during shipment so I prefer to get them at a store.  The tapes are good when you get a good batch.  I have tapes that I recorded years ago (some as far back as 2004 and even earlier), and they still play almost perfectly now.  It's a little more pricey to get them in a store versus on the internet but you will have a better chance of getting good tapes, so it's worth it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good tapes but don't buy online", "unixReviewTime": 1068854400, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2003"}
