After a long search to get tapes that would capture bright colors without making them appear blown out, I found TDK VHS tapes.Things I like about them:Good colorExcellent SoundMany re-records and playbacks without deteriorating.I used 1 TDK tape to record Glenn Beck every evening while I was at school last year at 5PM, at the end of the semester, it was still going strong. 1 hour record then 1 hour playback every night from August to December. Deep black, bright white, crystal clear sound.The VCR I used was a Panasonic PV-9455S on EP speed.Another great application is VHS camcorders, I have a Sharp VC-C20U and I was having difficulty capturing good video with it until I discovered these tapes. In all it's 1986 glory, my Sharp camcorder was capturing high quality video with stereo sound just as well today as it was all those years ago.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent tapes", "unixReviewTime": 1279843200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2010"}
