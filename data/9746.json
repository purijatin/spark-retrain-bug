I got the Canon PSC-60 soft case sight unseen since it seemed like a nice complement for the camera. The quality of materials is good, but the design seems simplistic and minimalist to the extreme and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of functionality.I moved on to the Lowepro MX10 (which is now called the Lowepro D-Res 10 AW, only the colors have changed a bit). For about the same money as the Canon case, I get:-a reclosable belt loop (with strong velco attachment)-removable neck strap-soft tricot lining (no scratched LCDs with this case)-room for an extra compact flash card (a bit tight with a CF plastic cover, perfect fit with just the card)-room for 4 extra AA batteries, even with the extra compact flash card in the case as well-a weatherproof and durable fabric-wide top-opening full zipper top-reasonably thick paddingOverall, the Lowepro bag looks like it was made for the Powershot A80 (and presumably the A70 and A60 as well), the camera fits just a little loosely by itself, but perfectly with 4 extra AA batteries and a spare compact flash card.I can't say anything negative about my Canon camera, I love it. The PSC-60 case, however, leaves a lot to be desired, and much better options exist out there. I highly recommend the Lowepro case.One final note: Lowepro has a \"matrix\" on their website to match many different camera models with the appropriate bag. For the Canon Powershot A60/A70 (similar size as the A80), the matrix recommends another bag (the D-Res 8S), but I tried both in a store and the MX 10/D-Res 10 seemed a better fit, with more room for extras (CF card and batteries).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect fit for a Canon Powershot A80", "unixReviewTime": 1071532800, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2003"}
