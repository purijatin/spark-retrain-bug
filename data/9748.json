The choice of camera was directly related to the size, so I didn't want a big bulky case.  The Lowe website tells you exactly which bag to buy for a particular model of camera, which is great, otherwise I probably would have ordered the wrong one.  But just like they said, the camera fits snugly inside, there is a bit of room for a couple extras.  For traveling, hiking, cycling, and whatever else I can get myself into, this is a great little case that protects well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A perfect fit", "unixReviewTime": 1047945600, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2003"}
