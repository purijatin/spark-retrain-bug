I own a Canon A620, and it fits snugly in this carrying case. There's just enough room left to store a case of 4 batteries, though it's a tad on the tight side. A nice little pouch is included to hold an extra memory card, useful for those who travel with more than one. My only gripe with this bag is that the neck strap is not quite long enough. It would be great if it were a foot or more longer, making it easier for me to wear it across my torso, rather than simply hanging it over my shoulder.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy Camera Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1184457600, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2007"}
