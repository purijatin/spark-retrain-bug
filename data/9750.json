However, it is a bit tight when trying to fit 4 'AA' batteries but it is acceptable.  The quality of the bag is top notch and the fabric inside the bag won't scratch the lcd screen.  The hidden cover is a bonus!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Also purchased for the A20", "unixReviewTime": 998265600, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2001"}
