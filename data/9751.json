I recently purchased a Canon A20 digicam as a backup for my Canon S100 Elph. Both are excellent cams. I bought the Canon PSC100 bag for the Elph, and though it fits like a glove, and retains the slick Elph form, it has no protection, little storage space, or extras. If you drop the bag, even on the carpet, you're done for. And did I mentioned there's no special cloth material to protect the LCD screen?Now for the LowePro bag. This baby's awesome! It has enough compartments to store 8 extra AA batteries &amp; 1 extra CF card, or 4 extra AA batteries &amp; 3 extra CF cards. Plus, the material hugging the digicam's very plush, creating a warm and protective feeling. And there's also something special in the back. You can actually pull out a nylon hood to cover the bag on a rainy day. They thought of everything. Excellent work LowePro.Highly recommended for any digicam... Just find one that fits your cam's dimension.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than the original", "unixReviewTime": 992995200, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2001"}
