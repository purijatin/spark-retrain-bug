However it is not ideal for the Panasonic DMC FZ35 & I returned it. There's too much unsuable extra space for this camera. You can't fit the camera with lens hood facing forward, the hood must be reversed, therefore you have 2+\" of empty space above the LCD screen plus a way oversized exterior form factor. Lowepro recommends the Rezo 110 AW which fits the FZ35 much better & is smaller overall but with a lot more useable extra space. I bought the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 which Lowepro doesn't recommend for the FZ35. It fits the FZ35 perfectly (with lens hood reversed) like the old 35mm SLR ever-ready cases used to fit. The camera goes in & out easily & quickly with everthing attached & there's room in a front pocket for a spare battery, lens cleaning cloth or bulb brush & the battery charger (if you really want to stuff it). The TLZ 10 is hardly bigger than the camera & is unobtrusive. It is slghtly more expensive than then Topload Mini which points out what a bargain the Topload is for the right camera: a larger form bridge camera super zoom like Canon's or other brand digital SLR with small zoom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Topload Mini Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1266019200, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2010"}
