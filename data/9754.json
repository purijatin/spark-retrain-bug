Fits it perfectly with a bit of room for batteries and other small accessories.  Mostly there is just room for the camera itself though.  If you have extra lenses or flash, it wont fit.Very nice and easy to use, top loading is nice and good for quick-access.  The little plastic-lined zip pocket in the top is good for holding memory cards.  I also have the Apex 110 AW bag and I switch off between them depending on the occasion.The triangular form factor is very nice and fits snugly up against your back without getting in the way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice pack", "unixReviewTime": 1255046400, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2009"}
