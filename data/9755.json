It has just enough room for my D40 camera and strap in the main section while a spare battery and lens pen is in the outside pocket. It is tight to fit the strap in however it feels secure in the case. I would have to get a larger one if I upgrade my lens over the 17-55 I have now.I feel the cushioning is quite good for the bag and it is just great for a person who wants to travel light.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Snug Bag.", "unixReviewTime": 1194134400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2007"}
