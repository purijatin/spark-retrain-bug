Very sturdy construction and a decent amount of padding without making it bulky.  The non-slip surface under the top of the shoulder strap does well at keeping it on your shoulder.  I love that the top of the bag opens away from me for easy access to the camera and protects me from dropping it as I'm trying to put it back in.  The front compartment has plenty of room for extra batteries and even a couple of filters.  This is the perfect bag for roaming around the Smoky Mountains taking photos on the trail.By the way, one other review stated that this bag was a perfect fit for their Fuji S9100. No, no, no!!!  I have an S9100 and getting it in this bag requires that I wriggle, push, and STUFF it in.  Way too tight.  Made me very nervous that I would damage my camera trying to get it back out.HOWEVER, this bag was perfect for my Fuji S5100, a considerably smaller zoom camera.  Guess that's why Lowepro calls this a \"mini zoom\" bag.  The next bigger size of this bag is a fantastic fit for my S9100 with plenty of room but not too much.  If you're debating between the two bags compare the size of your camera to these two Fuji cameras and let that be your guide.  Great bag, no fear..........", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great mini-bag", "unixReviewTime": 1210377600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2008"}
