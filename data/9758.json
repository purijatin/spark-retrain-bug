It fits the Fuji HS10 (and HS20) just right, with a small amount of looseness.  The pocket in front has room for all the extras.  The HS10/HS20 is bigger than the S2000, S1500, and S1800 cameras, and so needs a slightly bigger bag. This bag also comes with a belt loop.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great fit for Fuji HS10 and HS20", "unixReviewTime": 1270944000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2010"}
