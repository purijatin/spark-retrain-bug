Bustillos", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I bought this bag along my Canon Rebel XT with kit lens (18-55mm), and it has a quite perfect size, with little extra room to fit strap. Internal pocket accomodates a couple of CF cards and external allowed an extra battery and charger.When I bought a 28-135mm IS lens, the bag turned a little tight to fit this big lens but putting strap along lens instead over back of camera, I would be able to walk around with it.Unfortunately I bought a Canon 40D, and with 28-135mm IS lens the bag don't accomodate at all the new combination, so I'm moving to a TLZ 1 bag instead.Bottom line: it's a nice, reliable and resistant bag, with enough padding to protect camera and lens from small bumpings, light and inexpensive. A good choice for small SLR cameras with a small lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very compact camera bag", "unixReviewTime": 1211241600, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2008"}
