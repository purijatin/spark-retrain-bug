There is just enough room left inside that I can squish my neck strap in there too. I've also found that the outside pocket has room to hold three film canisters. This bag is great if you want to fling your camera over your shoulder for a quick walk to the park or a trip to a ball game.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good bag for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1024012800, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2002"}
