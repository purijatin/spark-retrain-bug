The canon XSI w/ the kit 18-55mm IS lens fits snugly if you know how to position the camera. First, drop down the camera strap into the base of the bag (see picture #1 that I uploaded). Then put in the camera. Then Fold the strap over and rest it on top of the lcd screen. The strap will provide a second layer of cushinging for the lcd screen. The bag is the most compact one that you can get out there. The front pocket fits the charger, the nikon lens brush that I bought, and a few memory cards. Great value. Note, don't expect to fit any other lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fits XSI/450D nicely", "unixReviewTime": 1214784000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2008"}
