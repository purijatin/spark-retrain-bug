NYSTEDT \"Magnus\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "I had tried a number of cases for my Konica Minolta DiMAGE A2 camera and I had found one that could take all my gear (A2, BP400 battery grip, Sigma flash, filters, remote release, batteries, cf cards, cleaning stuff), but I also wanted something smaller that I could take with me when I didn't need all the stuff, and this is it folks! I cannot fit the BP400 on the A2 but that's ok. The little pouch takes a polarizer filter, an extra battery, a CF card and that's all I need on shorter outings. It's made of durable stuff that will keep some water and dirt away from your camera. Hang it on your belt (which I do most of the time) or wear out on your shoulder. Great bag at a great price and Lowepro's quality is well known.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great case for Konica Minolta A2", "unixReviewTime": 1091145600, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2004"}
