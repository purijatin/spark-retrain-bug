Comfortably holds the D40 and its kits lens with the Nikon strap inside. Holds the SD card in the inside pouch and the spare battery in the outside pouch.Cant hold the charger and its cord though. But with a spare battery and with Nikon's efficiency you dont have to charge quite often so its not a great minus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good deal for a reasonable price", "unixReviewTime": 1217203200, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2008"}
