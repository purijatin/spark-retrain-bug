It would work with any of the stock 18-55 or shorter lenses. The D40 works fine in this case too. It's well made, too bad it isn't a couple of inches longer!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Case, Doesn't Quit Fit Nikon D80 With 18-200 VR Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1192320000, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2007"}
