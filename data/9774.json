It is in fact a nice, snug fit for the D70s or D80 with the 18-55mm VR (or any shorter) lens. Just wrap the neckstrap loosely around the lens before putting the camera in and it fits fine. I also use it for a Panasonic FZ35, a much more compact camera. If you just put an FZ35 alone in this bag you'd have enough room left over for a ham sandwich, but the neat thing is you can put it in with its large lens hood attached -- very handy since the hood cannot be reversed on this camera. Then the bag is just the right size as to length, though still with extra room on the sides but that causes no problems.Made with the usual LowePro quality, and the flap opening from the near side is a really good idea. I liked it so much I bought a second one and may buy another one or two. Though I'm not likely to carry more than one at a time it's a good place to store a camera as well. I have a couple of larger size LowePro bags of this type that are useful when carrying a camera with a longer lens and/or larger body, such as the D200.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good bag for small to medium sized DSLR", "unixReviewTime": 1268092800, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2010"}
