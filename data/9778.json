However, there are no pouches inside the front pocket to permit better arrangement of batteries and memory cards.  Because of this design oversight, I returned this bag and purchased theLowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Baginstead.  The TLZ 10 has a smaller front pocket but inside the pocket there are two pouches.  Note, however, that the TLZ 10 will not accomodate as long a lens as will the TLZ Mini.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good bag but needs pouches inside the front pocket", "unixReviewTime": 1259625600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2009"}
