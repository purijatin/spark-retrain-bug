I can fit my Canon 30D or my wife's Canon Rebel XT with an EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens UV filter and lens cap without problem.A couple of nice features:- the non-slip surface of the shoulder strap actually works.- the \"backwards\" opening of the flap while it seems funny at first is actually safer to use.- the adjustable velcro bolsters allow you to set the support for the right sided handgrip lower thus keeping the camera back level.- the front pocket is big enough for my charger and an extra battery while the inner mesh pocket holds an extra memory card and a cleaning cloth.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best little SLR bag I've found", "unixReviewTime": 1207267200, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2008"}
