It's a little snug on a couple of my lenses but I don't mind that too much.  The front pouch is big enough to fit a lens pen, usb cable and any other small accessories you may want to carry.  My camera is a Canon XS which is one of the smaller DSLRs out there.  If you have a bigger camera, this probably wouldn't be a good bag for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice compact bag", "unixReviewTime": 1235260800, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2009"}
