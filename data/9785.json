Easley \"Opa\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "I bought this camera bag last year and use it every day.First, for me this is great for carrying my camera when I go into the nearby mountains.  It holds all the equipment I need and is very well made.  Lowepro Topload Zoom Mini Camera Bag is made of thick insulated material.  This bag will protect my digital camera and discs in an insulated, well padded container.  I am comfortable with security and safety issues for my photographic equipment.  As a special bonus the bag is very light weight and, with its shoulder strap and top carrying handle, it is very easy to carryLately I have discovered a great secondary use for this Lowepro Topload Zoom Mini Camera Bag.  I have several items that I must have with me or at close access: PDA to remind me of medicine times, appointments, and essential tasks; a cell phone to keep in contact with friends and associates; medicine for controlling unexpected bouts of pain, indigestion, angina; and meters to check my oxygen level and blood pressure (especially going into the mountains).  Carrying all those items in my pockets is cumbersome and uncomfortable.  However, all of the vital items fit nicely in this bag, so I become free for a few hours to simply enjoy the day and the beauty of creation.I recommend this product.  It has many possible uses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Versatile Valise", "unixReviewTime": 1267488000, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2010"}
