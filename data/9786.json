You can't fit both lens in it of course, that's not what it's for.  I also have the Nikon strap attached do my D40 and it easily fits inside this topload zoom mini bag.  I don't know what other people mean by this bag is too small, it's the perfect size.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "perfect for the D40 with either 18-55 or 55-200mm lenses", "unixReviewTime": 1201824000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2008"}
