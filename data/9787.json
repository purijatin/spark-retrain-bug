{"reviewerID": "A1O229NVVDJUX2", "asin": "B00004TX71", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewtext": "I have owned the mini version of this case for my Olympus E-510 for about three years now and have not have any issues with it, so I though I'd buy this full sized version for my recently purchased Canon 7D, and I am happy to report that it fits the Canon nicely.  With the kit lens (28-135) the 7D has a little wiggle room on both sides and about half an inch form the back of the camera to the top of the bag.  By folding the 7D's strap up behind the camera it fills that extra space nicely.This is not the case to get if you like to travel with a lot of accessories and lenses though since there is not much room left when you put a camera like the 7D in it.  It has a small pouch on the underside of the cover, perfect for a compact flash card or two, and another larger pouch on the front of the case.  The larger pouch can hold the charger, a cable or two, and a few more compact flash cards.  The case also includes two little Velcro dividers to section it off if your camera is significantly smaller than the case.The case is nicely constructed and can stand up to an occasional sprinkle of water.  The padding is not very thick, but works well for minor impacts.The one thing I don't like about the case is the new shoulder strap.  On the older mini version the ends of the shoulder strap were sown down.  On the new one you get extra material hanging off the strap if you shorten it.  Not only does this extra material get in the way, but also the strap is a bit less secure.All in all... the prefect case for a larger semi-pro SLR (Canon 7D and 50D and Nikon D300s), but a bit too big for consumer level SLRs (Canon Rebel and Nikon D3000).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nicely fits the Canon 7D with the kit lens.", "unixReviewTime": 1260748800, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2009"}
