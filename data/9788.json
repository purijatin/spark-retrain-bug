It holds my D5000 with a 55-200 lens attached without problem. However 95% of the time I use a 35mm prime lens and with this lens attached there is a lot of space on top (which I dont mind as there is room for the camera strap). It also has a generous pocket for holding a spare battery, a filter and even squeezing in a tiny table-top tripod. Though I have never tried it, there should be space to fit in a mini speedlight as well such as the SB400 in the pocket or the main compartment below the camera.This is a good bag for carrying around the DSLR camera with a single attached lens. The straps can be adjusted and there is a belt loop as well. The quality is typical Lowepro quality, which is very good.The only con is that the shape of the bag makes it obvious that you are carrying a SLR camera, and this makes the bag stand out in situations where you may want to be discreet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice bag for a compact DSLR and medium zoom", "unixReviewTime": 1276128000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2010"}
