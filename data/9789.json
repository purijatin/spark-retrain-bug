My Nikon fits lens down in it, and there is just enough room around the edges and top to squeeze my tamrac strap in as well.  For the most part I don't attach any straps to the bag and just carry it by the handle.  Since it's inexpensive, I also purchased the chest strap, which holds the bag snug against your chest but makes it very easy to retrieve the camera without removing the strap.  Although I've test-fitted the chest strap, I haven't taken it on a hike yet so I don't know if I'll like it or not.I held back a star, probably unfairly, because the fabric of the bag seems a bit thin and unexceptional.  I don't think this is a performance issue at all - I just would have preferred something thicker and more tactile, like ballistic nylon.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect fit for my Nikon D50 and 18-200 VR", "unixReviewTime": 1167782400, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2007"}
