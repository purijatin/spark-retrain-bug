Tolman \"Andy in ME\"", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewtext": "My Nixon D80 with the 18-135 lens fits very nicely, and is quick to retrieve. The small pockets hold battery, spare memory, and a filter or two. The strap goes over one shoulder comfortably, or can make it a waist pack. Camera feels lighter in the bag than dangling from its neck strap, and it reduces the paranoia of bouncing it off something.  Don't mistake this for a system bag. It's a great thing to take on a walk or to an event where you know the lens on the camera will do what you need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "just right", "unixReviewTime": 1188604800, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2007"}
