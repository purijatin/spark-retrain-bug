That's everything I need for a day out with the kids.My only gripe is that I wish it had a SlipLock receiver on the sides for my little point & shoot Lowepro cases to attach to.  All Lowepro would have to do is just not stitch on the existing support strap that runs between the D rings on the sides of the case.  In fact, I might just try unstitching it.The case is a perfect fit for me, especially for the price point (I paid around $18 in March 2010).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfectly fits Nikon D300 with 18-200mm lens", "unixReviewTime": 1282780800, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2010"}
