Bailey \"Bryan Bailey\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "Lowepro makes great inexpensive camera bags and the Topload Zoom Mini is exceptionally well designed.  Very sturdy construction and a decent amount of padding without making it bulky.  The non-slip surface under the top of the shoulder strap does well at keeping it on your shoulder.  I love that the top of the bag opens away from me for easy access to the camera and protects me from dropping it as I'm trying to put it back in.  The front compartment has plenty of room for extra batteries and even a couple of filters.  This is the perfect bag for roaming around the Smoky Mountains taking photos on the trail.By the way, this bag was a perfect fit for my Fuji S9100.  However, the Lowepro Mini Zoom bag was perfect for my Fuji S5100, a considerably smaller zoom camera.  If you're debating between the two bags compare the size of your camera to these two Fuji cameras and let that be your guide.  Great bag, no fear..........", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great bag for my Fuji S9100", "unixReviewTime": 1210377600, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2008"}
