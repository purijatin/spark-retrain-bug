This is a great little bag for times when you don't want to haul your entire inventory of gear.  It is the perfect size for my Nikon D80 with the 18-200mm VR zoom lens mounted.  There is just enough room on the left side of the camera to tuck in the camera strap.  The pouch on the front is just right for a few filters and an extra battery.  An especially nice design touch is the way the top of the bag flips outward, away from your body, so you easily see into and access the contents of the bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great bag when you don't want want to haul it all", "unixReviewTime": 1199664000, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2008"}
