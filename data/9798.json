The reviewer mentioned that that this Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 Camera Bag was a perfect fit for the Nikon D-50.The reviewer was absolutely correct.  This bag easily holds my Nikon D-50 with the 18-200mm zoom lens attached (with some room to spare).  The inside padding is adjustable for your particular camera and lens.  I found there also is room for my 72mm filters, memory cards, and a spare battery.  This is a great carry around day bag,  I would probably opt to take this bag on vacation too because of its condensed size.  It has a belt loop and shoulder strap for more carrying options.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect bag for Nikon D-50", "unixReviewTime": 1156723200, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2006"}
