I wouldn't go and submerge the bag, but if you're caught in rain you shouldn't have to worry about your camera getting wet.- Has plenty of padding.- Spacious interior - more than enough room for a Digital Rebel XT/XTi. If you have a bigger camera, it will most likely fit inside as well. I find the extra space left over is useful to hold my wallet and iPod, in case I don't want to carry another bag.- Two pockets, one inside and one outside. Great for storing lens filters, lens caps, small papers, and memory cards.- Adjustable and/or removable strap. 4 D-rings to attach whatever you want. Loop in the back so you can use a belt or a chest harness.If you have a big camera with a big zoom lens, you might want to get the next size up. On the other hand, if you want a snug bag for your small DSLR, then the Mini would probably be better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great little bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1194739200, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2007"}
