Miller \"Digital Photographer\"", "helpful": [35, 35], "reviewtext": "This holster fits a D200 with 18-200mm lens perfectly.  Some other reviewers have complained that the case is too big, but with a higher quality DSLR and a medium length telephoto this bag really shines.  The front pocket holds plenty of CF cards and spare batteries.  There is a little pocket on the underside of the lid which is perfect for holding filters and polarizers when not attached to your camera.I use this bag clipped to the shoulder straps of my Arc Teryx Bora 80 backpack.  In my setup I have the bag hanging across my chest just below my sternum.  During a trip across Glacier National Park (51lbs pack, 6 nights) the case always had my D200 ready.  I typically leave the top flap zipped a couple inches on each side to keep the camera secure. Even while crossing rough terrain, scrambling over scree and kick stepping across snow fields this bag left little to be desired.  It hangs steady and does not bounce too much.If you are looking for something to hold your camera while out backpacking I don't know of any better solutions out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent holster for use when backpacking", "unixReviewTime": 1185667200, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2007"}
