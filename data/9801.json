However, it's quite a bit wider and taller than is necessary.  It's really quite a big bag for an SLR holster.  I can't see what the extra space is for, unless you have an older generation DSLR with a bigger body.  The camera is reasonably located inside, so it shouldn't flop around too much, but if you're looking for something snug and neat, this isn't it.If you have a shorter lens (like the kit lenses, then go for the Lowepro Topload Zoom Mini, but with the 18-200 lens the Mini is about half an inch too shallow - otherwise it would be ideal, and much, much smaller than the Zoom 1.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok, but oversized", "unixReviewTime": 1173052800, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2007"}
