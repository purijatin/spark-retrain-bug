Portas \"KNOBmeister\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "Great product for NIKON D90 SLR camerasLove the style of this bag as it fits my D90 with a 18 - 105 lens.Have a similar bag [LowePro TLZmini] for my NIKON Coolpix 5700 but this bag is deeper so that the D90 fits with the longer lens ..... Features that I like are the padding that protects my gear from the everyday bumps and knocks that happen when transporting my camera as well as the external and internal pockets that hold my extra \"Film' and spare batteries.Size of this bag will not accept an extra lens but I never carry an extra lens so I prefer the snug fit so the camera does not 'flop' around in the bag. {I carry my camera while rock climbing} If you carry extra lens buy a traditional camera bag.Very pleased with the construction fit and durability of the materials in this productGREAT PRICE TOO!Joe", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NIKON D90 camera Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1262822400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2010"}
