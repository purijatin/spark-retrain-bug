I chose this bag because of all the other good reviews on it from people who were also looking for the perfect bag for their Nikon D50. (Thanks for all you reviews!)I just received this bag and it fits everything I need: D50, the 18-55mm kit lens, spare battery, extra filter, and it even fits my other lens, a 50 1.8 (in the external pocket). Perhaps if I become more advanced and would like to carry around more camera gear this would not be able to fit those any longer. But for the bare necessities that I own, it's perfect.There is still a little bit more room to spare in the bag while the camera is in it. There is a  zip pocket on the inside of the top flap for more accessories and an external pocket that seems to be able to fit quite a bit more.It feels sturdy and light, with just enough cushioning, for normal everyday use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fits my D50 and accessories perfectly", "unixReviewTime": 1173052800, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2007"}
