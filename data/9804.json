Contrary to other posts here, it is a fairly tight fit.  I use a D300 and lens from both 55mm F2.8 Micro to the 18mm-200mm zoom and it fits both.  The wrist strap that I use on the base hangs off to one side and does make the camera fit a little tight, but it still works fine.  Don't expect to carry much more in this case.  Stuff like thin straps and lens cleaners cloths are fine but not another lens or more than one/two lens filter.  Love the fact that this products opens faced to you.  The handle strap is also a great idea.  This product comes with a basic thin strap and has other options out there for upgrade.  Also hikers who use other packs will want to come up with an integrated strap solution that works for them, so unless you are in a real hurry, it might make sense to buy this and get the straps later.  There also is a small pocket that could hold something thin and small like a plastic cover for when you get caught out in the weather.....Opteka SRC-40 Large Rain & Elements Cover for Nikon D700, D300, D300S, D3000, D5000, D90, D80, D70, D60, D50, D40, & D40x Digital SLR Cameras", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for light hiking when you travel light", "unixReviewTime": 1265673600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2010"}
