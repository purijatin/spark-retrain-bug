This is it!  lots of room for your camera and the extras.  Easy access and easy to carry around without being in the way.  Good protection for any of your mid sized digital SLR cameras or smaller models with room to spare.  I've had lots of camera bags for much more $$$  but this does the same job for a great price.  Can't go too wrong with this item.  Buy one and save yourself the time and trouble of looking at more expensive bags that aren't any better.RCB  Oceanside, CAOoops!  Amazon is the place to go for this item.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good bag for the buck!", "unixReviewTime": 1268697600, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2010"}
