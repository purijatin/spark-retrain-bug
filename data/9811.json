The D700 and a 28-300mm lens fit's perfect, a D50 and an 18-55mm fits a little loose but the internal spacers can be adjusted to fit.  There's a small pouch in the top flap for memory cards, and the top pocket is just big enough for either a battery and charger or extra filters.  For a day trip or just a small package to carry it's just about right.  The zippers are nylon and have held up to over two years of use, and the bag is reasonably weatherproof--I've been able to take it through snow and light rain without a problem.  I'm a little mystified about why it has two additional D rings on it, which I assume are for additional straps to carry it like a backpack.  The only thing I'd like to have seen extra on this bag is maybe a label window for those of us who own multiple cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My standard carry bag", "unixReviewTime": 1263081600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2010"}
