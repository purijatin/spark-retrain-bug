Finally made the huge leap to a new Cannon EOS DSLR.  A huge investment for me.  It only makes sense to protect my investment and I picked this case.  Plenty of room for the camera and stock lens (18 -55mm compact zoom).  The interior adjustable stops cradle the camera high or low in the pouch, near custom fit.  Limited depth will allow for lenses only so big but every camera bag has limits.  Handy pockets inside for extra memory or filters, outside big enough for battery charger and filters lens cleaner.  The top zippered flap opens intuitively for easy access.  Eventally I may out grow this case but I imagine it will come in very handy for years to come.  Can't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Soft Sided Camera Vault", "unixReviewTime": 1269820800, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2010"}
