The bag is a little oversized but I figured a general bag for all cameras would not result in a snug fit. The sides are pretty thick and shock absorbant. That was my biggest concern was that the bag could take a few minor bumps and not damage the camera. It has a few nice little pockets for the extras and a decent sized outside pocket (although not big enough for a lens-could hold a cell phone, small wallet, car keys, etc.). I can hardly wait for winter to end so I can take my camera on a hike and get some good pics.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good little bag", "unixReviewTime": 1265673600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2010"}
