My Nikon D40 with 18-200 zoom lens fits perfectly in the main bag.  I put my 55mm macro lens in one of the pouches and Speedlite flash and filters in the other pouch.  The pouches are removable if you don't need them or you can buy bigger pouches for bigger lenses.  If I want to carry more gear in a backpack, I can still carry my SLR on my hip with this bag and have instant access to my camera.  The waist belt with compression straps holds the bag very securely and comfortably when I'm out hiking.  For the cheap price of this bag, I really can't ask for anything more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "perfect fit for Nikon D40 with 18-200 zoom lens", "unixReviewTime": 1209772800, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2008"}
