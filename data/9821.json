I  take my camera with one lens, extra memory card and battery, my small cell phone, small water bottle, car keys and trail bar.  All fits well in this little pack.  It's tight with my 100 mm macro lens, but it fits.  I usually put it on in front, put the strap around my neck and cradle the camera in the middle pouch with the top open so it's easy to access.  Other items go on either side. Sometimes I sling my camera on my shoulder and pack more stuff in the trail pack and wear it on my backside when  I'm going farther.  It's light, water repellent and is cushioned to protect contents.  I like the quick buckle and it adjusts quite a bit.  I've lost 15 lbs and still able to adjust it down.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "just what i wanted", "unixReviewTime": 1259020800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2009"}
