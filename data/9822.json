Yeung", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewtext": "After spending countless hours searching through countless shops and online stores, I found the perfect bag for what I needed.  I needed a bag  that could carry my Canon S5 IS + a lens while I was on my bike.  I use one of the lens cases to carry my wide angle lens and the other case to carry either my bike tools, a can of beer, or a bottle of water (you can order a water bottle holder for this bag separately to replace one of the lens cases).  The bag doesn't sway from side to side when I'm climbing hills and it stays put once you adjust the waist band correctly.The only thing I'd change about it is the way the excess waist band belt's held back against the main belt.  It's a bit of a flimsy design on that part and the excess strap always comes undoneBesides that little flaw, it's a good bag and I'll be keeping it for the years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does what it's supposed to do.", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}
