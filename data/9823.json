Thorpe \"Tom\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I purchased this bag based on the reviews and was concerned whether it could/would handle my Canon Rebel XT with a Tamron 28-300mm lens.  The camera, with lens attached fit fine and the side compartments can hold my 18-55mm lens and camera accessories.  The unit is compact and light.  It serves the user well when taking a weekend trip or going on a hike as it frees up your hands while protecting the camera and lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product for the hiking enthusiast", "unixReviewTime": 1256860800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2009"}
