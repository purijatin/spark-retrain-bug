I don't have a lot of camera equipment but what I do have is somewhat unusual. I needed a bag to carry a recently acquired Fuji GSW690 III medium-format camera, along with my Rollei QZ35W rangefinder, and a few miscellaneous extras, such as a Pentax spotmeter for the Fuji, extra 35 mm and 120 mm film, my little Fuji Tiara APS point and shoot camera, extra batteries, and so on. This is every piece of camera equipment that I own, but it fits nicely inside this small backpack-style bag.The Fuji is a fairly large camera, although it isn't that heavy, since it's mostly polycarbamate plastic. But it's all-manual--it doesn't even have an internal light meter--hence the need for a spotmeter. This odd assemblage makes for an awkward arrangement in most camera bags, but the backpack format works great. After rearranging the internal dividers I had something that fit perfectly and wasn't that bulky. The only complaint I have is that the backstraps aren't detachable, but this isn't a big deal. All-in all an excellent choice for someone who needs to do some customizing on the bag interior to suit a special need.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A good  choice", "unixReviewTime": 983318400, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2001"}
