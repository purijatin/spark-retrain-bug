However, now that I have it, it is working great.  Features I was looking for were light weight, small size, and (obviously) stable.  So far, it meets all those expectations for a very small price.  The legs extend smoothly and still lock down  solid.  When fully extended, I think the pod is quite solid, even when I am moving the camera while shooting video with camcorder.  It has all the different movement points lockable so once you set it where you want it, it stays put.Overall, its simple, solid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Handy little pod", "unixReviewTime": 988675200, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2001"}
