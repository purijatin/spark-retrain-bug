I've had this for at least 15 years and it's stood the test of time well. During this time, I've used this as a outdoor and indoor tripod as it's fulfilled it's purpose well.For outdoors, the main thing is the weight. I don't want to lug a heavy tripod around and this is very light weight because it's made of aluminum. The clips for the leg extensions are snap open/close and they are quick and easy to use.Height wise it adjusts up for a 6ft tall person and the head tilts, pans and rotates. Overall, I highly recommend this for price, ease of use, weight, and longevity.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice!", "unixReviewTime": 1316476800, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2011"}
