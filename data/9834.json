This was the cheapest one I could afford. Usually when you go cheap with photography you pay the consequences. Not this time. 12 years later when I am getting back into photography more seriously I pulled it out, dusted it off and expected to use it only temporarily until I can get around to getting a \"real\" tripod for semi-pros. That's not going to be necessary. It is lightweight but sturdy, with a great handle, quick, smooth gears/buttons to adjust height and tilt that tighten well, etc and is just an all around solid machine. I've taken beautiful photos for HDR using this. If you want to save money financing this expensive hobby here is one of the few ways to do it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sturdy, quality for money", "unixReviewTime": 1360454400, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2013"}
