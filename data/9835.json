Almanza", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "I jokingly call this tripod my \"little monster,\" and if you buy this tripod you'll see why. I swear this thing is heavier than some other full-size tripods. It is sturdy, REALLY sturdy, and includes all the functionality of higher end larger tripods. I love this wonderful little tripod, and for how much it costs versus other small tripods, I HIGHLY suggest getting this one!! You'll definitely be happy that you did. Solid construction, smooth tilting and panning, and high functionality make this a must buy for anyone wanting a tripod capable of performing low-angle to extremely low-angle shots, and definitely makes it my beloved 'little monster.'", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A 'Little Monster' of a Tripod!!", "unixReviewTime": 1266624000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2010"}
