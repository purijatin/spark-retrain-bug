Velbon makes great tripods.  Yes, you could spend thousands for a pro tripod, but you dont have to!2) Height.  I have a large tripod (Velbon model ordered from Amazon) that I use for portrait shots, etc.  However, for macro owrk and other shots that require close quarter and/or low to ground access, this is excellent.It also works with both cameras and camcorders, which is very handy. The 3-way pan head is critical in a tripod, and of course it has a quick release like all Velbon tripods.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb tripod for low shots", "unixReviewTime": 987638400, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2001"}
