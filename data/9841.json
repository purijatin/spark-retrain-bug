There are better ways to do this, but this is a lot cheaper than a bigger tripod that can get down low. It's also a nice travel tripod - it's light and small.On the downside, it's pretty much plastic. And heavier SLRs are at it's limit. But - for the price and the fact that it doesn't pretend to be more, it does the job.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Little tripod, little price", "unixReviewTime": 1251504000, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2009"}
