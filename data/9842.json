The tripod is very sturdy and is great for the price.I love how it compacts down to a foot - fits in a suitcase great. Supports my 5D2 with 24-70L quite well.To make it better:Allow alternative heads - a ballhead would be much better for photo work.Use better clamps. The leg clamps are the cheapest part on it - and I would have liked to see better plastic used. The legs are strong and metal - would have liked that level to been consistent throughout the rest of the design.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Travel", "unixReviewTime": 1244851200, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2009"}
