Lubin", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I just receives my second Velbon UP-4000 monopod, replacing one I've had for almost fifteen years.For twenty dollars or less, you can't go wrong, especially if you are over six feet tall. Fully extended, this monopod reaches to the point between my chin and lower lip (I'm about 6'2\"). Adding a mini-ball head (you will need to) and quick release plate brings the viewfinder on my DSLR higher than eye level. Most monopods this long cost $60 or more.It is also very sturdy, with aluminum D-shaped tubing, which means you can lean in on a fence or table-edge without it rolling off. The foam grip makes it comfortable to carry against your shoulder or use as a hiking stick, one of my main uses. The wrist strap is maybe a little small for some people, but another loop of something could easily be added. The rubber foot retract to expose a metal spike for hard, rough terrain and screws back down for indoor use. The three lever locks are very secure and easy to open and close.Monopods are great to keep handy, not only to brace the camera for low light shots. I've used the timer and flexible monitor screen to hold the camera up above a crowd or over a wall...a cable or wireless remote release is great, too. I use mini-bungee cords to lash it to a tree or fence...lots of uses.What happened to my old one? An internal plastic part on the middle lever lock gave way, this after nearly 15 years of hard use on steep mountain terrain as a walking stick. Not many things under $20 last that long. I was able to Gorilla Glue the joint shut, so now I've got a second monopod, still long enough for hiking, as a back up.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value for tall people", "unixReviewTime": 1284076800, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2010"}
