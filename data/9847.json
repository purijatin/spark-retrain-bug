At a fraction of the price of other monopods, this one is well worth the price.  The three section extensions of the leg seem to be made of aluminum or another hard metal, and are very stiff to give good support.  The last piece of the leg can get wobbly at times, but this is expected since it is the most skinny of all the sections.  The quick locks on the legs are made of plastic but are built well.  They clamp strong and the legs cannot move once clamped into place.  The bottom piece is plastic, not rubber, but is threaded and can be removed to replace with whatever type of material you would like.  I would have preferred rubber, but this doesn't affect much for me.  The handle is made of a soft cushion material which is angled to fit nicely in the grip of your hand.  The wrist strap seems to get in the way most of the time for me so I took it off.  Folds down to a relatively decent length for travel purposes.  Highly recommended for a cheap price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lightweight, Cost Effective Monopod", "unixReviewTime": 1141862400, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2006"}
