A surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps locked.The only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expect.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great video tripod for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1241481600, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2009"}
