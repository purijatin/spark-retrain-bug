I just couldn't believe that it would be any good.  I was pleasantly surprised by this tripod. It's extremely easy to use and most importantly, its smooth.  I wasn't in the market to spend hundreds of $ on a Manfrotto or something similar, and honestly for the type of shooting I do this is perfect. If you're looking for a tripod and were about to spend $25 - $30 on something you might find at Walmart, etc., I can tell you that it is absolutely worth stepping up to something like this.  You will definitely appreciate it once you use it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product and extremely affordable", "unixReviewTime": 1358121600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2013"}
