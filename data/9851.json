It's light enough to carry hiking, and it's got indoor and outdoor feet built in. It's got the bubble level and adjustable friction on the fluid pan/tilt mechanisms. It's stiff enough to be used as a periscope with a 3lb camera attached (grab all three legs together with two hands and hold camera up over a crowd).It survives a lot of banging around and the head is solid - but after dropping it from hand height onto the concrete one of the leg extension locks broke. They have some strange tiny pieces of plastic inside- seems unnecessarily complicated and flimsy. I replaced it with parts ordered on the phone from velbon. Two years later another one broke - I think the airline smashed my luggage that the tripod was in.So here's the three issues that make it short of perfect:Leg extension locks should be redesigned without tiny flimsy plastic parts inside.It isn't as light and compact as some tripods are.It's cheap but not free.So handle with reasonable care, buy a spare if you're a pro, and enjoy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Three issues short of perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1381017600, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2013"}
