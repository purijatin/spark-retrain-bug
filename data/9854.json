I have no experience with professional tripods, however, this tripod is built well if you are careful. People must really smash their equipment around to complain about this tripod being cheap. WEll built, However the fluid head has double adjustment. There are two screws that increase the pressure of the fluid making the tripod drift back during pans. These need to be loosened a bit if the tripod is drifting back too much. The other adjustments lock the tripod in place, Firm feeling and acceptable. Retractable spikes on the feet for outdoors. Built in level. Fantastic tripod if you are used to cheap-o Walmart tripods.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fluid Head!", "unixReviewTime": 1262822400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2010"}
