Duncan", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I am an amateur videographer who does mainly sports videos of my son's high school basketball games. I use this with a Panasonic HDC-TM 900 camcorder. While on the tripod, I don't do as much zooming in and out. But the smoothness of tilt and pan are a noticeable improvement. Also, it is much easier for me than holding the camera in my hand, or on a monopod. I am very happy with this purchase. The tripod folds up nicely and is very easy to carry in its case.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this tripod.", "unixReviewTime": 1393459200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2014"}
