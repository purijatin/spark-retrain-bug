It does not have a fluid head but it nevertheless pans and tilts VERY smoothly.  There are better tripods out there although for much higher prices.BTW, There's a reason they named it \"VideoMate...\".  I've used it many times for still photos and in most situations that I've used it -- the tripod works fine. But this tripod was not designed for still photography.  Almost everyone who purchased this would probably realize that this tripod is primarily intended for video.  All one has to do is to notice at the name of it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great tripod for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1297641600, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2011"}
