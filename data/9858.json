I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pretty nice... for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1203206400, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2008"}
