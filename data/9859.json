Stalls", "helpful": [51, 53], "reviewtext": "I spent A LOT of time trying to find a reasonably priced tripod that had true fluid-head smooth panning and tilting.  I have my own videography business, and had spent $100 on a tripod that was jerky when you tried to pan or tilt.  This velbon cost $60 and is incredibly smooth for pan and tilt.  The tripod is a little bit too light weight.  i wish it was a bit sturdier.  but other than that, excellent tripod for the price.  To get a significantly better tripod, you'd have to pay at least $180.update: 8.1.07after having used this tripod for close to a year, it no longer performs well.  the camera sits crooked on the head now and the tripod is useless.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the price, this tripod is amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1137715200, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2006"}
