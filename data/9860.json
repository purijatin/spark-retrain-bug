For double the money, it's 10 times better. It pans super smooth. I've never worked with a tripod so fluid. Very quiet, unlike my cheapo tripods.It's not a heavyweight tripod, but more of a traveling lightweight tripod. There's no creeping at all once you set the tension where you need it. My vertical tension adjustment had to be tightened as tight as I could possibly tighten them with my hands, and I have quite strong hands. Don't know if I had a faulty item, but it works for me.The quick release is very large and takes quite a few attempts to get used to attaching. Would've been nice if it fit a standard Bogen release.You can lock the vertical pan easily so you have only horizontal panning. Or vice versa. Great feature.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well worth the money.", "unixReviewTime": 1212537600, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2008"}
