Gush", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "My second tripod, I purchased this after buying my Canon Vixia HV-30 and realizing that It didnt have a LANC port, so I didnt need an expensive tripod with handle controls. The head on this is amazing, allowing for incredible pans. The head is extremely fluid with easy control levers. Its heavy enough to be sturdy, yet light enough to cary around no problem. It also comes with its own carrying case which is really convenient. The reasons I give it four stars: The head plate comes off easy, but when putting it back on the lever has come back and jammed into my fingers numerous times. One of the other main reasons I purchased this tripod was that I do a lot of night time photography, and this tripod allows for vertical shots. Having my heavier camera on there tilted all the way forward to do a vertical shot felt very unstable.Other than that, all around great tripod.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1211414400, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2008"}
