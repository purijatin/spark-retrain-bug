I usually travel with two cameras and an assistant shoots in parallel with the second camera so I can edit between both cameras.We bought this Velbon tripod for the second camera because it is light, sturdy, reliable, and offers a remarkably-smooth fuid-like head.  Nothing screams \"amateur\" as much as jerky video motion. With this tripod, your pans and tilts can be as smooth as velvet with a bit of practice.I was surprised to see the reviews here that were negative.  Our experience with the unit has been nothing but positive, and it has seen travel to France, Austria, and a variety of locations in the USA.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT fluid-movement tripod for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1330992000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2012"}
