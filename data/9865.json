This is my second Velbon VideoMate 607 tripod.  The first one worked so well that I decided to buy a second one of the same make and model.  The fluid head works very smoothly.  My pans look very professional.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it is not as steady when the column is elevated.  Other than that it is a very good value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tripod for camcorder", "unixReviewTime": 1277769600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2010"}
