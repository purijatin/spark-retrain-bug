Unfortunately it shows as some of the components do not feel solid or feel a bit loose, even when tightened up.  For the price I can't complain, this tripod has very smooth movement and is very stable.  It's not super light but not difficult to lug around.  The quick attachment for the camera is not always quick as it can be difficult to get it set in just right, but after a few uses it gets a bit easier.  I'd definitely buy one of these again.update:  Their is a plastic piece that holds the legs in and seems to be poorly built and breaks easily.  Unfortunately I was directed to return to the maker, which is very difficult to get ahold of being in England.  They want me to ship the entire unit there and wait for them to fix it, which hardly seems worth the cost and effort.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Great, except for one stupid cheap part.", "unixReviewTime": 1309737600, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2011"}
