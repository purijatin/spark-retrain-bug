I've had it only a week and am already wondering how I did without it. The fluid pan head makes a HUGE difference in following the action while zoomed - good-bye to herky-jerky videos at last! The carry case makes it a lot more portable than I expected. I upgraded from a tripod that cost 1/3 as much, and it's well worth the extra. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great video tripod", "unixReviewTime": 1243209600, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2009"}
