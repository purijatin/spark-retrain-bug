The product works exactly as advertised, it's lightweight yet durable, and it's held up to at least a year of being luggesd around to various events.  This isn't professional quality by any means, but it's a great entry level tripod for video cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Quality and Functionality for the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1255305600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2009"}
