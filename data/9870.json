The cardboard box I was using to hold my CDs in my car had run out of room and they were sliding all over the floor.  This keeps them all neat in one location and I can find what I am looking for quickly and easily.  I like keeping my CDs in their original cases and this allows me to do just that, even double CDs.  I would definitely purchase more of these as needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Storage to spare", "unixReviewTime": 1316217600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2011"}
