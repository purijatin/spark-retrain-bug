It's a useful size and organizes cds well, but it's not very substanital: has no padding and only a thin fabric shell.  It is essentially a bag with 2 plastic cd organizers in it.What I'd hoped for was something similar with some padding, or the nice heavy material case logic uses in it's envelopes, books and other cd cases.  This is not up to par with other products from this company.That said, it was surprisingly difficult to find a portable cd organizer which stores cds in their cases.  That it does.  So if that's what you need, and you can't find a suitable substitue, this will work,  Just don't expect it to be the same quality as their other products, or you will be disappointed (as I was).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not  par with otrher case logic products", "unixReviewTime": 1164412800, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2006"}
