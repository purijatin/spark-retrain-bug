I wished I had more, though I accomplished a lot with just the one pack because I was able to bundle multiple cord sets together. This is a very basic tool, just like the Velcro wraps that come on most computer power cords, though a bit shorter. I can't remember what I paid, but I remember imagining that they could have been less expensive. That said, I understand that Velcro is a pretty expensive product for those who manufacture products using it, my cost resistance could have been unrealistic. I do like that they were different widths, and that there were some very thin ones for smaller cords.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "simple but effective", "unixReviewTime": 1401840000, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2014"}
