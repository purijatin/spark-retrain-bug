They have tags that allow the tie to be easily removed and do not attach throughout the cable but only on a small section near the end of the cable.  This allows you to more easily wrap a cable and hold it tighter then the velcro brand straps.  Definitely recommend!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nicely designed, Easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1361577600, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2013"}
