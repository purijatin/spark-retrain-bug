Add to that fact that they're only grippy on about an inch at the end and they're best for larger cables.  They definitely won't work for ear buds or small, thin cables as they're far too large for that use, which was my primary plan when I purchased them.  Instead, they'll be used to organize power cables under and around my desk.  Which is not a bad use and the color coding is nice, but that wasn't my intent when I purchased them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fine, but for larger cables", "unixReviewTime": 1386720000, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2013"}
