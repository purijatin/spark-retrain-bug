My DVB80 came with 20 pages to start with  - and the album for $29.99.  So - if I wanted 20 pages to use in my many albums - then it would cost me  $47.96 (4 x $11.99 refill cost)!!!!I could purchase 2 NEW DVB80 albums for $59.98, get 40 refill pages and get 2 binders to use for other purposes!!!Does Case Logic think it's customers are idiots???", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "What a RIPOFF!", "unixReviewTime": 1193788800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2007"}
