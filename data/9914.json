I find that I can wear these headphones for hours on end without getting sore ears, which would happen with several other similarly-priced headphones I have tried.The level of sound blocking done by these earcups is phenomenal. You can wear them without even plugging them in and enjoy a significant reduction in ambient noise. This also adds to the quality of sound you get when listening to music, particularly in noisier environments.My only complaint is the volume knob in the cord. The knob sticks out symmetrically from both sides of the plastic housing, so it's impossible to tell which direction to rotate it to increase or decrease the volume without either trying and listening, or looking at the black-on-black markings, which are very hard to see.These work great with an iPod, I find that leaving the headphone volume knob turned up all the way (which essentially means that it's passing the signal through without dampening it) and the iPod around half volume is a comfortable listening level.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great sound, great price", "unixReviewTime": 1104364800, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2004"}
