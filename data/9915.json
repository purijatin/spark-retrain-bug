Guernsey", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I bought these a couple years back after reading good reviews, and they continue to be a very versatile set of headphones.  I now use them when recording drums in my home studio and the bass is amazing.  Their isolation capacity isn't as good as in-ear phones like the shure e3c's I use, but they are more convenient to pull on and off and more comfortable that the e3c's.One I boosted the bass a little bit too much during the playback and these headphones handled it wonderfully.  I was very impressed.There are better over-the-ear/isolating headphones, but not at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Replaced my wireless headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1163376000, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2006"}
