I am now buying them again because they were so great, so I decided to write a review.Just as everyone else is saying, the sound quality on these is amazing.  The bass is surprisingly good for what they cost, as are the mids and highs.  Very clear sounding but not tinny.  I have been to audio equipment shops and listened to other headphones that cost more than 3x what these do, and I would still rather have these headphones regardless of cost.  I suppose if you have $80 or more to spend on headphones, then maybe look into sony studio monitors or something else, but if you don't, these outperform anything I've seen under $80.  That's why I'm buying them again.  Note: they broke from my friend sitting on them, but that doesn't mean they're flimsy.  I must have sat on them 20-30 times but any headphones will break if sat on at the wrong angle.  Buy them, you will not be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1110240000, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2005"}
