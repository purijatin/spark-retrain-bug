Frequency Response, 10Hz to 27kHz; 40mm drivers; 16ft Cord; Volume Control IN Cord; dual Gold connectors. There are headphones with similar specifications selling for 2-4x as much.Anyway, I have had these headphones for 5 years and they are really fantastic. The cushioned leatherette earcups, the frequency response, etc.. all are a pleasure.These headphones are real helpful when watching those great movies when the kids are asleep. You don't miss a beat, literally.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "$40 Wonders", "unixReviewTime": 1135900800, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2005"}
