Audio and Video are both delivered fine. It's good length, too. Not sure what else you could want from a cable. I suppose it's a little loose in the 550, but I'm not sure if that's the cable or the graphics card itself.Anyhow, let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works perfectly", "unixReviewTime": 1345507200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2012"}
