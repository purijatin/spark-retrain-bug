Teofilo", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewtext": "The noise reduction in these headphones is good, and they don't drain the battery fast.  As long as the phones are fitted tight to your ear, the noise reduction works pretty well.  If you travel a lot, like I do, you'd want a stronger headband than these have.  The folding function is good, and they're compact when folded up and put in the included carrying bag.  But when you travel a lot, like I do, the folding parts of the phones wear out pretty quick.  The function still works well, but I'm trying to figure out a way to reinforce the headband so it clamps better to my ear.  It's a bummer there's not a better midlevel, more durable folding noise reduction headphones that are at a midlevel pricepoint.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good performance at a decent price...not the best if you travel a lot.", "unixReviewTime": 1178928000, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007"}
