Consider a product like Koss' \"The Plug\" instead.I bought a pair of these about 18 months ago and use them regularly on airplanes. They are a substantial improvement over the usual cheap headphones provided by the airline, because of the noise reduction, the \"around the ear\" instead of \"on the ear\" construction which itself seals against outside noise, and the sound quality.The sound quality is quite acceptable for airplane listening. They don't stand up to good quality headphones that don't have NC and don't fold up, but their convenience makes up for it.They don't sound as good as the Bose headphones that are sometimes handed out on business class, but they are substantially cheaper.Two minor downsides. First, they can get uncomfortable after a few hours of listening. Second, there is a little plastic cover for the battery which recently came off and got lost, and now the battery sometimes falls out and gets lost.Overall they are a substantial improvement over what the airplane gives you. You can actually understand the spoken parts of a movie. They are compact, light, and easy to carry around so they are always in my carryon bag, and I use them a lot.I wouldn't be surprised if some of the newer units in the same or slightly higher price range would be better, as this is an older unit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A reasonable buy for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1036886400, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2002"}
