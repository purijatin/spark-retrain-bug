Like the 850's they're true \"foldaway\" headphones--light, compact, comfortable, convenient to carry and wear.  Unlike the 850's they use a two-sided, rather than a single-sided, cord connection, and they require insertion of a battery (which makes them marginally heavier).  The sound is efficient, or responsive, and bright if not brilliant.  But in side-by-side comparisons with my other headphones, including Panasonic RP-HT710's and Sennheiser PX-100's, the Panasonic 100's are definitely wanting in terms of balance, spaciousness, and fullness.  If you don't mind the cumbersome size and 16-foot cord, the Panasonic RP-HT 710's are hard to beat for the price.  Otherwise, the Sennheiser PX-100's are the inescapable choice--little overachievers that not only make the ride but hold their own against the more costly and conspicuous competition.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good idea imperfectly executed", "unixReviewTime": 1076889600, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2004"}
