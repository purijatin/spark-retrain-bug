I first thought that noise cancelling would REALLY cancel every noise, but that would be too dangerous walking on the street-deaf. It cancels tiny sounds like ventilators(small ones). It really makes a difference when you put the headphones without cancelling and then with : you could say that it cancels without! The feel is firm and warm, so it's excellent Panasonic stuff.Pros :-Affordable-Solid body-Solid cord, but I don`t recommend pulling on any phones' cord especially Koss'(cheap...)-Superb sound-Panasonic has the best audio!-Portable-Uses one AAA batterie! It should last from 5 to 25 hours(average of 15)!Cons :-Don`t let the phones squish your ears, it hurts-Phones sometimes too small, depends on your physic-Fear of breaking due to plastic body(don`t drop it!)-For some, too expensiveWell, I live in Canada and it's most of the time winter here. Cold ears? No problemo. Annoying people? Still no problemo. This is a great gift for someone under depression or teens rave about cool headphones. It's also great to study with, but when it gets hot, remove them and let it cool itself.&quot;A superb gift for you family, yourself, or a bum down the street.&quot;&quot;Don't get carried away by Koss products which are not expensive, it doesn't last long enough compared to Panasonic.&quot;&quot;A little bit hot for summer... tssss... tsssssss... ummm... my ears melted!&quot;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb design!
