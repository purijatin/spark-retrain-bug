I wanted a compact camcorder with the convenience of mini digital videocassettes and firewire support that lets me edit video on my home PC. I also wanted a high quality and yet easy to use camcorder with a long lasting battery. PC100 has everything a video amateur needs.PC100 also have a built-in mega pixel digital still camera, although it cannot compare with specialized products like Nikon CoolPix cameras.The video quality is extremely high.The only complaint I have is the zoom control. It zooms in and out a bit too fast.I am very happy with my PC100. Worth the price!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top model for video amateurs", "unixReviewTime": 980121600, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2001"}
