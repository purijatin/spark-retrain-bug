Farra", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewtext": "The Sony digital camcorder records excellant video images and sound, but most TV set fail to reproduce the image quality and conventional VHS recorders lose the video quality when copying.  The still image quality is poor compared to stand alone 1 mega pixel cameras and cannot be used at the same time you are video taping.Works well with a iMac and iMovie for editing, could not see doing it any other way for less.  Some Sony home PCs also allow for editing using the same firewire interface with the Sony camcorder.Recommendation:  If you want super high qulaity video images and want the small size get this camcorder...But don't get it because it has a still image capability, instead get a nice digital still camera for that function.A side note: if you use a IR filter on this Sony and use the night shot mode you can view and record in infared.  Cool for experimental video effects and can be done likewise with most digital cameras I am told.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "nice but expensive", "unixReviewTime": 1006300800, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2001"}
