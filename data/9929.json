It is a lie.  The image quality is like magnifying a 640 x 480 to 1 Megapixel.  The result is coarse pixelation of the photo... I called the Sony customer support and they told me, \"if it looks good on the view finder, then Sony's job is done.\"  What [a lie].  Sony, wake up and don't tell lies!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lie about 1 Mega Pixel photos", "unixReviewTime": 1049241600, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2003"}
