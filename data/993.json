It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice Product", "unixReviewTime": 1307664000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2011"}
