After a lot of research, I almost didn't settle for  this camera, because although most owners loved it and it seemed  to have the best image quality in the class, it is rather  expensive. Looking at my savings account, and remembering  that the Video-8 didn't get used much because of its heft, I  took the plunge.The small size makes this an excellent camera to bring with you  in a sport jacket pocket, briefcase, or even jeans pocket (if  you're into those large raver-style pockets, that is). While  many of the buttons are small, I don't mind much, because the  few I use (start/stop, exposure control) are logically placed  and easy to push. I don't use any of the digital effects or fade  functions, because I transfer the video digitally to my computer and edit tape there -- something I never got around to with the  old clunker.I also don't use the still image capture much at all, because I  have a separate Kodak digital camera for that, and the memory  stick reader that comes with this camcorder is S-L-O-W (because  it's serial-only). If you have one of those VAIO machine with a  built-in memory stick reader, I suppose it would be OK. Transfer of video using the built-in FireWire (1394, i-Link, DV-gate, ...) port works very well, and I haven't had any problems getting  this camera recognized by my computer.The battery life is also amazing. The standard (slim!) battery  lasts for more than two hours -- the larger medium-sized battery  (which I use most of the time) gives you FIVE HOURS of running  time. If you can *at all* afford this camcorder, and don't need  the extra image quality of an (expensive, bulky) three-CCD  camera then get this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this handy-sized marvel", "unixReviewTime": 974851200, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2000"}
