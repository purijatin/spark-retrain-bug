A lot is included in the package but keep in mind that you will  need additional accessories to make the camcorder fully useful. You will  need the Flash/Light combination and also a larger memory stick to take  full advantage of megapixel quality - the one that is included (4MB) will  only hold six high-quality pictures. The battery is small but it will last  you forever - I never use my second one. Finally, be aware of the fact that  Sony will release the updated PC110 in September, 2000 which will have a  built-in Flash and will record short MPEGs to the stick. Will it ever come  to the States? Will you be able to wait for so long? You will surely pay  more. Go for PC100 instead.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It will impress your neighbors!", "unixReviewTime": 964483200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2000"}
