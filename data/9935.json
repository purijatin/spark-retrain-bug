It is very easy to use and has the power user features that you expect for a camera of it's class.  I use it for capturing pictures for the web and it's 2.1 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for that purpose. It comes with only 4 megs of storage, but is easy to upgrade.  Lexar noew makes memory sticks and the price is close to the compact flash prices.  I picked up a 32 mb stick and I can take about 80 pictures at the medium resolution of 1024x768.  The big drawback is the lack of an optical viewfinder.  The LCD display is very nice, but drains the battery.  It's also very difficult to see in bright daylight.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Delivers the goods", "unixReviewTime": 970444800, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2000"}
