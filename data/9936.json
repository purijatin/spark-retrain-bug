It takes crisp, clear pictures.  The flash is strong.  The battery life is excellent.  Unless you plan to enlarge your photos to 8\" x 10\" (and would need more pixels), I recommend this camera whole-heartedly.Last week, I used a friend's adorable, new Olympus Stylus Verve and I couldn't believe the difference in photo quality.  This old Sony takes pictures 100 times better.  It's also very easy to use, has a large LCD display that rotates--so you can turn it inward when not in use (protecting the screen) and you can take pictures of yourself without any guesswork.It's a great camera.  Grab one while you can.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big & Old, but Great", "unixReviewTime": 1114128000, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2005"}
