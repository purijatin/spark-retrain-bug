It comes with a good long lasting battery the NP-FM50.My only complaint is that the included memory stick is only 4MB.  At high resolution (1600x1200) you would only be able to take about 4 pictures.  I bought a 64MB stick the very same day and have had great success.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Camera", "unixReviewTime": 1009843200, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2002"}
