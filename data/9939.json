The Sony has always won my heart because of their Great reputation and Excellent Quality!  I was shooting for the DSC-F505 which has a lot of the same  qualities as this model.  I decided to go for the middle of the road in  price and chose the DSC-S50.  I  am thoroughly satisfied with what I have  acquired!  The picture quality is OUTSTANDING!  I was used to receiving  pictures that were 1.3mega pixels.. well this blows them away!  This camera  makes details crisper and cleaner than anything I've seen before.. it's an  Excellent camera and a must-have for sharing your life through e-mail!  Enjoy!UPDATE:  I dont know who wrote this!  I've never owned this product so never wrote this review!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Snappin Fool", "unixReviewTime": 963100800, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2000"}
