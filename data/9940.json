The USB port makes loading your pictures on a computer really easy. The controls and menu layout are similar to the Mavica, so if you have used that camera then you already know how the menu system on this one works. The small size and storage capacity are what sold me on this camera. As noted in some other reviews, a viewfinder would be nice, because if you are taking pictures outside, it can be difficult at times to see the image on the flip-up screen. But those are about the only drawbacks to this camera I can think of. I have taken most of my pictures at the lowest resolution, and even then, they are still EXCELLENT pictures. I even posted a picture of a book cover on ebay, and you could read every word that was printed on the book cover. I used the Macro mode and it worked great. I have used a Kodak and Mavica (not owned) in the past, and found the Kodak to be OK, but it isn't in the same league with SONY. I also have to give AMAZON a plug here too. They gave me great service, shipping costs were reasonable, and you save at least $50 or so compared to a typical retailer. This camera comes with a 4mb Memory Stick and I bought a 16mb for additional storage capacity, and I would definitely recommend getting at least that. They are a little pricey right now, but I'm betting the price will drop in the future. Overall, this is a great camera and you won't be disappointed if you buy it. Don't waste your money on off-brands.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony Comes Through", "unixReviewTime": 969580800, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2000"}
