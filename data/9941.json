I have nothing but great things to say about it...- It has held up through the worst abuse with me.  Even survived a few concrete drops.  Construction is awsome.- Optics are great.  I can get about 5in from an object before it gets blurry; and that is enough to get fine print off of something in great detail.  Zoom control is great once you get the hang of it.  Moving objects are usually no problem and you do not have to hold the camera extra-steady to aboid blurring either.- Colors are vibrant in most any light source.  I rarely have to mess with the brightness/contrast in PShop.  I don't know how, but image quality rivals 5 MP cameras that I've used.  I actually bought a Casio Exilim 5MP and resold it right away to stick with this.- Swivel LCD is useful for personal photos.  No dead pixels or problems with the LCD after years of USE!- Aftermarket batteries are $10 and work great.  Original used battery lasted 2 yrs.Might not be worth >$100 these days, but definitely close!  One thing's for sure, you definitely won't be the least dissapointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent camera even years later!", "unixReviewTime": 1166313600, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2006"}
