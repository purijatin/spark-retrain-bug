Since I have owned numerous (Including this one) Sony products over the years I don't think I am outside my realm.I always have a need for music either reviewing, archiving, or pleasure.  The Sony CFD-ZW755 grants the consumer many features without bloating the price tag.While it is not going to take the place of the high end system in your music room with its versatility it will be a welcome companion in an office, a guest room, or in proximity of the kitchen.  Batteries or electricity the option is yours.The AM/FM tuner locks in the stations well without the drifts often associated with lesser models.  There are settings to taylor the sound to your liking (Rock, Pop, Vocals).The dual tape enables recording from tape to tape, CD to tape, or radio to tape.  The CD portion of the unit is reliable when handled properly.If you don't want to spend endless time researching a good unit, Sony is a name you can trust.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book \"Take Me To A Circus Tent\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The price, feature, and company is right!", "unixReviewTime": 1182384000, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2007"}
