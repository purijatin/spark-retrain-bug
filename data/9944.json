This past week the volume control on my old Sony boombox broke (after nearly ten years of daily use) so I went out looking for a replacement. I was pleasantly surprised at the low prices of most of the units I saw, but they sounded rather tinny compared to the good sound I was used to from my old Sony. At the end of the shelf I found this model. When I inserted the CD which I had brought with me for auditioning, I immediately heard a clear improvement in sound over the less expensive models. In fact, the sound was even better than that of my old Sony with which I had been thoroughly pleased. I bought this model on the spot and the next day installed it next to my desk at work. It's very convenient too use, looks nice (compared to most current boomboxes) and sounds great. Sure it cost a few dollars more than the inferior-sounding units but(...) I'd say it's a great buy.Incidentally, although I listen almost exclusively to CDs, this unit has two tape drives, which allow for tape dubbing (which a lot of cheaper models don't) as well as a digitally tuned AM/FM radio. Also the CD player has 1-bit conversion -- like the best CD players, but unlike most boomboxes -- which contributes to the better sound. As I said, it's a great buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lots of features and excellent sound.", "unixReviewTime": 1027468800, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2002"}
