This boombox packs a lot of sound in a small package.  The speakers produce a clear, rich, thoroughly enjoyable sound, and the controls are extremely intuitive and easy to use.  The LCD display, though small and, unfortunately, not backlit, gives all of the necessary information for the mode (radio, cassette, or CD) that the boombox is currently working in.  The only drawback I've encountered is that there is no possibility to plug in external antennas, so the user is forced to rely only on the smallish telescoping FM antenna and internal AM antenna.  However, even weak FM stations are pulled in with relatively good quality, so long as the boombox is placed in the right location.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great compact unit", "unixReviewTime": 1335916800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012"}
