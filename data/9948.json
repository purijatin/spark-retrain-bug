Great CD player,greatcassette recorder,and great radio. The CD player didn't skip, andthe cassette player made great recordings. Both the G500 and theZW755 are great systems, but the cassette player is better on theZW755, partly because it was a duoble deck and you could recordoff of the other deck. This is a great portable unit! Way to goSony!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Sounding Stereo System!", "unixReviewTime": 1130716800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2005"}
