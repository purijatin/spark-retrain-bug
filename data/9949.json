Although I live in a large city the FM reception is practically non-existant. The antenna has to be set just right to pick up the strongest station in town, but even that dissolves in interference when a person or pet walks across the room or a car goes down the street. I've tried the antenna at different lengths and attached wires and foil to it to no avail. The AM reception is no prize either; the box has to be re-oriented just right every time you change the station.Now the CD player is dying. At first cleaning the lens helped a little but not anymore. Either the disc won't play at all or only plays the first few tracks, then spins out of control making a chattering noise. This is after very light CD use over the years. When it works it only plays factory CDs; it doesn't take CD-RW or mp3, and is very touchy about CD-Rs.That leaves the dual cassette players....they make a lot of mechanical noise when playing, and dubbing from deck to deck yields poor quality copies. Of course the cassette decks are purely mechanical, meaning they can't be remote controlled.This box convinced me Sony's days as a quality brand are over and is only cruising on its past reputation. The products lately are in the same class as Emerson & other cheapie store brands - preferring visual flash to catch kids' eyes while disguising junk inside.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "radio is useless, CD player is dying.", "unixReviewTime": 1229731200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2008"}
