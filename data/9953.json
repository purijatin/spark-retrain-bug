Looking around I ended up with this bag since it combines good quality and price. It is a very small and nice bag, which is easy to bring whenever you need your camera.Most days, when I don't use my camera, I store everything in the camera bag, e.g., camera, extra battery, battery charger, 2 flash cards and a plug converter. All fits, which is nice, keeping all accessories stored at one place. The battery charger and one of the flash cards are stored in the front pocket and in the big pocket I store the rest. However, whenever I use the camera, I remove the battery charger and the plug converter from the camera bag, so that I can store the extra battery and the flash cards in the front pocket. This way, I will only have the camera in the big pocket so nothing accidentally drops out when I grab the camera to capture that moment.I have used the camera bag for a 10-day vacation in which I visited crowded places such as Seaworld and Magic Mountain. These days I used the camera bag as a \"waist bag\" by tightening the strap around my waist just enough to keep the camera bag comfortably attached. This way I could have easy access to the camera and safely bring the camera bag in the roller coasters. Furthermore, this way of wearing makes it really hard for a potential thief to steal it. Moreover, the camera bag can comfortably be worn as it was supposed to do thanks to the easy-to-adjust strap. However, this strap is not detachable but I don't see why anyone would want to detach it.Overall, a very good product and a highly recommended buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very good product and a highly recommended buy", "unixReviewTime": 1023321600, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2002"}
