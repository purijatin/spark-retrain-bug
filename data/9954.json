The Caselogic bag is leather(ette) , has detachable straps, and you can secure it to your belt. The only exception is that you can fit a compact flash case in it and nothing more. The Caselogic because it is leather has a better feel and a more professional look to it for less. I've seen this Samsonite and didn't pick it up becase I found something else that better fit my Canon S40.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Get the Case Logic CPS50", "unixReviewTime": 1035158400, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2002"}
