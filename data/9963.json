Edwards", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "With so many decent looking camera bags to choose from, I opted for this one because of the price, brand and good reviews.I am just thrilled with it, the materials are excellent quality, it is well padded and has a decent \"low key\" color scheme. It holds both kit lenses for my Evolt 510, a telephoto lens, wide angle lens, spare battery, a flash and a few other bits and bobs.Everything fits just fine and there is still room for more....and the carry strap easily extends into a shoulder strap and makes for comfortable carrying as you would expect for a decent camera bag.One reviewer said it was big enough to hold Canada, throw in Texas as well, with room to spare!!!If you have a DSL camera and need a decent bag at a fair price, don't hesitate to buy this gem!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Construction, Well Designed", "unixReviewTime": 1223596800, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2008"}
