I also plan to buy 70-300mm lens. this bag could hold until now my camera and all its equipments. In addition, my canon g9. still there are places where I can put more things into it. the quality of the bag is great and will protect all your equipments easily. recommended for people who have many accessory and camera equipment. this is what I expected from Samsonite.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is what I really needed", "unixReviewTime": 1217030400, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2008"}
