I would have given it 5 stars but I took away one star because the zipper sucks.  one of the 2 zipper handles came off the track and is useless.  Real pain sometimes but at least the other works.  I took away another star because it's not that efficient with space.  One or two more small dividers would be nice as well as larger side mesh pouches or straps to hold extra lenses, waterbottle, etc.  The mesh pouches on it are useless.  Maybe put a lens cap in there.  Max height of bag can hold a Nikon DSLR w/18-55mm lens.  When I have my 55-200mm on the body its a smidge too long but still fits.  A padded neck/shoulder part on the strap would be nice but then again, this thing is only $20.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1247875200, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2009"}
