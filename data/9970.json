That, and it will cost you a lot less.I can't say it is better or worse than the Remote F, but it has all the same functions.  The only flaw maybe for those who use the added grip; this remote won't fit into the spot provided for a remote.  Never-the-less, I don't find it a big deal as I am sure most won't, unless you really use the thing a lot.This items is a great deal, altough as others have noted, be aware of the shipping fees.**** UPDATE ****I recently purchased a Pentax K5 and want to report that this remote will for it as well.  I'm not sure that it is any better than other Pentax controllers, but if the price is right for you, it will serve you well.It still has a nice shape and form and slides nicely into a small camera bag pocket.  I'm not sure the K5 grip has a space for a controller (even the Remote F), but the ability to slide a remote into the grip is a minor convenience that can be compensated for with camera straps or your camera bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for a K10d (also works for K5)", "unixReviewTime": 1214956800, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2008"}
