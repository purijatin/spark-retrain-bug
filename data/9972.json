But even with shipping (check the vendors for this) the remote is less than half the price of the C model. It works.With my K20D it triggers any of the remote modes the camera offers, immediate fire, 3 second delay, or remote continuous shooting. It works fine in bulb mode, though there is no lock. You have to hold the button in. In the dark the range is almost 20ft. In sunlight about 12.The Remote Control C has a sleeve that can be attached to a battery grip and which keeps the button from getting activated and the battery run down when it's thrown in a bag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super bargain", "unixReviewTime": 1240790400, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2009"}
