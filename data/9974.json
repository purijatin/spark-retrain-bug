It's advertised for TVs around 20 inches, but please note that is TUBE TVs, the old CRTs your parents have. If you use this for LCDs and plasmas, it will work up to 40-50\" TVs as long as the weight does not exceed the allowed specifications. I use it with my Westinghouse 37\" LVM-37w3 1080p monitor and never a problem!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No need to spend hundreds", "unixReviewTime": 1174435200, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2007"}
