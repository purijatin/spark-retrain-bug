Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive \"high end\" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for Canon EOS 7d", "unixReviewTime": 1270598400, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2010"}
