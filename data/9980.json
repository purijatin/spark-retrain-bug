There are some very expensive options out there that replace the entire TV stand, but I did not see the need to spend that much.  Then I saw the Sanus TV32 and TV27.  At first I considered the TV27, but I think if you are going to use a large LCD TV (like a 52\"), you should go with the TV32 model.  It fits the bottom of the Samsung 750 very well.  If you had a 46\" LCD, the TV27 would likely be fine.The base of this turntable is very, very solid.  It's hard as a rock actually.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more sturdiness in the actual turntable wheel, but it still works very well.  I can turn my large LCD very easily.  You can shake the TV and stand a bit, but I feel comfortable with the turntable.  You actually have to shake the TV with your hands, it's not like you can walk by the TV and have it shake from the floor.  It might not work with all large LCD TVs, but I do not hesitate recommending this product for standard TVs or LCDs.  You should give it a try.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Solution, even for large LCD TVs", "unixReviewTime": 1236729600, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2009"}
