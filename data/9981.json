It turns easily without spinning out of control.  The spinning mechanism is large enough so that the surface is level even if the TV is forward or back.  The rubber feet virtually lock it to the underlying table.The unit is unobtrusive, low and the rounded edges give it a finished look.Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It is nice when somebody creates a good product!", "unixReviewTime": 1195862400, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2007"}
