I usually order my film from a mail order supplier and they do not carry DX film which, from what I've been able to discover, means that there is more information bar coded onto the canister. This I could live without. However, the manual tells you that it's possible to use regular film though it may be a little more difficult to load, and furthermore it will always register as ISO 25 (not 100 or 200 or 400)! I was pretty unhappy about all this.We bought some DX film and had it developed, taking pictures in many different circumstances -- indoors/outdoors, with/without flash, articial/natural light, etc. The results were very good in all conditions.Next, we loaded regular Kodak film (ISO 200). I could not get the film to load. I placed the reel in with various lengths of film exposed but that didn't help. I tried to depress the shutter button as recommended in the manual, but that did not help. My husband got the film to load on the first try. (I believe this is because I had warmed it up for him.) Again we took pictures in many circumstances and the quality, surprisingly, was fine.The features offered work well. The manual is good.  Also, the battery is much more reasonable than previous batteries, which cost about [price].  I would say the only problem withe this camera, as with its predecessor, is a sluggish zoom mechanism.A very good camera at a good price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a decent camera with exotic film demands", "unixReviewTime": 999907200, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2001"}
