They are basically a toy, but the people who complain that they don't work on CB radios and the like, simply didn't read the Description which states \"with boom microphone will make conversing on your Midland family radio easier and more convenient.\"  These are ONLY for FRS Radios from Midland, but may work on other FRS radios as long as they have the same plug arrangement.  BTW, FRS stands for Family Radio Service as in Motorola TalkAbouts and the like, NOT CBs.  Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Good headsets like this cost anywhere from about $75 up.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Read Product Description and You will Know", "unixReviewTime": 1229558400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2008"}
