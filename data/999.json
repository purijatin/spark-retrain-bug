Wager", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewtext": "I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "didn't work for me", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}
