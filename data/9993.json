It's just some wire in a plastic mold and feels like to much tension would snap it.  If you can get past the issues of the boom mic, it works great.  Clear sound coming through and broadcasting.Please note, the vox function of the headset is ment to work in tandem with the vox function of your CB; if your CB doesn't have a vox function, DO NOT USE IT!  Keep the device set on push to talk and you'll have no problems.  The product warns you of this with a flyer, but you don't see that until you've purshaced it already.  My CB doesn't have a vox function, and the push to talk mode is quite functional.If the boom of this device was better designed, I'd likely give this a 5/5, but it's a huge annoyance.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "functional, but a bad design", "unixReviewTime": 1365465600, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2013"}
