I thought the push-to-talk button would get on my nerves, but it turns out that it really didn't bother me. I should caveat that I used it for one cross-country motorcycle trip, then never again.I actually ended up taking it apart and just putting the ear piece inside my motorcycle helmet while routing the boom mike around the front of my helmet. It worked perfectly - Exactly what I needed and a WHOLE LOT LESS cash than a specialty mic.So because it worked for my needs - I give it 5 stars.
