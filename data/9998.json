The phone does not use a standard 1/8\" plug, so you can't easily replace the headset with one that will work better.* The light that tells you which of the two lines the incoming call is on does not light constantly when a call comes in. (It's only on where there's actually a ringing sound, but not between rings), and you have to know which line is active before you can pick up (there are two switches, one for each line). So, you have to sit and stare at the phone for several seconds until the light comes on before you can answer. I usually guess wrong when I just pick one or the other of the lines. There's no \"pick up whichever line is ringing\" button.* It's very difficult to determine the position of the volume control. Since the control wheel is on the side and is very smooth, you can't even tell if you're moving it when you run your finger over it.* The phone does not go off hook automatically when you start dialing, so you have to remember to select a line, first.* There's no caller ID, which is obvious from the picture. I thought that this lack wouldn't be a problem, but it turns out that I rely more on caller ID than I had thought.In all, the phone is pretty worthless. I strongly recommend against buying it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Doesn't do the job.", "unixReviewTime": 1281139200, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2010"}
