I was surprised that there was no volume adjustment for the Mic -- every other Plantronics headset I've used had one.  I must have had a dozen people tell me they could hardly hear me in 3 days of use.  No amount of adjusting the headset position on my head solved the problem..  I had to pull the mic nearly into my mouth for people to hear me easily.Pity - other than that, it was perfect. I'm returning it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good for listening, not for talking.", "unixReviewTime": 1153526400, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2006"}
